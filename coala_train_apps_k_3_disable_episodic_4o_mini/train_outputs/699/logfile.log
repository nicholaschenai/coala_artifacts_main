## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (40 points):
- $N = 1$
- $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
5
1 5 31
4
1 10 3
23
2 5 7
20 36
2 5 10
19 2
3 3 300
1 1 1

-----Sample Output:-----
0
2
7
4
1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef wants to organize Division-3 contests over a certain number of days. Each contest requires a specific number of problems. There are multiple problem setters, each contributing a certain number of problems. The goal is to determine how many contests Chef can host given the total number of problems available, the number of problems required for each contest, and the maximum number of days available for hosting contests.

2. **Conceptualize a solution:**
   - For each test case, read the number of setters, the number of problems required for a contest, and the number of days available.
   - Read the number of problems each setter has created.
   - Calculate the total number of problems available by summing the contributions from all setters.
   - Determine how many contests can be formed by dividing the total number of problems by the number of problems required for each contest.
   - The maximum number of contests Chef can host is the lesser of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days available.

## Problem

Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \( A[i] \) by its index \( i \) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:

    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is "YES". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is "NO". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \( N \) natural numbers.

    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \( N(N + 1)/2 \). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.

    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is zero.
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
       - Returning "NO" otherwise.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
        
            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, A))

    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning "YES" or "NO".
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money to a group of minions such that he ends up with exactly zero money left. The key concepts involved were understanding the total demand from the minions and ensuring that each individual demand could be satisfied without exceeding the amount of money Gru had at any point.

    Initially, the approach was to simply check if the total demand equaled the amount of money Gru had. However, this was insufficient because it did not account for the individual demands of the minions. The correct approach required checking both the total demand and ensuring that each individual demand was less than or equal to the money Gru had.

    The final solution involved calculating the total demand and checking if it matched Gru's total money. If it did, the output was "YES"; otherwise, it was "NO". However, the solution failed to pass the tests because it did not consider the scenario where the total demand could be less than Gru's money but still not allow for exact distribution.

    The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of considering both aggregate and individual constraints when solving distribution problems. The final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Extract number of minions and amount of money Gru has
            A = case[2]  # Extract the list of demands from minions
        
            total_demand = sum(A)  # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by minions
        
            # Check if the total demand equals the money Gru has
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")  # Gru can distribute the money exactly
            else:
                print("NO")  # Gru cannot distribute the money as required
    ```

    This experience highlighted the need for careful consideration of problem constraints and the importance of validating both total and individual conditions in distribution scenarios.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Chef wants to organize Division-3 contests using problems created by several setters. Each setter has created a certain number of problems, and Chef needs a specific number of problems to host a contest. He wants to know how many contests he can host over a given number of days, considering he can only host one contest per day.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host:
   - First, calculate the total number of problems created by all setters.
   - Then, find out how many complete contests can be formed from these problems by dividing the total number of problems by the number of problems required for one contest.
   - Finally, the maximum number of contests Chef can host is the minimum of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days available.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function max_contests(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, D
           read A (list of problems created by each setter)
           total_problems = sum(A)
           contests_possible = total_problems // K
           max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Chef wants to organize Division-3 contests using problems created by several setters. Each setter has created a certain number of problems, and Chef needs a specific number of problems to host a contest. He wants to know how many contests he can host over a given number of days, considering he can only host one contest per day.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To determine the maximum number of contests Chef can host:
   - First, calculate the total number of problems created by all setters.
   - Then, find out how many complete contests can be formed from these problems by dividing the total number of problems by the number of problems required for one contest.
   - Finally, the maximum number of contests Chef can host is the minimum of the number of contests that can be formed and the number of days available.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function max_contests(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, D
           read A (list of problems created by each setter)
           total_problems = sum(A)

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

-----Input:-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

-----Output:-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
- $1 \le D \le 10^9$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (40 points):
- $N = 1$
- $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

1 10 3
23
2 5 7

19 2
3 3 300
1 1 1

-----Sample Output:-----
0
2
7
4
1

-----Explanation:-----
- 
Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
- 
Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
- 
Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

```python
def max_contests(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
        A = case[3]
        total_problems = sum(A)
        contests_possible = total_problems // K
        max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
        print(max_contests)

T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

max_contests(T, test_cases)
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for T in range(int (eval(input()))):
 N,K,D=list(map(int,input().split()))
 A=list(map(int,input().split()))
 P=sum(A)//K 
 print(min(P,D))


INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] The official solution is concise and effectively addresses the problem with minimal code. It follows a straightforward approach that aligns closely with my own solution, but it is more succinct. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses `eval(input())` to read the number of test cases, which is a compact way to handle input but can be risky if not controlled. Itâ€™s generally better to use `int(input())` for safety.

2. **Single Line Calculations**: The official solution combines the calculation of total problems and the number of contests possible into a single line: `P = sum(A) // K`. This reduces the number of lines and makes the code cleaner.

3. **Direct Output**: Instead of storing results in a list and printing them later, the official solution prints the result directly after calculating it. This is efficient for problems where immediate output is acceptable.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution maintains the same time complexity as mine, which is O(N) for summing the problems, but it is more space-efficient since it does not store intermediate results.

Overall, the official solution is effective in its simplicity and directness. It reinforces the importance of writing concise code while still being clear and functional. In future problems, I should aim to streamline my solutions similarly, focusing on reducing unnecessary lines and improving clarity.

The main function is `max_contests`.
INFO - [Task id] 699 [generation text] The function processes multiple test cases to determine the maximum number of contests that can be hosted based on the number of problems created by setters, the number of problems required for each contest, and the available days. For each test case, it calculates the total number of problems created and determines how many contests can be formed by dividing the total problems by the number of problems needed for one contest. It then compares this number with the available days to find the maximum contests that can be hosted. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

You are a helpful assistant that extracts important information from problems and solutions to aid in searchability and education.

## Instructions
- Read through the problem and solution carefully.
- Reason out, step by step, in what scenarios this knowledge would be useful.
- Focus on general patterns and situations to help connect this knowledge to new situations.
- Then, include a list of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair.

## Response format
Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

[Problem]
    Chef wants to host some Division-3 contests. Chef has $N$ setters who are busy creating new problems for him. The $i^{th}$ setter has made $A_i$ problems where $1 \leq i \leq N$.    
    A Division-3 contest should have exactly $K$ problems. Chef wants to plan for the next $D$ days using the problems that they have currently. But Chef cannot host more than one Division-3 contest in a day.
    Given these constraints, can you help Chef find the maximum number of Division-3 contests that can be hosted in these $D$ days?

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers - $N$, $K$ and $D$ respectively.
    - The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$ respectively. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the maximum number of Division-3 contests Chef can host in these $D$ days.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 10^2$
    - $1 \le K \le 10^9$ 
    - $1 \le D \le 10^9$
    - $1 \le A_i \le 10^7$ for each valid $i$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (40 points):
    - $N = 1$
    - $1 \le A_1 \le 10^5$
    Subtask #2 (60 points): Original constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    5
    1 5 31
    4
    1 10 3
    23
    2 5 7
    20 36
    2 5 10
    19 2
    3 3 300
    1 1 1

    -----Sample Output:-----
    0
    2
    7
    4
    1

    -----Explanation:-----
    - 
    Example case 1: Chef only has $A_1 = 4$ problems and he needs $K = 5$ problems for a Division-3 contest. So Chef won't be able to host any Division-3 contest in these 31 days. Hence the first output is $0$.
    - 
    Example case 2: Chef has $A_1 = 23$ problems and he needs $K = 10$ problems for a Division-3 contest. Chef can choose any $10+10 = 20$ problems and host $2$ Division-3 contests in these 3 days. Hence the second output is $2$.
    - 
    Example case 3: Chef has $A_1 = 20$ problems from setter-1 and $A_2 = 36$ problems from setter-2, and so has a total of $56$ problems. Chef needs $K = 5$ problems for each Division-3 contest. Hence Chef can prepare $11$ Division-3 contests. But since we are planning only for the next $D = 7$ days and Chef cannot host more than $1$ contest in a day, Chef cannot host more than $7$ contests. Hence the third output is $7$.
