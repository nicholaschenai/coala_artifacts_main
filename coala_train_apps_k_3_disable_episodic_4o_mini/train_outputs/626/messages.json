There are n appetizers numbered from 0 to n-1 such that if the appetizers are arrayed in this order, they will display the message. The Chef plans to display them in this order on a table that can be viewed by all guests as they enter. The appetizers will only be served once all guests are seated.\n\nThe appetizers are not necessarily finished in the same order as they are numbered. So, when an appetizer is finished the Chef will write the number on a piece of paper and place it beside the appetizer on a counter between the kitchen and the restaurant. A server will retrieve this appetizer and place it in the proper location according to the number written beside it.\n\nThe Chef has a penchant for binary numbers. The number of appetizers created is a power of 2, say n = 2k. Furthermore, he has written the number of the appetizer in binary with exactly k bits. That is, binary numbers with fewer than k bits are padded on the left with zeros so they are written with exactly k bits.\n\nUnfortunately, this has unforseen complications. A binary number still \"looks\" binary when it is written upside down. For example, the binary number \"0101\" looks like \"1010\" when read upside down and the binary number \"110\" looks like \"011\" (the Chef uses simple vertical lines to denote a 1 bit). The Chef didn't realize that the servers would read the numbers upside down so he doesn't rotate the paper when he places it on the counter. Thus, when the server picks up an appetizer they place it the location indexed by the binary number when it is read upside down.\n\nYou are given the message the chef intended to display and you are to display the message that will be displayed after the servers move all appetizers to their locations based on the binary numbers they read.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T \u2264 25 indicating the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of a single line beginning with an integer 1 \u2264 k \u2264 16 followed by a string of precisely 2k characters. The integer and the string are separated by a single space. The string has no spaces and is composed only of lower case letters from `a` to `z`.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case you are to output the scrambled message on a single line.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n2\n2 chef\n4 enjoyourapplepie\n\nOutput:\ncehf\neayejpuinpopolre\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\).\n\n    #### Key Insights:\n    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \\( f(P) \\) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \\( K \\) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.\n    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \\( f(P) \\)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \\( K \\) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.\n\n    #### Issues Encountered:\n    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \\( K \\). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.\n    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.\n\n    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:\n    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.\n    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet:\n    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \\( K \\). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                # Start with descending order\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_sum = max_value\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to reach K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_sum == K:\n                        break\n                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K\n                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)\n                    if max_reduce > 0:\n                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce\n                        current_sum -= max_reduce\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n        print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In my attempts to solve the permutation problem, I learned several key insights about the approach and logic required to derive a valid permutation that meets the specified conditions. \n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\). This understanding is crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a specific \\( K \\).\n\n    2. **Feasibility Conditions**: The official solution checks specific conditions to determine if \\( K \\) is achievable:\n       - For even \\( N \\), \\( K \\) must be within the bounds of \\( (N(N+1)/2 - 1) \\) and \\( 3((N/2)^2) - 1 \\).\n       - For odd \\( N \\), similar bounds apply, but with adjustments for the odd case.\n\n    3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution constructs the permutation by:\n       - Starting with a descending order.\n       - Adjusting elements based on the difference between the desired \\( K \\) and the maximum possible sum.\n       - Using a systematic approach to fill in the permutation while ensuring that the conditions for \\( K \\) are met.\n\n    4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution employs an iterative method to adjust the permutation based on the remaining value of \\( K \\) after accounting for the maximum possible sum. This involves incrementally modifying the permutation to reach the desired sum.\n\n    ### Code Snippet from Official Solution:\n    The official solution uses a structured approach to handle both even and odd cases, ensuring that the permutation is constructed correctly based on the conditions derived from \\( K \\).\n\n    ```python\n    if(n%2==0):\n        if(k<(n*(n+1))//2 - 1  or  k>3*((n//2)**2) - 1): print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    else:\n        if(n==1): print(1) if(k==0) else print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    The official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. My previous attempts failed primarily due to not fully accounting for the bounds of \\( K \\) and the systematic construction of the permutation. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and the need for a structured approach to constructing solutions in combinatorial problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. \n\n    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach of generating all possible strings by removing and reinserting characters was effective, and the use of comparisons to track the smallest string worked as intended.\n\n    The final implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each string, and outputting the results. The code was structured to first define the main function and then handle input/output, ensuring clarity and separation of logic. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    for i in range(N):  # Iterate through each character\n        char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to move\n        remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remove the character\n        for j in range(N):  # Try to insert the character at every position\n            new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]\n            if new_string < smallest_string:  # Check if the new string is smaller\n                smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of string manipulation techniques and careful iteration when solving combinatorial problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Binary Reversal Function**: The official solution defines a function `reversebinary(bits, n)` that constructs the binary representation of a number `n` with exactly `bits` bits. It builds the binary string by repeatedly taking the modulus of `n` with 2 and shifting `n` right until it reaches zero. This method ensures that the binary string is built in reverse order, which is crucial for the problem.\n\n2. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of test cases and processes each case by splitting the input into `k` and the message string. It converts `k` to an integer to determine the number of bits for the binary representation.\n\n3. **Rearranging the Message**: The solution initializes a list `newmsg` to hold the rearranged characters. It iterates over each character in the original message and uses the `reversebinary` function to find the new index for each character based on its upside-down binary representation. The character is then placed in the correct position in `newmsg`.\n\n4. **Output**: Finally, the rearranged message is printed by joining the characters in `newmsg`.\n\nThe official solution is effective because it directly manipulates the binary representation and efficiently constructs the final output without unnecessary complexity. My initial approach was similar but could have been optimized by using a dedicated function for binary reversal, as seen in the official solution. Additionally, the official solution avoids the need for string slicing and directly constructs the binary string, which may improve performance. \n\nOverall, the official solution emphasizes the importance of clear function definitions and efficient data manipulation, which are valuable lessons for future problem-solving."
