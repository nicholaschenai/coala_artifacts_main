## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (20 points):
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le N \le 10^7$
Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----

9

-----Example Output-----
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The process involves repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements from the sequence until only one number remains.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - First, we need to compute the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers. However, since N can be as large as 10^18, we cannot compute all Fibonacci numbers directly.
   - We can observe that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to a property known as Pisano period. Therefore, we only need to compute the last digits for the first 60 Fibonacci numbers.
   - Once we have the last digits, we can simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one number remains. This can be done efficiently by using the properties of binary representation, as the last remaining index can be derived from the highest power of 2 less than or equal to N.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function last_remaining_fibonacci_digit(N):
       # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
       last_digits = [0, 1]
       for i from 2 to 59:
           last_digits[i] = (last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10

       effective_index = (N - 1) % 60
       
       # Return the last digit corresponding to the effective index

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    The problem involved calculating the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The solution required understanding arithmetic series and efficiently calculating the sum without iterating through all multiples, which is crucial given the constraints (N can be as large as 1 billion).

    The approach used was to determine the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, then calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10 up to that point. The sum was computed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. This method is efficient and avoids potential performance issues with large inputs.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway is the importance of leveraging mathematical formulas for series to optimize calculations, especially when dealing with large ranges. 

    Hereâ€™s the core function used:

    ```python
    def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
        largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
        number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10
        sum_multiples = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2
        return sum_multiples
    ```

    This function efficiently computes the desired sum, demonstrating the effectiveness of using arithmetic properties in programming challenges.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1

                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of Fibonacci numbers. We start with the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers, and repeatedly remove the odd-indexed elements until only one number remains. We need to do this for multiple test cases, where N can be very large (up to 10^18).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - First, we need to compute the last digits of the Fibonacci numbers up to N. However, since N can be very large, we can't compute all Fibonacci numbers directly.
   - The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to a property known as Pisano periods. Therefore, we can find the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using this periodicity.
   - Once we have the last digits, we can simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one remains. This can be done efficiently by recognizing that the remaining number will be determined by the position of N in the sequence of last digits.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of Fibonacci numbers. We start with the last digits of the first N Fibonacci numbers, and repeatedly remove the odd-indexed elements until only one number remains. We need to do this for multiple test cases, where N can be very large (up to 10^18).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - First, we need to compute the last digits of the Fibonacci numbers up to N. However, since N can be very large, we can't compute all Fibonacci numbers directly.
   - The last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to a property known as Pisano periods. Therefore, we can find the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using this periodicity.
   - Once we have the last digits, we can simulate the process of removing odd-indexed elements until only one remains. This can be done efficiently by recognizing that the remaining number will be determined by the position of N in the sequence of last digits.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function last_digit_fibonacci(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 0
       if n == 1:
           return 1

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
- Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
- If $l = 1$, the process ends.
- Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
- Change $D$ to $E$.
When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] The problem involved finding the last remaining number from a sequence derived from the last digits of Fibonacci numbers, specifically after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements. The key insight was recognizing that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers due to the Pisano period. This allowed for efficient computation even for very large values of N (up to 10^18).

The solution was structured into three main functions: one to compute the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using the Pisano period, another to determine the last remaining number after the removal process, and a final function to handle input and output. The approach of reducing N by half in each iteration of the removal process was effective, as it directly correlated with the position in the last digits array.

The final implementation passed the provided test cases successfully, demonstrating that the strategy of leveraging the periodicity of Fibonacci last digits was both efficient and effective. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation. The solution is useful for similar problems involving sequences and periodicity.

def last_digit_fibonacci(n):
    # Calculate the last digit of Fibonacci numbers using Pisano period

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
import math

t = int(input())

a = [-1, 0, 1]

for i in range(58):
 temp = a[-1] + a[-2]
 temp = temp%10
 a.append(temp)
 
for _ in range(t):
 n = int(input())
 
 temp = len(bin(n)) - 3
 temp = 2**temp
 temp = temp%60
 
 print(a[temp])

INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] The official solution effectively leverages the properties of Fibonacci numbers and their last digits, particularly the periodicity of the last digits due to the Pisano period. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Precomputation of Last Digits**: The solution precomputes the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers and stores them in a list `a`. This is efficient because the last digits repeat every 60 numbers.

2. **Binary Representation for Index Calculation**: Instead of simulating the removal of odd-indexed elements, the solution uses the binary representation of N to determine the position of the last remaining number. The length of the binary representation minus 3 gives a power of 2, which directly relates to the index in the precomputed list.

3. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient in both time and space. The precomputation of the last digits is done once, and each test case is resolved in constant time by calculating the index using bit manipulation.

4. **Key Calculation**: The calculation `len(bin(n)) - 3` effectively finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to N, which corresponds to the last remaining number's index in the precomputed list.

In contrast, my initial approach involved simulating the removal process, which could be inefficient for large N. The official solution's method of using binary representation and precomputed values is a more elegant and efficient way to solve the problem. This experience highlights the importance of recognizing patterns and properties in mathematical sequences to optimize solutions.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 600 [generation text] The function processes multiple test cases by reading input values, where each value represents a number. For each number, it calculates the last remaining number after repeatedly removing odd-indexed elements. It utilizes a helper function to determine the last digit of a Fibonacci number based on a specific position derived from the input. The results for all test cases are collected and printed in one go. This approach efficiently handles the input and output while performing the necessary calculations. Overall, it provides a solution to the problem of finding the last remaining number in a sequence.

[Problem]
    The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
    Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
    - Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
    - If $l = 1$, the process ends.
    - Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
    - Change $D$ to $E$.
    When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
    - $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (20 points):
    - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
    - $1 \le N \le 10^7$
    Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

    -----Example Input-----
    1
    9

    -----Example Output-----
    3

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.
