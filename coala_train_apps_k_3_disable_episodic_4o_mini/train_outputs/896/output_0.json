    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Chef has a series of segments defined by their left and right endpoints. He wants to transform the first segment into the last one using the least number of operations. Each operation allows him to shift either the left or right endpoint of a segment by one unit, but he cannot create an empty segment. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required and the sequence of operations that achieves this transformation, ensuring that if there are multiple sequences with the same number of operations, the lexicographically smallest one is chosen.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each segment and calculate the necessary operations to transform the current segment into the next one. For each transformation, we will determine how many shifts are needed for both the left and right endpoints. We will keep track of the operations in a string format, ensuring that we always choose the lexicographically smallest option when there are multiple ways to achieve the same transformation. Finally, we will output the total number of operations and the sequence of operations for each test case.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function solve():\n       read T  // number of test cases\n       for each test case:\n           read N  // number of segments\n           initialize operations string and operation count\n           read segments into a list\n           for i from 0 to N-2:\n               current_segment = segments[i]\n               next_segment = segments[i+1]\n               calculate shifts needed for left and right endpoints\n               append operations to the operations string\n               update operation count\n           print operation count\n           print operations string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])  # Read number of segments\n        index += 1\n        \n        segments = []\n        for __ in range(N):\n            L, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read each segment\n            segments.append((L, R))\n            index += 1\n        \n        operations = []  # To store the sequence of operations\n        total_operations = 0  # To count total operations\n        \n        for i in range(N - 1):\n            L1, R1 = segments[i]\n            L2, R2 = segments[i + 1]\n            \n            # Calculate shifts needed\n            while L1 < L2:\n                operations.append('L+')\n                L1 += 1\n                total_operations += 1\n            \n            while L1 > L2:\n                operations.append('L-')\n                L1 -= 1\n                total_operations += 1\n            \n            while R1 < R2:\n                operations.append('R+')\n                R1 += 1\n                total_operations += 1\n            \n            while R1 > R2:\n                operations.append('R-')\n                R1 -= 1\n                total_operations += 1\n        \n        results.append(f\"{total_operations}\")\n        results.append(\"\".join(operations))\n    \n    # Print all results for all test cases\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the code\nsolve()\n```",
