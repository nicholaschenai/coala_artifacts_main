    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We have two jugs with specific capacities (x and y liters) and we want to find out if we can measure exactly z liters of water using these jugs. We can fill the jugs, empty them, or pour water from one jug to another. The goal is to determine if it's possible to have exactly z liters in one or both jugs.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if we can measure z liters, we can use the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The key insight is that we can measure z liters if and only if z is less than or equal to the total capacity of the jugs (x + y) and z is a multiple of the GCD of x and y. This is because any amount of water we can measure using the jugs must be a linear combination of the capacities of the jugs.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function canMeasureWater(x, y, z):\n       if z > x + y:\n           return False\n       if z is a multiple of gcd(x, y):\n           return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def canMeasureWater(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> bool:\n        # Check if z is greater than the total capacity of both jugs\n        if z > x + y:\n            return False\n        \n        # Function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD)\n        def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n            while b != 0:\n                a, b = b, a % b\n            return a\n        \n        # Check if z is a multiple of the GCD of x and y\n        return z % gcd(x, y) == 0\n```",
