INFO - [Task id] 364 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have two jugs with specific capacities, and we want to find out if we can measure out exactly a certain amount of water using these jugs. We can fill the jugs, empty them, and pour water from one jug to another. The goal is to determine if we can end up with exactly the specified amount of water in one or both jugs.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if we can measure exactly `z` liters using jugs of capacity `x` and `y`, we can use the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The key insight is that we can measure `z` liters if and only if:
   - `z` is less than or equal to the total capacity of the two jugs (i.e., `z <= x + y`).
   - `z` is a multiple of the GCD of `x` and `y` (i.e., `z % gcd(x, y) == 0`).
   If both conditions are satisfied, then it is possible to measure `z` liters.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function canMeasureWater(x, y, z):
       if z > x + y:
           return False
       if z % gcd(x, y) != 0:
           return False
       return True
   ```

    def canMeasureWater(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> bool:
        # Check if z is greater than the total capacity of both jugs
        if z > x + y:
            return False
        
        # Function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD)
        def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            while b:

            return a
        
        # Check if z is a multiple of the GCD of x and y
        if z % gcd(x, y) != 0:
            return False
        
        # If both conditions are satisfied, return True
        return True

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective attendance frequencies. The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.

    The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.

    Key code snippets included:
    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            temp = b
            b = a % b
            a = temp
        return a

    def lcm(a, b):
        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

    def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):
        total_hours = N * 24
        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        return total_hours // lcm_value
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    Title: Linear Diophantine Equation
    Part: 1/2
    # Linear Diophantine Equation

    A Linear Diophantine Equation (in two variables) is an equation of the general form:

    $$ax + by = c$$

    where $a$, $b$, $c$ are given integers, and $x$, $y$ are unknown integers.

    In this article, we consider several classical problems on these equations:

    * finding one solution
    * finding all solutions
    * finding the number of solutions and the solutions themselves in a given interval
    * finding a solution with minimum value of $x + y$

    ## The degenerate case

    A degenerate case that need to be taken care of is when $a = b = 0$. It is easy to see that we either have no solutions or infinitely many solutions, depending on whether $c = 0$ or not. In the rest of this article, we will ignore this case.

    ## Analytic solution

    When $a \neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$, the equation $ax+by=c$ can be equivalently treated as either of the following:

    \begin{gather}
    ax \equiv c \pmod b,\newline
    by \equiv c \pmod a.
    \end{gather}

    Without loss of generality, assume that $b \neq 0$ and consider the first equation. When $a$ and $b$ are co-prime, the solution to it is given as

    $$x \equiv ca^{-1} \pmod b,$$

    where $a^{-1}$ is the [modular inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$ modulo $b$.

    When $a$ and $b$ are not co-prime, values of $ax$ modulo $b$ for all integer $x$ are divisible by $g=\gcd(a, b)$, so the solution only exists when $c$ is divisible by $g$. In this case, one of solutions can be found by reducing the equation by $g$:

    $$(a/g) x \equiv (c/g) \pmod{b/g}.$$

    By the definition of $g$, the numbers $a/g$ and $b/g$ are co-prime, so the solution is given explicitly as

    $$\begin{cases}
    x \equiv (c/g)(a/g)^{-1}\pmod{b/g},\\
    y = \frac{c-ax}{b}.
    \end{cases}$$

    ## Algorithmic solution

    To find one solution of the Diophantine equation with 2 unknowns, you can use the [Extended Euclidean algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md). First, assume that $a$ and $b$ are non-negative. When we apply Extended Euclidean algorithm for $a$ and $b$, we can find their greatest common divisor $g$ and 2 numbers $x_g$ and $y_g$ such that:

    $$a x_g + b y_g = g$$

    If $c$ is divisible by $g = \gcd(a, b)$, then the given Diophantine equation has a solution, otherwise it does not have any solution. The proof is straight-forward: a linear combination of two numbers is divisible by their common divisor.

    Now supposed that $c$ is divisible by $g$, then we have:

    $$a \cdot x_g \cdot \frac{c}{g} + b \cdot y_g \cdot \frac{c}{g} = c$$

    Therefore one of the solutions of the Diophantine equation is:

    $$x_0 = x_g \cdot \frac{c}{g},$$

    $$y_0 = y_g \cdot \frac{c}{g}.$$

    The above idea still works when $a$ or $b$ or both of them are negative. We only need to change the sign of $x_0$ and $y_0$ when necessary.

    Finally, we can implement this idea as follows (note that this code does not consider the case $a = b = 0$):

    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_any}
    int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {
        if (b == 0) {
            x = 1;
            y = 0;
            return a;
        }
        int x1, y1;
        int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);
        x = y1;
        y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);
        return d;
    }

    bool find_any_solution(int a, int b, int c, int &x0, int &y0, int &g) {
        g = gcd(abs(a), abs(b), x0, y0);
        if (c % g) {
            return false;
        }

        x0 *= c / g;
        y0 *= c / g;
        if (a < 0) x0 = -x0;
        if (b < 0) y0 = -y0;
        return true;
    }
    ```

    ## Getting all solutions

    From one solution $(x_0, y_0)$, we can obtain all the solutions of the given equation.

    Let $g = \gcd(a, b)$ and let $x_0, y_0$ be integers which satisfy the following:

    $$a \cdot x_0 + b \cdot y_0 = c$$

    Now, we should see that adding $b / g$ to $x_0$, and, at the same time subtracting $a / g$ from $y_0$ will not break the equality:

    $$a \cdot \left(x_0 + \frac{b}{g}\right) + b \cdot \left(y_0 - \frac{a}{g}\right) = a \cdot x_0 + b \cdot y_0 + a \cdot \frac{b}{g} - b \cdot \frac{a}{g} = c$$

    Obviously, this process can be repeated again, so all the numbers of the form:

    $$x = x_0 + k \cdot \frac{b}{g}$$

    $$y = y_0 - k \cdot \frac{a}{g}$$

    are solutions of the given Diophantine equation.

    Moreover, this is the set of all possible solutions of the given Diophantine equation.

    ## Finding the number of solutions and the solutions in a given interval

    From previous section, it should be clear that if we don't impose any restrictions on the solutions, there would be infinite number of them. So in this section, we add some restrictions on the interval of $x$ and $y$, and we will try to count and enumerate all the solutions.

    Let there be two intervals: $[min_x; max_x]$ and $[min_y; max_y]$ and let's say we only want to find the solutions in these two intervals.

    Note that if $a$ or $b$ is $0$, then the problem only has one solution. We don't consider this case here.

    First, we can find a solution which have minimum value of $x$, such that $x \ge min_x$. To do this, we first find any solution of the Diophantine equation. Then, we shift this solution to get $x \ge min_x$ (using what we know about the set of all solutions in previous section). This can be done in $O(1)$.
    Denote this minimum value of $x$ by $l_{x1}$.

    Similarly, we can find the maximum value of $x$ which satisfy $x \le max_x$. Denote this maximum value of $x$ by $r_{x1}$.

    Similarly, we can find the minimum value of $y$ $(y \ge min_y)$ and maximum values of $y$ $(y \le max_y)$. Denote the corresponding values of $x$ by $l_{x2}$ and $r_{x2}$.

    The final solution is all solutions with x in intersection of $[l_{x1}, r_{x1}]$ and $[l_{x2}, r_{x2}]$. Let denote this intersection by $[l_x, r_x]$.

    Following is the code implementing this idea.
    Notice that we divide $a$ and $b$ at the beginning by $g$.
    Since the equation $a x + b y = c$ is equivalent to the equation $\frac{a}{g} x + \frac{b}{g} y = \frac{c}{g}$, we can use this one instead and have $\gcd(\frac{a}{g}, \frac{b}{g}) = 1$, which simplifies the formulas.

    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_all}
    void shift_solution(int & x, int & y, int a, int b, int cnt) {
        x += cnt * b;

   We have two jugs with specific capacities (x and y liters) and we want to find out if we can measure exactly z liters of water using these jugs. We can fill the jugs, empty them, or pour water from one jug to another. The goal is to determine if it's possible to have exactly z liters in one or both jugs.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if we can measure z liters, we can use the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD). The key insight is that we can measure z liters if and only if z is less than or equal to the total capacity of the jugs (x + y) and z is a multiple of the GCD of x and y. This is because any amount of water we can measure using the jugs must be a linear combination of the capacities of the jugs.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 364 [generation text] The problem involves determining if it's possible to measure exactly z liters using two jugs with capacities x and y. The key insight is that the solution relies on the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD). Specifically, we can measure z liters if z is less than or equal to the total capacity of the jugs (x + y) and if z is a multiple of the GCD of x and y.

The approach I took was to first check if z exceeds the combined capacity of the jugs. If it does, the answer is immediately false. Then, I implemented a helper function to compute the GCD of the two jug capacities. Finally, I checked if z is a multiple of this GCD to determine if the measurement is possible.

The final code implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without any issues. The solution effectively captures the mathematical properties needed to solve the problem efficiently. 

Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def canMeasureWater(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> bool:
        if z > x + y:
            return False
        
        def gcd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
            while b != 0:
                a, b = b, a % b
            return a
        
        return z % gcd(x, y) == 0
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties in problem-solving, particularly in optimization and combinatorial problems.

INFO - [Task id] 364 [generation text] The official solution provides a more nuanced approach to the problem of measuring water with two jugs. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:

1. **Initial Jug Order**: The solution begins by ensuring that `x` is the smaller jug. This simplifies the logic since we can always assume the smaller jug is `x` and the larger is `y`.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: It checks if `z` is negative or exceeds the total capacity of both jugs (`x + y`). This is a crucial step to quickly eliminate impossible cases.

3. **Special Cases**: The solution handles special cases where one of the jugs is empty. If `x` is zero, it checks if `z` is equal to `y` or zero, which is a straightforward condition.

4. **GCD Logic**: The solution employs a method to find the GCD of the two jug capacities. It uses a while loop to iteratively reduce the values, which is an efficient way to compute the GCD. The final check is whether `z` is a multiple of this GCD.

5. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It avoids unnecessary calculations by quickly ruling out impossible scenarios and directly leveraging the properties of GCD.

Overall, the official solution is insightful in its handling of edge cases and its efficient computation of the GCD, which is central to determining if `z` can be measured. My initial solution was correct but could have benefited from these additional checks and optimizations.

    Example 1: (From the famous "Die Hard" example)

    Input: x = 3, y = 5, z = 4
    Output: True



    Example 2:

    Input: x = 2, y = 6, z = 5
    Output: False
