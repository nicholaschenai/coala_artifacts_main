    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The task is to determine if a given arrangement of beds in a hospital area is safe or unsafe. The area is represented as a square grid where '1' indicates a bed is present and '0' indicates no bed. The beds must not be adjacent to each other, meaning no two '1's can be next to each other horizontally or vertically. However, beds can be placed diagonally next to each other without issue. If any two adjacent blocks contain beds, the arrangement is deemed \"UNSAFE\"; otherwise, it is \"SAFE\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   We will read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the size of the grid and the grid itself. We will then check each cell in the grid. For each '1' found, we will check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to see if they also contain '1'. If we find any adjacent '1's, we will mark the arrangement as \"UNSAFE\". If we finish checking the entire grid without finding any adjacent '1's, we will mark it as \"SAFE\".\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_safe_area(grid):\n       for each row in grid:\n           for each column in row:\n               if grid[row][column] == 1:\n                   if (row > 0 and grid[row-1][column] == 1) or\n                      (row < N-1 and grid[row+1][column] == 1) or\n                      (column > 0 and grid[row][column-1] == 1) or\n                      (column < N-1 and grid[row][column+1] == 1):\n                       return \"UNSAFE\"\n       return \"SAFE\"\n\n   function solve():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           initialize grid\n           for each row in grid:\n               read row data\n           result = is_safe_area(grid)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_safe_area(grid):\n    # Check each cell in the grid\n    N = len(grid)\n    for row in range(N):\n        for column in range(N):\n            # If we find a bed\n            if grid[row][column] == 1:\n                # Check adjacent cells\n                if (row > 0 and grid[row-1][column] == 1) or \\\n                   (row < N-1 and grid[row+1][column] == 1) or \\\n                   (column > 0 and grid[row][column-1] == 1) or \\\n                   (column < N-1 and grid[row][column+1] == 1):\n                    return \"UNSAFE\"  # Found adjacent beds\n    return \"SAFE\"  # No adjacent beds found\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    index = 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])  # Read size of the grid\n        index += 1\n        grid = []\n        \n        # Read the grid\n        for _ in range(N):\n            row = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n            grid.append(row)\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Check if the arrangement is safe\n        result = is_safe_area(grid)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the code\nsolve()\n```",
