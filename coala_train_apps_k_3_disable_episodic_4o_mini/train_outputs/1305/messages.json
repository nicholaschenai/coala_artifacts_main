The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.\nThe area is of dimension $N$ x $N$\nThe whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.\nThis is a SAFE example:\n1 0\n0 1\nThis is an UNSAFE example:\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n1 0 0\nTo avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.\nReturn an output of \"SAFE\" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return \"UNSAFE\" otherwise.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

The beds must not be adjacent to each other, meaning no two beds can be in horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent blocks.

The challenge involved ensuring that tiles from a single box were used to tile two rooms, one in each house, and that the total area of the rooms matched the number of tiles.\n\n    The core concept revolved around checking pairs of rooms to see if their combined area equaled the number of tiles in an even-indexed box. The solution involved iterating through all boxes and checking all possible pairs of rooms, which could be computationally expensive given the constraints (up to \\(10^{12}\\) for N). \n\n    The initial approach was to use nested loops to check each box and room combination, but this would not scale well for large values of N. However, the provided solution worked correctly for smaller inputs, as evidenced by passing the sample test case.\n\n    In future implementations, a more efficient algorithm would be necessary to handle larger values of N, possibly by leveraging mathematical properties of perfect squares or optimizing the search for room pairs. The final code snippet that worked for the sample input is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(N):\n        total_rooms = 0\n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                for j1 in range(1, N + 1):\n                    for j2 in range(1, N + 1):\n                        if j1 != j2 and j1 * j1 + j2 * j2 == i:\n                            total_rooms += 2\n                            break\n        return total_rooms\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary highlights the problem-solving approach, the challenges faced, and the need for optimization in future attempts.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof at the origin (0, 0) based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). \n\n    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.\n\n    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum. The approach was straightforward and worked well within the constraints provided. \n\n    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently handling input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. The solution utilized a linear search for counting walls, which was acceptable given the constraints, but could be optimized further with binary search if necessary. Overall, the solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls\n            index += 1\n        \n            walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions\n            index += 1\n        \n            Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                x_j, y_j = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read query coordinates\n                index += 1\n            \n                sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                # Check if the point lies on any wall\n                if sum_xy in walls:\n                    results.append(-1)\n                else:\n                    # Count how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                    count = 0\n                    for wall in walls:\n                        if wall > sum_xy:\n                            count += 1\n                    results.append(count)\n    \n        # Print all results for all queries\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    # Call the solve function to execute the code\n    solve()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies employed, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of alternating '1's and '0's based on an integer input \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. The pattern required printing \\( K \\) lines for each test case, where each line \\( i \\) contains \\( i \\) characters.\n\n    The solution involved iterating through each test case and constructing the required lines by checking the index of each character to determine whether to append '1' or '0'. The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided.\n\n    One key aspect was ensuring that the output format matched the expected results, which involved printing each line immediately after constructing it.

        "content": "The official solution effectively checks for adjacent beds in a grid by iterating through the rows and columns. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of test cases and initializes a list to store results. It then reads the grid for each test case into a list of lists.\n\n2. **Row Check**: The first nested loop checks each row for adjacent beds by comparing each element with the next one in the same row. If two adjacent '1's are found, it marks the arrangement as \"UNSAFE\" and breaks out of the loop.\n\n3. **Column Check**: The second nested loop checks for adjacent beds vertically by comparing each element in a row with the one directly below it. Again, if two adjacent '1's are found, it marks the arrangement as \"UNSAFE\".\n\n4. **Final Result**: If no adjacent beds are found after checking both rows and columns, it appends \"SAFE\" to the results list.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- The official solution is straightforward and efficient, using a simple flag mechanism to break out of loops early when an unsafe condition is detected.\n- It effectively separates the checks for rows and columns, making the logic clear and easy to follow.\n- The approach ensures that the solution runs in linear time relative to the number of cells in the grid, which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\n### Reflection:\nMy initial solution was similar in logic but could have been more concise. The official solution's separation of row and column checks simplifies the understanding of the problem. Additionally, using a flag to control the flow of checks is a good practice to avoid unnecessary iterations once a condition is met. This experience highlights the importance of clarity and efficiency in problem-solving."

        "content": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThis function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid representing the arrangement of beds. It processes each grid to determine if any beds are adjacent to each other, which would make the area unsafe. For each test case, it constructs the grid from the input and then checks its safety using a specific method. The results for all test cases are collected and printed sequentially. The function handles the input and output but does not perform any safety checks itself. It serves as the main execution point for the program.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where social distancing is critical, such as during a pandemic or in crowded environments. It can be applied in hospital bed arrangements, event seating plans, or any situation where maintaining a safe distance between individuals is necessary to prevent the spread of disease. Additionally, this logic can be adapted for various grid-based problems in computer science, such as game development or resource allocation in constrained spaces."
