## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to check if a given arrangement of beds in a square area is safe. The area is represented as a grid of 1s and 0s, where 1 indicates a bed is present and 0 indicates it is not. The beds must not be adjacent to each other, meaning no two beds can be in horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent blocks. If any two beds are adjacent, we will classify the arrangement as "UNSAFE"; otherwise, it will be "SAFE".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We will iterate through each test case and for each grid, we will check every cell. If we find a bed (1), we will check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals) to see if any of them also contain a bed. If we find any adjacent beds, we will mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE". If we finish checking the entire grid without finding any adjacent beds, we will mark it as "SAFE".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function check_beds_safety(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N

               read the row values

                       if any adjacent cell is also 1:

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many rooms in two houses could be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where each box contained a number of tiles equal to its index. The challenge involved ensuring that tiles from a single box were used to tile two rooms, one in each house, and that the total area of the rooms matched the number of tiles.

    The core concept revolved around checking pairs of rooms to see if their combined area equaled the number of tiles in an even-indexed box. The solution involved iterating through all boxes and checking all possible pairs of rooms, which could be computationally expensive given the constraints (up to \(10^{12}\) for N). 

    The initial approach was to use nested loops to check each box and room combination, but this would not scale well for large values of N. However, the provided solution worked correctly for smaller inputs, as evidenced by passing the sample test case.

    In future implementations, a more efficient algorithm would be necessary to handle larger values of N, possibly by leveraging mathematical properties of perfect squares or optimizing the search for room pairs. The final code snippet that worked for the sample input is as follows:

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(N):
        total_rooms = 0
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                for j1 in range(1, N + 1):
                    for j2 in range(1, N + 1):
                        if j1 != j2 and j1 * j1 + j2 * j2 == i:
                            total_rooms += 2
                            break
        return total_rooms

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    ```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof at the origin (0, 0) based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). 

    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.

    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum. The approach was straightforward and worked well within the constraints provided. 

    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently handling input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. The solution utilized a linear search for counting walls, which was acceptable given the constraints, but could be optimized further with binary search if necessary. Overall, the solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls
            index += 1
        
            walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions
            index += 1
        
            Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                x_j, y_j = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read query coordinates
                index += 1
            
                sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
                # Check if the point lies on any wall
                if sum_xy in walls:
                    results.append(-1)
                else:
                    # Count how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                    count = 0
                    for wall in walls:
                        if wall > sum_xy:
                            count += 1
                    results.append(count)

        for res in results:
            print(res)

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of alternating '1's and '0's based on an integer input \( K \) for multiple test cases. The pattern required printing \( K \) lines for each test case, where each line \( i \) contains \( i \) characters.

    The solution involved iterating through each test case and constructing the required lines by checking the index of each character to determine whether to append '1' or '0'. The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided.

    One key aspect was ensuring that the output format matched the expected results, which involved printing each line immediately after constructing it. The solution was efficient and adhered to the problem's requirements without any external libraries.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
        for K in test_cases:
            for i in range(1, K + 1):
                line = ""
                for j in range(i):
                    if j % 2 == 0:
                        line += "1"
                    else:
                        line += "0"
                print(line)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]
    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing output formatting and the utility of nested loops for generating patterns based on incremental conditions.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a given arrangement of beds in a hospital area is safe or unsafe. The area is represented as a square grid where '1' indicates a bed is present and '0' indicates no bed. The beds must not be adjacent to each other, meaning no two '1's can be next to each other horizontally or vertically. However, beds can be placed diagonally next to each other without issue. If any two adjacent blocks contain beds, the arrangement is deemed "UNSAFE"; otherwise, it is "SAFE".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We will read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the size of the grid and the grid itself. We will then check each cell in the grid. For each '1' found, we will check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to see if they also contain '1'. If we find any adjacent '1's, we will mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE". If we finish checking the entire grid without finding any adjacent '1's, we will mark it as "SAFE".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function is_safe_area(grid):
       for each row in grid:
           for each column in row:
               if grid[row][column] == 1:
                   if (row > 0 and grid[row-1][column] == 1) or
                      (row < N-1 and grid[row+1][column] == 1) or

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a given arrangement of beds in a hospital area is safe or unsafe. The area is represented as a square grid where '1' indicates a bed is present and '0' indicates no bed. The beds must not be adjacent to each other, meaning no two '1's can be next to each other horizontally or vertically. However, beds can be placed diagonally next to each other without issue. If any two adjacent blocks contain beds, the arrangement is deemed "UNSAFE"; otherwise, it is "SAFE".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We will read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the size of the grid and the grid itself. We will then check each cell in the grid. For each '1' found, we will check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to see if they also contain '1'. If we find any adjacent '1's, we will mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE". If we finish checking the entire grid without finding any adjacent '1's, we will mark it as "SAFE".

- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
This is a SAFE example:
1 0
0 1
This is an UNSAFE example:
0 1 1
0 0 0
1 0 0
To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Next line contains $N$.
- Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

-----Output:-----
For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
- 70 points : Original constraints

0 0 0 1
0 1 0 0
1 0 0 1

1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 1
0 1 0 0

-----Sample Output:-----
SAFE
UNSAFE

-----EXPLANATION:-----
Beds placed on blocks diagonally are not a problem.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] The problem involved determining if a grid arrangement of beds in a hospital was "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on the adjacency of beds represented by '1's in a square grid. The key concept was to check for adjacent '1's in the grid, while allowing diagonal placements to be safe.

The solution was structured into two main functions: `is_safe_area` to check the grid for adjacent beds, and `solve` to handle input and output. The adjacency check involved iterating through each cell and checking its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) for '1's. If any adjacent '1's were found, the arrangement was marked as "UNSAFE".

The implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The core strategy of checking adjacent cells was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during the process. This experience reinforced the importance of careful adjacency checks in grid-based problems. 

Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

```python

    N = len(grid)

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a given arrangement of beds in a hospital area is safe or unsafe. The area is represented as a square grid where '1' indicates a bed is present and '0' indicates no bed. The beds must not be adjacent to each other, meaning no two '1's can be next to each other horizontally or vertically. However, beds can be placed diagonally next to each other without issue. If any two adjacent blocks contain beds, the arrangement is deemed "UNSAFE"; otherwise, it is "SAFE".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We will read the number of test cases and for each test case, read the size of the grid and the grid itself. We will then check each cell in the grid. For each '1' found, we will check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to see if they also contain '1'. If we find any adjacent '1's, we will mark the arrangement as "UNSAFE". If we finish checking the entire grid without finding any adjacent '1's, we will mark it as "SAFE".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function is_safe_area(grid):
       for each row in grid:
           for each column in row:
               if grid[row][column] == 1:
                   if (row > 0 and grid[row-1][column] == 1) or
                      (row < N-1 and grid[row+1][column] == 1) or
                      (column > 0 and grid[row][column-1] == 1) or
                      (column < N-1 and grid[row][column+1] == 1):
                       return "UNSAFE"
       return "SAFE"

   function solve():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N
           initialize grid
           for each row in grid:
               read row data
           result = is_safe_area(grid)
           print result
   ```

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] The official solution effectively checks for adjacent beds in a grid by iterating through the rows and columns. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of test cases and initializes a list to store results. It then reads the grid for each test case into a list of lists.

2. **Row Check**: The first nested loop checks each row for adjacent beds by comparing each element with the next one in the same row. If two adjacent '1's are found, it marks the arrangement as "UNSAFE" and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Column Check**: The second nested loop checks for adjacent beds vertically by comparing each element in a row with the one directly below it. Again, if two adjacent '1's are found, it marks the arrangement as "UNSAFE".

4. **Final Result**: If no adjacent beds are found after checking both rows and columns, it appends "SAFE" to the results list.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Key Takeaways:
- The official solution is straightforward and efficient, using a simple flag mechanism to break out of loops early when an unsafe condition is detected.
- It effectively separates the checks for rows and columns, making the logic clear and easy to follow.
- The approach ensures that the solution runs in linear time relative to the number of cells in the grid, which is optimal for the given constraints.

### Reflection:
My initial solution was similar in logic but could have been more concise. The official solution's separation of row and column checks simplifies the understanding of the problem. Additionally, using a flag to control the flow of checks is a good practice to avoid unnecessary iterations once a condition is met. This experience highlights the importance of clarity and efficiency in problem-solving.
INFO - Updated entry: The problem involved determining if a grid arrangement of beds in a hospital was "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on the adjacency of beds represented by '1's in a square grid. The key concept was to check for adjacent '1's in the grid, while allowing diagonal placements to be safe.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 1305 [generation text] This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a grid representing the arrangement of beds. It processes each grid to determine if any beds are adjacent to each other, which would make the area unsafe. For each test case, it constructs the grid from the input and then checks its safety using a specific method. The results for all test cases are collected and printed sequentially. The function handles the input and output but does not perform any safety checks itself. It serves as the main execution point for the program.

[Problem]
    Due to the COVID pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of cases if a hospital. The management has decided to clear a large square area for the patients and arrange for beds. But the beds can't be too near to each other.
    The area is of dimension $N$ x $N$
    The whole area is already divided into blocks. $1$ means there's a bed in the block, $0$ denotes there isn't. Note, beds placed on consecutive diagonal blocks are safe.
    This is a SAFE example:
    1 0
    0 1
    This is an UNSAFE example:
    0 1 1
    0 0 0
    1 0 0
    To avoid spreading the virus even further, you have to make sure no two adjacent blocks have beds in them. This is done to maintain distance between beds.
    Return an output of "SAFE" if you find the workers have arranged the beds with due consideration to the distance needed. Return "UNSAFE" otherwise.

    -----Input:-----
    - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
    - Next line contains $N$.
    - Next $N$ lines will contain $N$ number of space-separated integers $Ai$ which make denote the beds in the area.

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, output in a single line whether the total arrangement is "SAFE" or "UNSAFE". Even if there's a single unsafe bed in the whole area, report the whole area as "UNSAFE".

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
    - $0 \leq Ai \leq 1$
    - $2 \leq N \leq 100$

    -----Subtasks-----
    - 30 points : $1 \leq N \leq 7$
    - 70 points : Original constraints
