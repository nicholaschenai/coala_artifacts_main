    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**:\n   The problem involves determining how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof, who is located at the origin (0, 0). Each wall is represented by a line segment connecting points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). For each query, which gives Chef's starting coordinates (x_j, y_j), we need to check if Chef is on a wall, and if not, count how many walls he would need to break to reach the origin.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:\n   - First, we need to read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, read the number of walls and their respective positions.\n   - For each query, check if the point (x_j, y_j) lies on any wall. A point lies on the wall if x_j + y_j equals a_i for any wall.\n   - If the point is not on a wall, count how many walls have a_i greater than x_j + y_j, as these are the walls Chef would need to break through to reach the origin.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function solve():\n       read T  // number of test cases\n       for each test case:\n           read N  // number of walls\n           read a_i  // list of wall positions\n           read Q  // number of queries\n           for each query:\n               read x_j, y_j\n               sum = x_j + y_j\n               if sum is in a_i:\n                   print -1\n               else:\n                   count = 0\n                   for each wall in a_i:\n                       if wall > sum:\n                           count += 1\n                   print count\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls\n        index += 1\n        \n        walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions\n        index += 1\n        \n        Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries\n        index += 1\n        \n        for __ in range(Q):\n            x_j, y_j = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read query coordinates\n            index += 1\n            \n            sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n            # Check if the point lies on any wall\n            if sum_xy in walls:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                # Count how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                count = 0\n                for wall in walls:\n                    if wall > sum_xy:\n                        count += 1\n                results.append(count)\n    \n    # Print all results for all queries\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the code\nsolve()\n``` \n\nThis solution efficiently processes the input and computes the required outputs based on the conditions specified in the problem statement. Each query is handled in linear time relative to the number of walls, ensuring that the solution remains efficient within the given constraints.",
