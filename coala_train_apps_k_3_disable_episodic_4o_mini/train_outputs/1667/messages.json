The depth is the number of runs, you have to do.\n- In every run you have to switch the direction. First run from left, next run from right. Next left...\nEvery run has these rules:\n- You start at the first number (from the direction).\n- Take for every number x the remainder of the division by the number of still available elements (from \n  this position!) to have the number for the next decision.\n- If the remainder-value is smaller than 3, take this number x (NOT the remainder-Value) direct\n  for the new array and continue with the next number.\n- If the remainder-value (e.g. 3) is greater than 2, take the next remainder-value-number (e.g. 3)\n  elements/numbers (inclusive the number x, NOT the remainder-value) as a sub-array in the new array.\n  Continue with the next number/element AFTER this taken elements/numbers.\n- Every sub-array in the array is independent and is only one element for the progress on the array. \n  For every sub-array you have to follow the same rules for unflatten it.\n  The direction is always the same as the actual run.\n```\n\nSounds complicated? Yeah, thats why, this is the harder version...\nMaybe an example will help.\n\n```\n Array: [4, 5, 1, 7, 1] Depth: 2 -> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n \nSteps: \nFirst run: (start from left side!)\n1. The first number is 4. The number is smaller than the number of remaining elements, so it is the remainder-value (4 / 5 -> remainder 4).\n   So 4 numbers (4, 5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the new array.\n2. The next number is 1. It is smaller than 3, so the 1 is added direct to the new array.\nNow we have --> [[4, 5, 1, 7], 1]\n\nSecond run: (start from right side!)\n1. The last number (first from other side) is 1. So the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n2. The next element is the sub-array. So we use the rules for this.\n2a.The last number is 7. There are 4 elements in the array. So for the next decision you have to\n   take the remainder from 7 / 4 -> 3. So 3 numbers (5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the \n   new array.\n2b.Now there is the 4 and only one element last in this array. 4 / 1 -> remainder 0. It is smaller\n   than 3. So the 4 is added direct to the new array.\nNow we have --> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n```\n\nThe given array will always contain numbers. There will only be numbers > 0.\n\n\nHave fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\nI have created other katas.

This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values.

The key operations involved were determining the final hill index after a series of jumps and updating the heights of a range of hills.\n\n    The core concepts tested included:\n    - Efficiently finding the nearest higher hill within a limited range (100 hills).\n    - Handling multiple operations on an array of heights, including both read and update operations.\n\n    The solution utilized a straightforward approach where for each jump, I iterated through the hills to the right of the current position to find the next valid hill. This was done in a while loop, which continued until the maximum number of jumps was reached or no valid hill was found. The height updates were handled with a simple loop over the specified range.\n\n    The implementation was successful, passing all provided test cases, indicating that the logic for both types of operations was correctly executed. The final code efficiently managed the operations within the constraints, demonstrating a clear understanding of array manipulation and iteration in Python. \n\n    Key code snippet for the jump operation:\n    ```python\n    while jumps < k:\n        next_index = current_index + 1\n        found = False\n        while next_index < N and next_index <= current_index + 100:\n            if A[next_index] > A[current_index]:\n                current_index = next_index\n                found = True\n                break\n            next_index += 1\n        if not found:\n            break\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing indices and conditions when working with array-based problems, especially in competitive programming contexts.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to calculate the mean of maximum scores for students based on the complexity of questions assigned to them. Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The challenge involved efficiently updating scores for potentially large numbers of students and questions.\n\n    The core concept tested was the ability to manipulate an array of scores based on given ranges and multipliers. The solution involved initializing an array of scores, iterating through the questions, and updating the scores for the specified range of students. After processing all questions, the mean score was calculated using integer division to ensure the floor value was returned.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints, as it directly updated scores in a single pass for each question. The final code successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the approach was sound. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    for question in test_case[1]:\n        i, j, k = question\n        for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Adjust for 0-based index\n            scores[student] *= k  # Update scores based on complexity\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding how to efficiently manipulate data structures and perform calculations based on specified conditions.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.\n\n1. **Understanding the Requirements:**\n   - The function needs to unflatten a list based on specific rules, alternating the direction of processing for each depth level.\n   - The output should be a nested structure where sub-arrays are created based on the rules provided.\n\n2. **Identifying the Mistake:**\n   - In the original implementation, when the remainder is greater than or equal to 3, the code correctly identifies that a sub-array should be created. However, it does not correctly handle the direction switching and the recursive unflattening of the sub-array.\n   - The direction switching logic was not implemented correctly. The direction should change after each complete run (left to right or right to left), but the current implementation does not account for this properly.\n\n3. **Specific Issues:**\n   - The code does not correctly handle the case where a sub-array is created. It should ensure that the next number processed is the one immediately after the sub-array, but the current implementation may not be doing this correctly.\n   - The output structure is not matching the expected output format, particularly in how sub-arrays are nested.\n\n4. **Plan for Correction:**\n   - We need to ensure that when we create a sub-array, we correctly skip over the elements that are included in that sub-array.\n   - We should also ensure that the direction is correctly toggled after each complete run through the list.\n   - The recursive call to `unflatten` should be made with the correct sub-array and depth.\n\nNow, let's revise the code to address these issues:\n\n```python\ndef unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n    # Base case: if depth is 0, return the flat array as is\n    if depth == 0:\n        return flat_array\n    \n    new_array = []  # This will hold the unflattened result\n    direction = 1  # Start with left to right\n    index = 0  # Starting index for left to right\n    \n    while index < len(flat_array):  # Process until we reach the end of the array\n        current_number = flat_array[index]  # Get the current number\n        remaining_elements = len(flat_array) - index  # Count remaining elements\n        remainder = current_number % remaining_elements  # Calculate the remainder\n        \n        if remainder < 3:  # If remainder is less than 3\n            new_array.append(current_number)  # Add the number directly to the new array\n            index += 1  # Move to the next number\n        else:  # If remainder is 3 or more\n            sub_array = flat_array[index:index + remainder]  # Take the next 'remainder' elements\n            new_array.append(unflatten(sub_array, depth - 1))  # Recursively unflatten the sub-array\n            index += remainder  # Move the index forward by the size of the sub-array\n        \n        # Switch direction for the next run\n        direction *= -1  # Change direction for the next run\n    \n    return new_array  # Return the newly constructed array\n```\n\n### Revised Plan:\n1. **Direction Handling:** Ensure that the direction is toggled correctly after each complete run.\n2. **Sub-array Handling:** When creating a sub-array, ensure that the next index is correctly set to the element immediately after the sub-array.\n3. **Output Structure:** Ensure that the output matches the expected nested structure.\n\nNow, let's implement these changes in the code."

The main challenge was ensuring that the jump validity checks were correctly implemented, particularly the requirement that all intermediate values between the starting and destination indices must be less than the value at the starting index.\n\n    Initially, the code failed to account for all valid paths due to incorrect jump validity checks and an inefficient counting mechanism. The use of a visited set was appropriate to prevent revisiting indices, but it led to missed paths when not managed correctly.\n\n    The successful strategy involved implementing memoization to store results for previously computed indices, which significantly improved efficiency and ensured that all valid paths were explored. The final implementation correctly checks both left and right jumps within the allowed distance and verifies that all intermediate values meet the required conditions.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:\n            memo = {}\n        \n            def dfs(index):\n                if index in memo:\n                    return memo[index]\n            \n                max_count = 1\n            \n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index + x < len(arr) and arr[index] > arr[index + x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))\n            \n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index - x >= 0 and arr[index] > arr[index - x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x))\n            \n                memo[index] = max_count\n                return max_count\n\n            max_jumps = 0\n            for index in range(len(arr)):\n                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index))\n            return max_jumps\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing state in recursive functions and the benefits of memoization in optimizing performance.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

After processing the entire array in one direction, the index should not just be reset to the end or the beginning; it should also consider the elements that have already been processed.\n\n3. **Specific Issues:**\n   - The direction switching logic is not correctly implemented. The index should be adjusted based on the direction and the elements processed in the previous run.\n   - The recursive call to `unflatten` should be made with the correct sub-array and depth, but the current implementation may not be managing the index correctly after processing sub-arrays.\n\n4. **Plan for Correction:**\n   - We need to ensure that when we create a sub-array, we correctly skip over the elements that are included in that sub-array.\n   - We should also ensure that the direction is correctly toggled after each complete run, and the index is set to the correct position based on the direction.\n\nNow, let's revise the code to address these issues:\n\n```python\ndef unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n    # Base case: if depth is 0, return the flat array as is\n    if depth == 0:\n        return flat_array\n    \n    new_array = []  # This will hold the unflattened result\n    direction = 1  # Start with left to right\n    index = 0  # Starting index for left to right\n    \n    while index < len(flat_array):  # Process until we reach the end of the array\n        current_number = flat_array[index]  # Get the current number\n        remaining_elements = len(flat_array) - index  # Count remaining elements\n        remainder = current_number % remaining_elements  # Calculate the remainder\n        \n        if remainder < 3:  # If remainder is less than 3\n            new_array.append(current_number)  # Add the number directly to the new array\n            index += 1  # Move to the next number\n        else:  # If remainder is 3 or more\n            sub_array = flat_array[index:index + remainder]  # Take the next 'remainder' elements\n            new_array.append(unflatten(sub_array, depth - 1))  # Recursively unflatten the sub-array\n            index += remainder  # Move the index forward by the size of the sub-array\n        \n        # After processing the entire array in one direction, switch direction\n        if direction == 1:  # If we were going left to right\n            direction = -1  # Switch to right to left\n            # Set index to the last processed element for the next run\n            index = len(flat_array) - 1  # Start from the end for the next run\n        else:  # If we were going right to left\n            direction = 1  # Switch to left to right\n            # Set index to the first processed element for the next run\n            index = 0  # Start from the beginning for the next run\n    \n    return new_array  # Return the newly constructed array\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n1. **Direction Handling:** The direction is now toggled after processing the entire array in one direction.

The key operations involved were determining the final hill index after a series of jumps and updating the heights of a range of hills.\n\n    The core concepts tested included:\n    - Efficiently finding the nearest higher hill within a limited range (100 hills).\n    - Handling multiple operations on an array of heights, including both read and update operations.\n\n    The solution utilized a straightforward approach where for each jump, I iterated through the hills to the right of the current position to find the next valid hill. This was done in a while loop, which continued until the maximum number of jumps was reached or no valid hill was found. The height updates were handled with a simple loop over the specified range.\n\n    The implementation was successful, passing all provided test cases, indicating that the logic for both types of operations was correctly executed. The final code efficiently managed the operations within the constraints, demonstrating a clear understanding of array manipulation and iteration in Python. \n\n    Key code snippet for the jump operation:\n    ```python\n    while jumps < k:\n        next_index = current_index + 1\n        found = False\n        while next_index < N and next_index <= current_index + 100:\n            if A[next_index] > A[current_index]:\n                current_index = next_index\n                found = True\n                break\n            next_index += 1\n        if not found:\n            break\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing indices and conditions when working with array-based problems, especially in competitive programming contexts.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of finding the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array by jumping according to specific rules, I initially implemented a depth-first search (DFS) approach.

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.\n\n    2. **Data Structure**: It uses a dictionary (`scores`) to map the difficulty score (n) to a list of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping of problems with the same difficulty.\n\n    3. **Pairing and Sorting**: For each problem, the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask are paired using a dictionary. The scores are then sorted, which simplifies the comparison of contestant numbers.\n\n    4. **Counting Decreases**: The solution counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases as it moves through the sorted scores. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent elements.\n\n    5. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores for all problems, the solution sorts the unique difficulty scores and then sorts the problem indices for each score before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the required order.\n\n    6. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.\n\n    In contrast to my initial approach, the official solution is more concise and leverages Python's built-in data structures effectively. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly mapping scores to problem indices, which simplifies the sorting and output process. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can simplify grouping and sorting tasks in programming challenges.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The index should be adjusted based on the direction and the elements processed in the previous run.\n   - The recursive call to `unflatten` should be made with the correct sub-array and depth, but the current implementation may not be managing the index correctly after processing sub-arrays.\n\n4. **Plan for Correction:**\n   - We need to ensure that when we create a sub-array, we correctly skip over the elements that are included in that sub-array.\n   - We should also ensure that the direction is correctly toggled after each complete run, and the index is set to the correct position based on the direction.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. **Direction Handling:** We will maintain a flag to indicate the current direction and adjust the index accordingly after each run.\n2. **Sub-array Handling:** When we encounter a sub-array, we will ensure that we correctly skip over the elements that are included in that sub-array.\n3. **Recursive Calls:** We will ensure that the recursive calls are made correctly and that the depth is decremented appropriately.\n\nNow, let's implement these changes in the code:\n\n```python\ndef unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n    # Base case: if depth is 0, return the flat array as is\n    if depth == 0:\n        return flat_array\n    \n    new_array = []  # This will hold the unflattened result\n    direction = 1  # Start with left to right\n    index = 0  # Starting index for left to right\n    \n    while index < len(flat_array):  # Process until we reach the end of the array\n        current_number = flat_array[index]  # Get the current number\n        remaining_elements = len(flat_array) - index  # Count remaining elements\n        remainder = current_number % remaining_elements  # Calculate the remainder\n        \n        if remainder < 3:  # If remainder is less than 3\n            new_array.append(current_number)  # Add the number directly to the new array\n            index += 1  # Move to the next number\n        else:  # If remainder is 3 or more\n            sub_array = flat_array[index:index + remainder]  # Take the next 'remainder' elements\n            new_array.append(unflatten(sub_array, depth - 1))  # Recursively unflatten the sub-array\n            index += remainder  # Move the index forward by the size of the sub-array\n        \n        # After processing the entire array in one direction, switch direction\n        if direction == 1:  # If we were going left to right\n            direction = -1  # Switch to right to left\n            # Set index to the last processed element for the next run\n            index = len(flat_array) - 1  # Start from the end for the next run\n        else:  # If we were going right to left\n            direction = 1  # Switch to left to right\n            # Set index to the first processed element for the next run\n            index = 0  # Start from the beginning for the next run\n    \n    return new_array  # Return the newly constructed array\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n1. **Direction Handling:** The direction is now toggled after processing the entire array in one direction. The index is reset to the appropriate starting point for the next run.\n2. **Sub-array Handling:** The logic for handling sub-arrays remains the same, but the overall structure ensures that the output matches the expected nested format.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly handle the unflattening process according to the specified rules and pass all tests."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, I implemented a solution to handle a hill jumping competition where participants jump between hills based on their heights. The key operations involved were determining the final hill index after a series of jumps and updating the heights of a range of hills.\n\n    The core concepts tested included:\n    - Efficiently finding the nearest higher hill within a limited range (100 hills).\n    - Handling multiple operations on an array of heights, including both read and update operations.\n\n    The solution utilized a straightforward approach where for each jump, I iterated through the hills to the right of the current position to find the next valid hill. This was done in a while loop, which continued until the maximum number of jumps was reached or no valid hill was found. The height updates were handled with a simple loop over the specified range.\n\n    The implementation was successful, passing all provided test cases, indicating that the logic for both types of operations was correctly executed. The final code efficiently managed the operations within the constraints, demonstrating a clear understanding of array manipulation and iteration in Python. \n\n    Key code snippet for the jump operation:\n    ```python\n    while jumps < k:\n        next_index = current_index + 1\n        found = False\n        while next_index < N and next_index <= current_index + 100:\n            if A[next_index] > A[current_index]:\n                current_index = next_index\n                found = True\n                break\n            next_index += 1\n        if not found:\n            break\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing indices and conditions when working with array-based problems, especially in competitive programming contexts.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of finding the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array by jumping according to specific rules, I initially implemented a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The main challenge was ensuring that the jump validity checks were correctly implemented, particularly the requirement that all intermediate values between the starting and destination indices must be less than the value at the starting index.\n\n    Initially, the code failed to account for all valid paths due to incorrect jump validity checks and an inefficient counting mechanism. The use of a visited set was appropriate to prevent revisiting indices, but it led to missed paths when not managed correctly.\n\n    The successful strategy involved implementing memoization to store results for previously computed indices, which significantly improved efficiency and ensured that all valid paths were explored. The final implementation correctly checks both left and right jumps within the allowed distance and verifies that all intermediate values meet the required conditions.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:\n            memo = {}\n        \n            def dfs(index):\n                if index in memo:\n                    return memo[index]\n            \n                max_count = 1\n            \n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index + x < len(arr) and arr[index] > arr[index + x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))\n            \n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index - x >= 0 and arr[index] > arr[index - x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x))\n            \n                memo[index] = max_count\n                return max_count\n\n            max_jumps = 0\n            for index in range(len(arr)):\n                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index))\n            return max_jumps\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing state in recursive functions and the benefits of memoization in optimizing performance.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems based on their calculated difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.\n\n    2. **Data Structure**: It uses a dictionary (`scores`) to map the difficulty score (n) to a list of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping of problems with the same difficulty.\n\n    3. **Pairing and Sorting**: For each problem, the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask are paired using a dictionary. The scores are then sorted, which simplifies the comparison of contestant numbers.\n\n    4. **Counting Decreases**: The solution counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases as it moves through the sorted scores. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent elements.\n\n    5. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores for all problems, the solution sorts the unique difficulty scores and then sorts the problem indices for each score before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the required order.\n\n    6. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.\n\n    In contrast to my initial approach, the official solution is more concise and leverages Python's built-in data structures effectively. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly mapping scores to problem indices, which simplifies the sorting and output process. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can simplify grouping and sorting tasks in programming challenges.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Recursive Structure:** The function `unflatten` is defined as a lambda function that checks if the current depth (`c`) has reached the specified depth (`d`). If so, it returns the input array as is. Otherwise, it calls itself recursively, alternating the direction of processing based on the current depth.\n\n2. **Direction Handling:** The direction of processing (left to right or right to left) is managed using a binary flag (`lr`). This flag determines how the index is updated and how elements are processed.\n\n3. **Parsing Logic:** The `parse` function is responsible for iterating through the array. It uses a while loop to process elements based on the current direction:\n   - If the current element is a list, it recursively calls `parse` on that sub-list.\n   - If the current element is an integer, it calculates the number of elements to take based on the modulus operation. If the result is greater than or equal to 3, it takes a sub-array; otherwise, it adds the integer directly to the result.\n\n4. **Index Management:** The index is updated based on the number of elements taken or directly incremented by one, depending on the conditions. The use of list slicing and reversing ensures that the output maintains the correct order.\n\n5. **Final Output:** The final result is constructed by reversing the order of the output based on the last direction processed, ensuring that the output matches the expected nested structure.\n\n### Reflection:\nThe official solution is more elegant and efficient than my previous attempts. It effectively uses recursion and concise logic to handle the complexity of the problem without excessive state management. My approach struggled with direction handling and index management, leading to runtime errors and incorrect outputs. The official solution's use of a lambda function and helper function for parsing provides a clear separation of concerns and simplifies the overall logic. This experience highlights the importance of recursive thinking and careful index management in problems involving nested structures."
