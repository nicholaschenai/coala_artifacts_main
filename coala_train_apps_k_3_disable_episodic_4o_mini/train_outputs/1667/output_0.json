    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The task is to take a flat list of integers and \"unflatten\" it into a nested structure based on specific rules. The unflattening process involves multiple runs, alternating the direction of processing (left to right, then right to left). During each run, we determine how many elements to take based on the current number and the number of remaining elements. If the calculated remainder is less than 3, we add that number directly to the new structure. If it's 3 or more, we take a sub-array of elements starting from the current position.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We will create a function that takes a flat list and a depth value.\n   - We will process the list in alternating directions for the specified depth.\n   - For each number in the list, we will calculate how many elements to take based on the remainder of the division of the number by the count of remaining elements.\n   - We will build a new nested list according to the rules provided, recursively applying the same logic to any sub-arrays we create.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n       if depth is 0:\n           return flat_array\n       \n       new_array = []\n       direction = 1  // 1 for left to right, -1 for right to left\n       index = 0 if direction is 1 else length of flat_array - 1\n       \n       while index is within bounds of flat_array:\n           current_number = flat_array[index]\n           remaining_elements = length of flat_array - index\n           remainder = current_number % remaining_elements\n           \n           if remainder < 3:\n               new_array.append(current_number)\n               index += 1 if direction is 1 else -1\n           else:\n               sub_array = flat_array[index:index + remainder]\n               new_array.append(unflatten(sub_array, depth - 1))\n               index += remainder\n       \n       return new_array\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n    # Base case: if depth is 0, return the flat array as is\n    if depth == 0:\n        return flat_array\n    \n    new_array = []  # This will hold the unflattened result\n    direction = 1  # Start with left to right\n    index = 0  # Starting index for left to right\n    \n    while index < len(flat_array):  # Process until we reach the end of the array\n        current_number = flat_array[index]  # Get the current number\n        remaining_elements = len(flat_array) - index  # Count remaining elements\n        remainder = current_number % remaining_elements  # Calculate the remainder\n        \n        if remainder < 3:  # If remainder is less than 3\n            new_array.append(current_number)  # Add the number directly to the new array\n            index += 1  # Move to the next number\n        else:  # If remainder is 3 or more\n            sub_array = flat_array[index:index + remainder]  # Take the next 'remainder' elements\n            new_array.append(unflatten(sub_array, depth - 1))  # Recursively unflatten the sub-array\n            index += remainder  # Move the index forward by the size of the sub-array\n        \n        # Switch direction for the next run\n        direction *= -1  # Change direction for the next run\n    \n    return new_array  # Return the newly constructed array\n```",
