    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   Alice has a collection of cards represented as an array of integers. She wants to rearrange these cards into groups of size W, where each group consists of W consecutive integers. The task is to determine if it is possible to form such groups with the given cards.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, check if the total number of cards is divisible by W. If not, it's impossible to form the groups, so return false.\n   - Next, sort the array of cards. This will help in easily forming groups of consecutive integers.\n   - Use a frequency dictionary to count how many of each card we have.\n   - Iterate through the sorted unique cards and try to form groups of W consecutive cards. For each card, check if we can form a group starting from that card. If we can, decrease the count of those cards in the frequency dictionary accordingly.\n   - If we can successfully form all groups, return true; otherwise, return false.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function isNStraightHand(hand, W):\n       if length of hand is not divisible by W:\n           return false\n       \n       sort hand\n       create a frequency dictionary for hand\n       \n       for each card in sorted hand:\n           if frequency of card is greater than 0:\n               for i from 0 to W-1:\n                   if frequency of card + i is 0:\n                       return false\n                   decrease frequency of card + i by 1\n       \n       return true\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: list[int], W: int) -> bool:\n        # Step 1: Check if the total number of cards is divisible by W\n        if len(hand) % W != 0:\n            return False\n        \n        # Step 2: Sort the hand\n        hand.sort()\n        \n        # Step 3: Create a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each card\n        frequency = {}\n        for card in hand:\n            if card in frequency:\n                frequency[card] += 1\n            else:\n                frequency[card] = 1\n        \n        # Step 4: Try to form groups of W consecutive cards\n        for card in hand:\n            if frequency[card] > 0:  # If this card is still available\n                for i in range(W):\n                    if frequency.get(card + i, 0) <= 0:  # If we can't find the next card\n                        return False\n                    frequency[card + i] -= 1  # Use this card\n        \n        # If we successfully formed all groups, return true\n        return True\n```",
