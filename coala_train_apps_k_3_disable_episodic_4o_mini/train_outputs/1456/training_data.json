    "summary": "In this task, I was required to compute a specific representation of integers using XOR operations. The main challenge was to efficiently find pairs \\( (A, B) \\) such that \\( A \\oplus B = N \\) for each integer \\( N \\) in a given range \\( [L, R] \\). The solution involved defining two functions: \\( F(N) \\) to find the value of \\( B \\) for each \\( N \\), and \\( G(L, R) \\) to sum the results of \\( F(i) \\) for all integers \\( i \\) from \\( L \\) to \\( R \\).\n\nThe core concept was to iterate through possible values of \\( A \\) and compute \\( B \\) using the XOR operation. The conditions \\( 1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq N \\) were crucial for determining valid pairs. The implementation was straightforward, but care had to be taken to ensure efficiency given the constraints, especially since \\( R \\) could be as large as \\( 10^9 \\) and there could be up to \\( 10^5 \\) test cases.\n\nThe final solution was structured to read input efficiently and output results in bulk, which is important for handling large datasets. The code was successfully tested against provided examples, confirming its correctness. The approach of using simple loops and bitwise operations proved effective, although further optimization might be necessary for larger ranges in future scenarios. \n\nKey code snippet:\n```python\ndef F(N):\n    for A in range(1, N + 1):\n        B = A ^ N\n        if A <= B <= N:\n            return B\n    return -1\n\ndef G(L, R):\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(L, R + 1):\n        total_sum += F(i)\n    return total_sum\n```",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute the sum \\( G(L, R) \\) than my initial brute-force method. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Mathematical Summation**: The solution uses the formula for the sum of the first \\( x \\) integers, \\( \\text{summation\\_N} = \\frac{x(x+1)}{2} \\), to quickly compute the total sum of integers up to \\( R \\).\n\n2. **Bit Manipulation**: The function `GLR(x)` calculates the contribution of valid pairs \\( (A, B) \\) using bit manipulation. It iteratively counts how many integers can be formed with the current bit position and adjusts the total based on the powers of 2.\n\n3. **Efficient Range Calculation**: Instead of calculating \\( G(L, R) \\) directly, the solution computes it as \\( GLR(R) - GLR(L-1) \\). This allows for efficient computation by leveraging the results of previous calculations.\n\n4. **Logarithmic Adjustment**: The final adjustment in the calculation subtracts the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value, which accounts for the valid pairs that can be formed.\n\nOverall, the official solution is significantly more efficient, operating in logarithmic time relative to the input size, compared to my initial approach which was linear and could be too slow for large inputs. This experience highlights the importance of considering mathematical properties and bit manipulation techniques in problems involving integers and their representations.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThis function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, L and R. It calculates the sum of results from another function for all integers in the range from L to R. The results for each test case are collected in a list. Finally, it outputs all the results, each on a new line. The function handles input and output efficiently by reading all data at once and writing it in a single operation. It is designed to process potentially large ranges and multiple test cases in a streamlined manner.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to compute the sum of specific properties of integers over a range, particularly when dealing with bitwise operations like XOR. It can be applied in competitive programming, algorithm design, and cryptography where efficient calculations involving pairs of integers are required. Understanding how to derive values based on bitwise operations can also help in optimizing solutions for large input sizes, as seen in the constraints of this problem."
