The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \\( A[i] \\) by its index \\( i \\) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is \"YES\". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is \"NO\". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \\( N \\) natural numbers.\n\n    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \\( N(N + 1)/2 \\). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.\n\n    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is zero.\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.\n       - Returning \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n        \n            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array\n            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible\n        \n            if total_sum == 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n\n    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    ### Summary of Attempts for Permutation Problem\n\n    The task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the function \\( f(P) \\) equals a given integer \\( K \\). The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\).\n\n    #### Key Insights:\n    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \\( f(P) \\) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \\( K \\) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.\n    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \\( f(P) \\)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \\( K \\) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.\n\n    #### Issues Encountered:\n    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \\( K \\). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.\n    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.\n\n    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:\n    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.\n    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet:\n    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \\( K \\). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                # Start with descending order\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_sum = max_value\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to reach K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_sum == K:\n                        break\n                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K\n                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)\n                    if max_reduce > 0:\n                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce\n                        current_sum -= max_reduce\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n        print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
