## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The XOR pair representation (XPR) of a positive integer $N$ is defined as a pair of integers $(A, B)$ such that:
- $1 \le A \le B \le N$
- $A \oplus B = N$
- if there is no way to choose $A$ and $B$ satisfying the above conditions, $A = B = -1$
- otherwise, the value of $A$ should be the smallest possible
These conditions uniquely define the XPR. Next, we define a function $F(N)$ = the value of $B$ in $XPR(N)$, and a function $G(L, R) = \sum\limits_{i=L}^R F(i)$.
You are given $L$ and $R$. Compute $G(L, R)$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find a special pair of integers (A, B) for each integer N in a given range [L, R]. The pair must satisfy certain conditions involving the XOR operation. Specifically, A XOR B should equal N, and A should be the smallest possible integer that meets the criteria. If no such pair exists, we return -1 for both A and B. We then need to compute a function G(L, R) which sums up the values of B from the pairs found for each integer in the range.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - For each integer N from L to R, find the smallest A such that A XOR B = N and 1 â‰¤ A â‰¤ B â‰¤ N.
   - The value of B can be derived from B = A XOR N.
   - We can iterate through possible values of A starting from 1 up to N/2 (since A must be less than or equal to B).
   - If we find a valid A, we compute B and add it to our sum for the range.
   - If no valid A is found, we add 0 to the sum for that N.
   - Finally, we return the total sum for the range [L, R].

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function F(N):
       for A from 1 to N // 2:
           B = A XOR N
           if A <= B and B <= N:
               return B
       return -1

   function G(L, R):
       total_sum = 0
       for N from L to R:
           B = F(N)
           if B != -1:
               total_sum += B
       return total_sum

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \( A[i] \) by its index \( i \) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:

    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is "YES". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is "NO". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \( N \) natural numbers.

    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \( N(N + 1)/2 \). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.

    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is zero.
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
       - Returning "NO" otherwise.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
        
            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, A))

    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning "YES" or "NO".

    ### Summary of Attempts for Permutation Problem

    The task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the function \( f(P) \) equals a given integer \( K \). The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a permutation of size \( N \) is \( N(N-1)/2 \).

    #### Key Insights:
    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \( f(P) \) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \( K \) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.
    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \( f(P) \)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \( K \) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.

    #### Issues Encountered:
    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \( K \). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.
    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.

    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:
    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.
    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.

    #### Final Code Snippet:
    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \( K \). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.

    ```python
    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
            if K > max_value:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                # Start with descending order
                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                current_sum = max_value
            
                # Adjust the permutation to reach K
                for i in range(N - 1):
                    if current_sum == K:
                        break
                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K
                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)
                    if max_reduce > 0:
                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce
                        current_sum -= max_reduce
            
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
        print("\n".join(map(str, results)))
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.

   The problem involves finding a specific representation of a positive integer \( N \) using two integers \( A \) and \( B \) such that their XOR equals \( N \). The goal is to find the value of \( B \) for each integer from \( L \) to \( R \) and sum these values.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves finding a specific representation of a positive integer \( N \) using two integers \( A \) and \( B \) such that their XOR equals \( N \). The goal is to find the value of \( B \) for each integer from \( L \) to \( R \) and sum these values. If no valid \( A \) and \( B \) can be found for a given \( N \), we return -1 for that \( N \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each integer from \( L \) to \( R \). For each integer \( N \), we will find the smallest \( A \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \) and \( 1 \leq A \leq B \leq N \). The value of \( B \) can be derived from \( B = A \oplus N \). We will check for valid pairs \( (A, B) \) and if found, we will add \( B \) to our sum. If no valid pairs exist, we will add -1 to our sum.

- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The XOR pair representation (XPR) of a positive integer $N$ is defined as a pair of integers $(A, B)$ such that:
- $1 \le A \le B \le N$
- $A \oplus B = N$
- if there is no way to choose $A$ and $B$ satisfying the above conditions, $A = B = -1$
- otherwise, the value of $A$ should be the smallest possible
These conditions uniquely define the XPR. Next, we define a function $F(N)$ = the value of $B$ in $XPR(N)$, and a function $G(L, R) = \sum\limits_{i=L}^R F(i)$.
You are given $L$ and $R$. Compute $G(L, R)$.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the value of the function $G(L, R)$.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 10^5$
- $1 \le L \le R \le 10^9$

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] In this task, I was required to compute a specific representation of integers using XOR operations. The main challenge was to efficiently find pairs \( (A, B) \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \) for each integer \( N \) in a given range \( [L, R] \). The solution involved defining two functions: \( F(N) \) to find the value of \( B \) for each \( N \), and \( G(L, R) \) to sum the results of \( F(i) \) for all integers \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

The core concept was to iterate through possible values of \( A \) and compute \( B \) using the XOR operation. The conditions \( 1 \leq A \leq B \leq N \) were crucial for determining valid pairs. The implementation was straightforward, but care had to be taken to ensure efficiency given the constraints, especially since \( R \) could be as large as \( 10^9 \) and there could be up to \( 10^5 \) test cases.

The final solution was structured to read input efficiently and output results in bulk, which is important for handling large datasets. The code was successfully tested against provided examples, confirming its correctness. The approach of using simple loops and bitwise operations proved effective, although further optimization might be necessary for larger ranges in future scenarios. 

Key code snippet:
```python
def F(N):
    for A in range(1, N + 1):
        B = A ^ N
        if A <= B <= N:

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute the sum \( G(L, R) \) than my initial brute-force method. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Mathematical Summation**: The solution uses the formula for the sum of the first \( x \) integers, \( \text{summation\_N} = \frac{x(x+1)}{2} \), to quickly compute the total sum of integers up to \( R \).

2. **Bit Manipulation**: The function `GLR(x)` calculates the contribution of valid pairs \( (A, B) \) using bit manipulation. It iteratively counts how many integers can be formed with the current bit position and adjusts the total based on the powers of 2.

3. **Efficient Range Calculation**: Instead of calculating \( G(L, R) \) directly, the solution computes it as \( GLR(R) - GLR(L-1) \). This allows for efficient computation by leveraging the results of previous calculations.

4. **Logarithmic Adjustment**: The final adjustment in the calculation subtracts the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value, which accounts for the valid pairs that can be formed.

Overall, the official solution is significantly more efficient, operating in logarithmic time relative to the input size, compared to my initial approach which was linear and could be too slow for large inputs. This experience highlights the importance of considering mathematical properties and bit manipulation techniques in problems involving integers and their representations.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 1456 [generation text] This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, L and R. It calculates the sum of results from another function for all integers in the range from L to R. The results for each test case are collected in a list. Finally, it outputs all the results, each on a new line. The function handles input and output efficiently by reading all data at once and writing it in a single operation. It is designed to process potentially large ranges and multiple test cases in a streamlined manner.

[Problem]
    The XOR pair representation (XPR) of a positive integer $N$ is defined as a pair of integers $(A, B)$ such that:
    - $1 \le A \le B \le N$
    - $A \oplus B = N$
    - if there is no way to choose $A$ and $B$ satisfying the above conditions, $A = B = -1$
    - otherwise, the value of $A$ should be the smallest possible
    These conditions uniquely define the XPR. Next, we define a function $F(N)$ = the value of $B$ in $XPR(N)$, and a function $G(L, R) = \sum\limits_{i=L}^R F(i)$.
    You are given $L$ and $R$. Compute $G(L, R)$.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the value of the function $G(L, R)$.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
    - $1 \le L \le R \le 10^9$

    -----Example Input-----
    5
    1 10
    3 6
    4 10
    10 17
    100 159
