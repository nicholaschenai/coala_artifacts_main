You are trying to push array elements to the stack in the order $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\dots s_{l}$. Moreover, if the stack is empty or the element at the top of this stack is not equal to the current element, then you just push the current element to the top of the stack. Otherwise, you don't push the current element to the stack and, moreover, pop the top element of the stack. \n\nIf after this process the stack remains empty, the array $s$ is considered stack exterminable.\n\nThere are samples of stack exterminable arrays:   $[1, 1]$;  $[2, 1, 1, 2]$;  $[1, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2]$;  $[3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3]$;  $[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]$;  $[5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$; \n\nLet's consider the changing of stack more details if $s = [5, 1, 2, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5]$ (the top of stack is highlighted).   after pushing $s_1 = 5$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_2 = 1$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_3 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, 1, \\textbf{2}]$;  after pushing $s_4 = 2$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{1}]$;  after pushing $s_5 = 1$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_6 = 4$ the stack turn into $[5, \\textbf{4}]$;  after pushing $s_7 = 4$ the stack turn into $[\\textbf{5}]$;  after pushing $s_8 = 5$ the stack is empty. \n\nYou are given an array $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$.

The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays containing exactly `k` odd numbers from a given list of integers. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving subarrays and counts.\n\n    The core concept involved maintaining a count of odd numbers within a window defined by two pointers (left and right). As the right pointer expanded the window, the odd count was updated. If the count exceeded `k`, the left pointer was incremented to reduce the count back to `k`. When the count matched `k`, the number of valid subarrays was calculated by counting the even numbers to the left of the current window.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the sliding window technique is suitable for this type of problem. The key takeaway is the importance of managing two pointers to dynamically adjust the window size while keeping track of specific conditions (in this case, the count of odd numbers). \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n            result = 0\n            left = 0\n            odd_count = 0\n        \n            for right in range(len(nums)):\n                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:\n                    odd_count += 1\n            \n                while odd_count > k:\n                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:\n                        odd_count -= 1\n                    left += 1\n            \n                if odd_count == k:\n                    temp_left = left\n                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:\n                        temp_left += 1\n                    result += (temp_left - left + 1)\n        \n            return result\n    ``` \n\n    This approach effectively counts the desired subarrays while maintaining a linear time complexity, making it suitable for larger input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \\( A[i] \\) by its index \\( i \\) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is \"YES\". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is \"NO\". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \\( N \\) natural numbers.\n\n    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \\( N(N + 1)/2 \\). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.\n\n    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is zero.\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.\n       - Returning \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n        \n            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array\n            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible\n        \n            if total_sum == 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n\n    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "The official solution employs a more sophisticated approach using a trie-like structure to efficiently count stack exterminable subarrays. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Trie Structure**: The solution uses a trie to represent the stack states. Each node in the trie corresponds to a unique state of the stack, allowing for efficient tracking of how many times a particular stack configuration has been encountered.\n\n2. **Stack Management**: The algorithm maintains a stack to track the current elements being processed. When an element is pushed onto the stack, it creates or updates a node in the trie. If the element matches the top of the stack, it pops the element and moves up in the trie.\n\n3. **Counting Subarrays**: The solution counts exterminable subarrays by calculating the number of valid configurations at each step. It uses combinatorial counting to determine how many subarrays can be formed from the current stack state.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient in both time and space, as it avoids the need to explicitly check every possible subarray. Instead, it leverages the trie structure to keep track of configurations, leading to a more optimal solution.\n\n5. **Complexity**: The official solution is designed to handle the constraints of the problem effectively, ensuring that it operates within the limits of the input size.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach involved a brute-force method that checked each subarray individually, leading to a higher time complexity. The official solution's use of a trie structure and combinatorial counting provides a significant improvement in efficiency and scalability, making it a more suitable approach for the problem at hand."

        "content": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThe function processes multiple queries to count the number of \"exterminable\" subarrays in given integer arrays. It reads input data, which includes the number of queries and the respective arrays. For each array, it calculates the count of subarrays that can be completely removed based on specific conditions. The results for all queries are collected and printed in a single output. The function efficiently handles the input and output operations, ensuring that results are displayed in the required format. Overall, it provides a solution to a problem involving subarray manipulation and counting.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze sequences or arrays for specific properties related to stack operations. For example, in competitive programming, understanding how to determine stack exterminable subarrays can help solve problems involving data structures efficiently. It can also be applied in algorithm design where stack-like behavior is required, such as in parsing expressions or managing undo operations in applications. Additionally, this knowledge can be beneficial in teaching concepts of data structures and algorithms, particularly in understanding how stacks operate with push and pop operations."
