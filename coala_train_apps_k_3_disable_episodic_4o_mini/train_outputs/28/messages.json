Today he came with the following problem.\n\nYou are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string \"abacaba\" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?\n\nEach question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string \"a?b?c\" can be transformed into strings \"aabbc\" and \"azbzc\", but can't be transformed into strings \"aabc\", \"a?bbc\" and \"babbc\".\n\nOccurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \\leq i \\leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string \"ababa\" has two occurrences of a string \"aba\" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string \"aba\" in the string \"acba\" as a substring.\n\nPlease help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string \"abacaba\" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \\leq T \\leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.\n\nThe first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \\leq n \\leq 50$), length of a string $s$.\n\nThe second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case output an answer for it.\n\nIn case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string \"abacaba\" in the resulting string as a substring output \"No\".\n\nOtherwise output \"Yes\" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.\n\nYou may print every letter in \"Yes\" and \"No\" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n7\nabacaba\n7\n???????\n11\naba?abacaba\n11\nabacaba?aba\n15\nasdf???f???qwer\n11\nabacabacaba\n\nOutput\nYes\nabacaba\nYes\nabacaba\nYes\nabadabacaba\nYes\nabacabadaba\nNo\nNo\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string \"abacaba\" in the string \"abacaba\" as a substring.\n\nIn second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with \"abacaba\" in particular.\n\nIn sixth example there are two occurrences of a string \"abacaba\" as a substring.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring \"abc\" in the input string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if \"abc\" exists and the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of \"abc\" in one go. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the string is processed until no \"abc\" substrings remain.\n\n    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count(\"abc\")` to check for occurrences, which simplifies the condition for the while loop. In my initial solution, I used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit in terms of counting occurrences. The official solution's method is more efficient in that it directly removes all instances of \"abc\" in one operation, rather than removing them one at a time.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively, making it both easy to read and efficient. In future implementations, I should consider using similar built-in methods for string manipulation to enhance clarity and performance.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring \"abc\" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of \"abc\" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of \"abc\". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \\( A[i] \\) by its index \\( i \\) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is \"YES\". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is \"NO\". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \\( N \\) natural numbers.\n\n    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \\( N(N + 1)/2 \\). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.\n\n    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is zero.\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.\n       - Returning \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n        \n            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array\n            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible\n        \n            if total_sum == 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n\n    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The key insights for solving the problem included:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is \"YES\". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is \"NO\". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \\( N \\) natural numbers.\n\n    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \\( N(N + 1)/2 \\). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.\n\n    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is zero.\n       - Returning \"YES\" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.\n       - Returning \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N = case[0]\n            A = case[1]\n        \n            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array\n            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible\n        \n            if total_sum == 0:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n\n    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring \"abc\" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of \"abc\" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of \"abc\". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring \"abc\" in the input string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if \"abc\" exists and the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of \"abc\" in one go. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the string is processed until no \"abc\" substrings remain.\n\n    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count(\"abc\")` to check for occurrences, which simplifies the condition for the while loop. In my initial solution, I used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit in terms of counting occurrences. The official solution's method is more efficient in that it directly removes all instances of \"abc\" in one operation, rather than removing them one at a time.\n\n    Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively, making it both easy to read and efficient. In future implementations, I should consider using similar built-in methods for string manipulation to enhance clarity and performance.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Initial Count Check**:\n   - The solution starts by counting how many times \"abacaba\" appears in the string using the `check` function. This is crucial because if it already appears more than once, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n\n2. **Handling Existing Occurrences**:\n   - If \"abacaba\" is found exactly once, the solution replaces all remaining question marks with 'z' to ensure no additional occurrences are created.\n\n3. **Constructive Placement**:\n   - If \"abacaba\" is not found at all, the solution attempts to place it in every possible position in the string. It checks if it can fit by replacing question marks with the corresponding characters from \"abacaba\".\n\n4. **Validation After Placement**:\n   - After attempting to place \"abacaba\", the solution checks if the modified string contains exactly one occurrence of \"abacaba\". If it does, it prints the modified string; otherwise, it continues searching.\n\n5. **Efficiency**:\n   - The solution efficiently iterates through the string and uses a straightforward approach to check and replace characters, ensuring that it operates within the constraints provided.\n\n### Reflection on My Approach:\n- My initial approach failed to account for existing occurrences of \"abacaba\" before attempting to place it, which led to incorrect results in some cases.\n- The official solution's method of checking for existing occurrences first and then attempting to place \"abacaba\" is more systematic and avoids unnecessary complications.\n- The use of a temporary list to manipulate the string and check conditions is a good practice that I can adopt in future problems.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution effectively combines counting, conditional checks, and constructive placement to solve the problem. It serves as a reminder of the importance of validating conditions before making modifications, especially in string manipulation problems."

It first counts the initial occurrences of \"abacaba\" and then attempts to place it in the string at various positions, ensuring that it can be placed without conflicting with existing characters. If successful, it checks that \"abacaba\" appears exactly once after the placement. If the conditions are met, it replaces any remaining question marks in the string with a specified character, and outputs the modified string.

The function ultimately provides a solution for each test case based on the specified criteria.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to manipulate strings with specific patterns, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design. It can help in understanding how to handle wildcard characters (like question marks) in strings and how to ensure that a specific substring appears exactly once. This can be applied in text processing, data validation, and even in game development where string patterns are significant. Additionally, it can aid in learning about substring search algorithms and string modification techniques."
