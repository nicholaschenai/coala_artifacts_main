## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Help Saurabh with his Chemistry Assignment.

Saurabh has been given a chemistry assignment by Ruby Mam. Though the assignment is simple but

Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.

So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesnâ€™t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment

is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in

box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the

number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.

-----Input-----
The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space

separated integers N and X .

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo

10^6+3

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100000
- 1 â‰¤ N,X â‰¤ 10^18

-----Example-----
Input:
2
1 2
2 1

Output:
2
2

-----Explanation-----
Example case 2.At t=0 particles are 1 ,so at t=1 ,particles are 1*1 = 1 particles. At t=2, particles are 2*1 = 2 particles.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Saurabh needs to calculate the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `t` is determined by multiplying the number of particles at time `t-1` by `t`. The results can be very large, so we need to return the result modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve the problem, we need to compute the number of particles at time `N` based on the formula:
   - At `t=0`, particles = `X`
   - At `t=1`, particles = `1 * X`
   - At `t=2`, particles = `2 * (1 * X)`
   - At `t=3`, particles = `3 * (2 * (1 * X))`
   - And so on, until `t=N`.
   
   This can be simplified to:
   - Particles at time `N` = `X * N!` (N factorial).
   
   However, since `N` can be very large (up to \(10^{18}\)), calculating `N!` directly is impractical. Instead, we can use properties of modular arithmetic and the fact that \(N! \mod (10^6 + 3)\) will repeat after a certain point due to the factorial growth and the modulus.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function calculate_particles(N, X):
       MOD = 1000003
       if N >= MOD:
           return 0  // because N! will have MOD as a factor
       factorial = 1
       for i from 1 to N:
           factorial = (factorial * i) % MOD
       return (factorial * X) % MOD

   function main():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N, X
           result = calculate_particles(N, X)
           print result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def calculate_particles(N, X):
    MOD = 1000003
    # If N is greater than or equal to MOD, the result will be 0
    if N >= MOD:
        return 0  # because N! will have MOD as a factor
    factorial = 1
    # Calculate N! % MOD
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        factorial = (factorial * i) % MOD
    # Return (N! * X) % MOD
    return (factorial * X) % MOD

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective attendance frequencies. The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.

    The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.

    Key code snippets included:
    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            temp = b
            b = a % b
            a = temp
        return a

    def lcm(a, b):
        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

    def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):
        total_hours = N * 24
        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        return total_hours // lcm_value
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.

        You're given integer numbers $A$, $B$ and $N$. Find $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$ such that $Ax + By \leq N$ and $Ax + By$ is the maximum possible.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        In this problem it holds that $1 \leq A, B, N \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$, so it can be solved in $O(\sqrt N)$. However, there is $O(\log N)$ solution with continued fractions.

        For our convenience, we will invert the direction of $x$ by doing a substitution $x \mapsto \lfloor \frac{N}{A}\rfloor - x$, so that now we need to find the point $(x; y)$ such that $0 \leq x \leq \lfloor \frac{N}{A} \rfloor$, $By - Ax \leq N \;\bmod\; A$ and $By - Ax$ is the maximum possible. Optimal $y$ for each $x$ has a value of $\lfloor \frac{Ax + (N \bmod A)}{B} \rfloor$.

        To treat it more generically, we will write a function that finds the best point on $0 \leq x \leq N$ and $y = \lfloor \frac{Ax+B}{C} \rfloor$.

        Core solution idea in this problem essentially repeats the previous problem, but instead of using lower semiconvergents to diverge from line, you use upper semiconvergents to get closer to the line without crossing it and without violating $x \leq N$. Unfortunately, unlike the previous problem, you need to make sure that you don't cross the $y=\frac{Ax+B}{C}$ line while getting closer to it, so you should keep it in mind when calculating semiconvergent's coefficient $t$.

        Given $p$, $q$ and $n$, compute $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n [p \cdot i \bmod q]$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This problem reduces to the previous one if you note that $a \bmod b = a - \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor b$. With this fact, the sum reduces to

        $$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left(p \cdot i - \left\lfloor \frac{p \cdot i}{q} \right\rfloor q\right) = \frac{pn(n+1)}{2}-q\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left\lfloor \frac{p \cdot i}{q}\right\rfloor.$$

        However, summing up $\lfloor rx \rfloor$ for $x$ from $1$ to $N$ is something that we're capable of from the previous problem.

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires calculating the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`. The number of particles at time `t` is defined as `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. The output should be the number of particles at time `N`, modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   The number of particles at time `t` can be expressed as:
   - At `t=0`: `X`
   - At `t=1`: `1 * X`
   - At `t=2`: `2 * (1 * X) = 2 * X`
   - At `t=3`: `3 * (2 * X) = 6 * X`
   - At `t=4`: `4 * (6 * X) = 24 * X`
   - ...
   This pattern shows that the number of particles at time `N` is `N! * X`, where `N!` is the factorial of `N`. Given the constraints (with `N` being as large as \(10^{18}\)), calculating `N!` directly is impractical. Instead, we can compute `N!` modulo \(10^6 + 3\) using properties of modular arithmetic and the fact that factorials grow quickly.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Help Saurabh with his Chemistry Assignment.

Saurabh has been given a chemistry assignment by Ruby Mam. Though the assignment is simple but

Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.

So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesnâ€™t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment

is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in

box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the

number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.

-----Input-----
The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space

separated integers N and X .

-----Output-----
For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo

10^6+3

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100000
- 1 â‰¤ N,X â‰¤ 10^18

-----Example-----
Input:
2
1 2
2 1

Output:
2

INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] The problem involved calculating the number of particles in a box at a given time `N`, starting with `X` particles at time `t=0`, where the number of particles at time `t` is defined as `t` times the number of particles at time `t-1`. The solution required computing `N! * X` modulo \(10^6 + 3\). 

Key insights included recognizing that for large values of `N` (up to \(10^{18}\)), directly calculating `N!` is impractical. Instead, I implemented a function to compute the factorial modulo \(10^6 + 3\), leveraging the fact that if `N` is greater than or equal to the modulus, the result would be zero due to the factorial containing the modulus as a factor.

The final implementation efficiently handled multiple test cases by reading input in bulk and processing each case in a loop. The results were stored and printed at once to optimize output performance. The code passed all provided test cases, confirming its correctness.

Hereâ€™s the core function for calculating factorial modulo:

```python
def factorial_mod(n, mod):
    if n >= mod:
        return 0
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result = (result * i) % mod
    return result
```

The overall approach demonstrated effective use of modular arithmetic and efficient input/output handling for potentially large datasets.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
a = [1]
M = 10**6 + 3
for ii in range(1, 1000005):
 a.append((a[-1]*ii)%M)
for __ in range(eval(input())):
 n, x = list(map(int, input().split()))
 if n>=M: print(0)
 else: print((a[n]*x)%M)


INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] The official solution employs a precomputation strategy to efficiently handle the factorial calculations modulo \(10^6 + 3\). Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials:** The solution initializes a list `a` to store the factorial values modulo \(10^6 + 3\) for all integers from `0` to `1000004`. This allows for constant-time retrieval of factorial values during each test case, significantly improving efficiency compared to recalculating the factorial for each input.

2. **Handling Large Inputs:** The solution checks if `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^6 + 3\). If it is, the output is immediately `0` because \(n!\) will contain \(10^6 + 3\) as a factor, making it congruent to `0` modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

3. **Efficient Output Calculation:** For valid values of `n`, the solution retrieves the precomputed factorial and multiplies it by `x`, applying the modulo operation to ensure the result remains within bounds.

In contrast, my initial approach involved calculating the factorial on-the-fly, which is inefficient for large values of `N` (up to \(10^{18}\)). This would lead to performance issues and potential overflow errors. The official solution's use of precomputation and direct indexing is a more effective strategy for handling the constraints of the problem.

Overall, the official solution demonstrates the importance of precomputation in optimizing performance for problems involving repeated calculations, especially when dealing with large input sizes.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 1032 [generation text] This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, N and X. It calculates the factorial of N modulo a predefined value (10^6 + 3) and then multiplies this result by X, also taking the modulo. The results for all test cases are collected and printed sequentially. The function handles the input and output directly, making it suitable for competitive programming scenarios. It ensures efficient computation by leveraging modular arithmetic to prevent overflow. Overall, it provides a systematic approach to solving the problem of computing modified factorials for given inputs.

    Saurabh has been given a chemistry assignment by Ruby Mam. Though the assignment is simple but

    Saurabh has to watch India vs Pakistan Match and he has no time to do the assignment by himself.

    So Saurabh wants you to do his assignment so that he doesnâ€™t get scolded by Ruby Mam . The assignment

    is as follows , Suppose there are X particles initially at time t=0 in a box. At a time t the number of particles in

    box becomes t times the number of particles at time t-1 . You will be given N and X where N is time at which the

    number of particles in box is to be calculated and X is the number of particles at time t=0.

    -----Input-----
    The first line will contain the integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two space

    separated integers N and X .

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, output the answer to the query. Since the output can be very large, output the answer modulo

    10^6+3

    -----Constraints-----
