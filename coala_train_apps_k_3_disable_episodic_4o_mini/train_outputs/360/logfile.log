## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4

Example 3:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000
1 <= weights[i] <= 500

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine the minimum weight capacity of a ship that can transport a series of packages within a specified number of days. The packages must be loaded in the order they are given, and the total weight loaded each day cannot exceed the ship's capacity.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. The idea is to find the minimum capacity that allows us to ship all packages within the given number of days. We will set the lower bound of our search to the maximum weight of a single package (since the ship must be able to carry at least the heaviest package) and the upper bound to the total weight of all packages (which would be the capacity if we shipped everything in one day). We will then check if a given capacity can ship all packages within the allowed days by simulating the loading process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
       set left to max(weights)  // minimum possible capacity
       set right to sum(weights)  // maximum possible capacity
       
       while left < right:
           set mid to (left + right) // 2
           if canShip(weights, mid, D):
               set right to mid  // try for a smaller capacity
           else:
               set left to mid + 1  // increase capacity
       
       return left  // this is the minimum capacity that works

   function canShip(weights, capacity, D):
       set days to 1
       set currentWeight to 0
       
       for weight in weights:
           if currentWeight + weight > capacity:
               increment days
               set currentWeight to weight  // start new day with this package
           else:
               add weight to currentWeight
       
       return days <= D  // check if we can ship within D days
   ```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_contests(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.

    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.

    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            total_weight = sum(stones)
            target = total_weight // 2
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True

            for stone in stones:
                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    return total_weight - 2 * j
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money to a group of minions such that he ends up with exactly zero money left. The key concepts involved were understanding the total demand from the minions and ensuring that each individual demand could be satisfied without exceeding the amount of money Gru had at any point.

    Initially, the approach was to simply check if the total demand equaled the amount of money Gru had. However, this was insufficient because it did not account for the individual demands of the minions. The correct approach required checking both the total demand and ensuring that each individual demand was less than or equal to the money Gru had.

    The final solution involved calculating the total demand and checking if it matched Gru's total money. If it did, the output was "YES"; otherwise, it was "NO". However, the solution failed to pass the tests because it did not consider the scenario where the total demand could be less than Gru's money but still not allow for exact distribution.

    The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of considering both aggregate and individual constraints when solving distribution problems. The final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Extract number of minions and amount of money Gru has
            A = case[2]  # Extract the list of demands from minions
        
            total_demand = sum(A)  # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by minions
        
            # Check if the total demand equals the money Gru has
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")  # Gru can distribute the money exactly
            else:
                print("NO")  # Gru cannot distribute the money as required
    ```

    This experience highlighted the need for careful consideration of problem constraints and the importance of validating both total and individual conditions in distribution scenarios.

We will set the lower bound of our search to the maximum weight of a single package (since the ship must be able to carry at least the heaviest package) and the upper bound to the total weight of all packages (which would be the capacity if we shipped everything in one day). We will then check for each mid-point capacity if it is possible to ship all packages within the allowed days. If it is possible, we will try a smaller capacity; if not, we will increase the capacity.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function shipWithinDays(weights, D):
       set left to max(weights)  // minimum possible capacity
       set right to sum(weights)  // maximum possible capacity

       while left < right:
           set mid to (left + right) // 2
           if canShip(weights, mid, D):
               right = mid  // try for a smaller capacity
           else:
               left = mid + 1  // increase capacity

       return left  // this is the minimum capacity that works

   function canShip(weights, capacity, D):
       set days to 1
       set currentWeight to 0

       for weight in weights:
           if currentWeight + weight > capacity:
               days += 1
               currentWeight = weight  // start a new day
           else:
               currentWeight += weight

       return days <= D
   ```

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: 
A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

Example 2:
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] In this task, I was required to determine the minimum weight capacity of a ship that can transport packages within a specified number of days. The approach I used was a binary search strategy, which is effective for problems involving finding a minimum or maximum value under certain constraints.

The core concepts involved were:
1. **Binary Search**: This was used to efficiently narrow down the possible ship capacities between the maximum weight of a single package and the total weight of all packages.
2. **Greedy Approach**: The helper function `canShip` was implemented to check if a given capacity allows shipping all packages within the specified days by simulating the loading process.

The final solution was structured with a main function `shipWithinDays` that performs the binary search and a helper function `canShip` that checks the feasibility of a given capacity. The code was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without issues.

Key code snippets:
```python
while left < right:
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    if self.canShip(weights, mid, D):
        right = mid
    else:
        left = mid + 1

return left
```

Overall, the experience reinforced the effectiveness of combining binary search with a greedy checking mechanism for optimization problems involving constraints. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution was efficient enough to handle the problem's constraints.

            else:
                right = mid
        return left

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] The official solution employs a binary search strategy to efficiently determine the minimum ship capacity required to transport packages within a specified number of days. The key insights from the official solution are as follows:

1. **Initialization of Bounds**: The left bound is set to the maximum weight of a single package, ensuring that the ship can at least carry the heaviest package. The right bound is calculated as the total weight divided by the number of days, which provides an upper limit on the capacity needed if the packages were evenly distributed across the days.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The solution iteratively narrows down the possible ship capacities. For each mid-point capacity, it checks if all packages can be shipped within the allowed days. If the number of days required exceeds D, it means the capacity is too low, and the search continues in the upper half. Conversely, if it can be shipped within D days, it attempts to find a smaller capacity.

3. **Counting Days**: The inner loop counts how many days are needed for the current mid capacity. If adding a package exceeds the capacity, it increments the day count and resets the current weight to the weight of the new package.

4. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient, operating in O(N log W) time complexity, where N is the number of packages and W is the range of possible weights. This is due to the binary search over the weight capacity combined with a linear scan of the weights.

In contrast, my initial solution was similar in approach but had a slight oversight in the upper bound calculation. I used the total weight as the upper limit without considering the distribution of weights across days, which could lead to inefficiencies. The official solution's method of calculating the right bound as `left * len(weights) // D` is more effective in bounding the search space. 

Overall, the official solution is a refined version of the binary search approach that effectively balances the constraints of the problem while ensuring optimal performance.

INFO - [Task id] 360 [generation text] The function determines the minimum shipping capacity required to transport a list of package weights within a specified number of days. It uses binary search to efficiently find this capacity by setting initial bounds based on the maximum single package weight and the total weight of all packages. During the search, it checks if the current capacity can accommodate the shipping within the given days by simulating the loading process. If the capacity is sufficient, it attempts to find a smaller capacity; otherwise, it increases the capacity. The process continues until the optimal capacity is identified. Finally, it returns the minimum capacity that allows for shipping within the specified timeframe.

[Problem]
    A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within D days.
    The i-th package on the conveyor belt has a weight of weights[i].Â  Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by weights). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.
    Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within D days.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
    Output: 15
    Explanation: 
    A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
    1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    2nd day: 6, 7
    3rd day: 8
    4th day: 9
    5th day: 10

    Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed. 

    Example 2:
    Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
    Output: 6
    Explanation: 
    A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
    1st day: 3, 2
    2nd day: 2, 4
    3rd day: 1, 4

    Example 3:
    Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    1st day: 1
    2nd day: 2
    3rd day: 3
    4th day: 1, 1

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= D <= weights.length <= 50000
    1 <= weights[i] <= 500

[Solution]

    class Solution:
        def shipWithinDays(self, weights: list[int], D: int) -> int:
            # Set the lower bound to the maximum weight of a single package
            left = max(weights)
            # Set the upper bound to the total weight of all packages
            right = sum(weights)

            # Perform binary search to find the minimum capacity
            while left < right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2  # Calculate the mid capacity
                if self.canShip(weights, mid, D):
                    right = mid  # If we can ship with mid capacity, try smaller
                else:
                    left = mid + 1  # If not, increase the capacity

            return left  # The minimum capacity that allows shipping in D days

        def canShip(self, weights: list[int], capacity: int, D: int) -> bool:
            days = 1  # Start with one day
            currentWeight = 0  # Current weight loaded on the ship

            for weight in weights:
                if currentWeight + weight > capacity:
                    days += 1  # Need a new day
                    currentWeight = weight  # Start loading the new day with this weight
                else:
                    currentWeight += weight  # Load the weight onto the current day

            return days <= D  # Check if we can ship within D days
