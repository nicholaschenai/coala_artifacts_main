The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where each schedule consists of dishes served over N days with specific constraints. The key requirements were that no two consecutive days could serve the same dish, and the first and last days must serve different dishes.\n\n    Initially, I derived a formula based on combinatorial reasoning, which was incorrect. The correct formula should have been \\(4 \\times 3^{(N-1)}\\) for \\(N \\geq 2\\). This accounts for:\n    - 4 choices for the first day.\n    - 3 choices for each subsequent day, including the last day, which must be different from the first.\n\n    The main errors in my attempts included:\n    1. Miscalculating the total schedules by incorrectly treating the last day as a separate case.\n    2. Failing to properly implement the formula in the code, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    The final working code correctly implements the formula and uses an efficient power function to handle large exponents modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). The key takeaway is the importance of carefully analyzing constraints and ensuring that all conditions are accurately reflected in the mathematical model used for calculations. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def power(base, exp, mod):\n        result = 1\n        while exp > 0:\n            if exp % 2 == 1:\n                result = (result * base) % mod\n            base = (base * base) % mod\n            exp //= 2\n        return result\n\n    def calculate_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return 12\n        else:\n            return (4 * power(3, N-1, MOD)) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            result = calculate_schedules(N)\n            print(result)\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of validating mathematical models against problem constraints and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the derived formulas.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, including only every Kth Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.\n\n    The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. \n\n    The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. \n\n    Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def fibonacci(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        if n == 1:\n            return 1\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\n    def S(N, K):\n        sum_fib = 0\n        for i in range(0, N + 1):\n            if i % K == 0:\n                sum_fib += fibonacci(i)\n        return sum_fib\n    ``` \n\n    Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The first inner loop determines how many times \\( i^n \\) can be added without exceeding \\( x \\). The second inner loop updates the `reach` array in reverse to avoid using the same integer multiple times in the same iteration.\n\n4. **Final Output**: After processing all integers and their powers, the final result is found in `reach[x]`, which gives the total number of ways to form the sum \\( x \\).\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- The use of a dynamic programming approach is efficient for this problem, as it avoids the overhead of recursion and memoization.\n- The method of updating the `reach` array in reverse is crucial to ensure that each integer is only counted once per combination.\n- This solution is more straightforward and likely more efficient than the recursive approach I initially implemented, especially for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\nIn future problems involving combinations or partitions, considering dynamic programming as a first approach could lead to more efficient solutions."
