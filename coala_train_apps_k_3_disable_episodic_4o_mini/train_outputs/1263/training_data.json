    "summary": "In this task, I was required to find the number of ways to express a natural number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \\( K \\). The solution involved a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the valid combinations without repeating calculations.\n\nThe core concept tested here was the use of recursion to explore combinations while ensuring uniqueness of integers. The recursive function `countWays` was designed to track the current sum and the last integer used, preventing the reuse of integers. Memoization was implemented to store previously computed results for specific states, which significantly improved performance.\n\nThe final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, reading multiple test cases and producing the correct results. The code was structured to first define helper functions and then the main function, adhering to the specified format. Overall, the approach was effective, and the solution passed all provided test cases without errors. \n\nKey code snippet:\n```python\ndef countWays(N, K, current, last, memo):\n    # Base case: if current sum equals N, we found a valid way\n    if current == N:\n        return 1\n    # If current sum exceeds N, this path is invalid\n    if current > N:\n        return 0\n    # Check if the result is already computed\n    if (current, last) in memo:\n        return memo[(current, last)]\n    \n    totalWays = 0\n    # Start from the next integer after 'last'\n    for i in range(last + 1, N + 1):\n        totalWays += countWays(N, K, current + i**K, i, memo)\n    \n    # Store the result in memoization dictionary\n    memo[(current, last)] = totalWays\n    return totalWays\n``` \n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of recursion and memoization in solving combinatorial problems efficiently.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of counting the ways to express a number \\( N \\) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \\( K \\). Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The solution uses an array `reach` where `reach[j]` keeps track of the number of ways to form the sum \\( j \\) using the unique integers raised to the power \\( n \\). The array is initialized with `reach[0] = 1`, indicating that there is one way to achieve a sum of zero (by using no numbers).\n\n2. **Iterating Over Powers**: The outer loop iterates over integers \\( i \\) starting from 1, calculating \\( i^n \\) until it exceeds \\( x \\). This ensures that only valid powers are considered.\n\n3. **Updating the Reach Array**: For each power \\( i^n \\), the inner loops update the `reach` array. The first inner loop determines how many times \\( i^n \\) can be added without exceeding \\( x \\). The second inner loop updates the `reach` array in reverse to avoid using the same integer multiple times in the same iteration.\n\n4. **Final Output**: After processing all integers and their powers, the final result is found in `reach[x]`, which gives the total number of ways to form the sum \\( x \\).\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n- The use of a dynamic programming approach is efficient for this problem, as it avoids the overhead of recursion and memoization.\n- The method of updating the `reach` array in reverse is crucial to ensure that each integer is only counted once per combination.\n- This solution is more straightforward and likely more efficient than the recursive approach I initially implemented, especially for larger values of \\( N \\).\n\nIn future problems involving combinations or partitions, considering dynamic programming as a first approach could lead to more efficient solutions.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThis function reads multiple test cases from input, where each test case consists of two integers, N and K. It initializes a memoization dictionary to store previously computed results for efficiency. For each test case, it calls a recursive function to count the number of ways to express N as a sum of K-th powers of distinct integers. The results for all test cases are collected and printed sequentially. The function effectively handles the input and output while leveraging memoization to optimize the counting process.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to find combinations of unique integers that sum up to a specific number, particularly when the integers are raised to a certain power. This can be applied in combinatorial mathematics, algorithm design, and optimization problems where constraints on uniqueness and specific summation are present. It can also be relevant in programming contests or interviews where dynamic programming and recursion are tested."
