## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to find the number of unique ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). Each test case provides values for \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to compute the number of valid combinations for each case.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with backtracking. We will:
   - Generate all possible unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers do not exceed \( N \).
   - Use a recursive function to explore combinations of these integers, checking if their \( K \)-th powers can sum up to \( N \).
   - Keep track of the current sum and the integers used to ensure they are unique.
   - Count the valid combinations that sum to \( N \).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function countWays(N, K):
       initialize a list to store unique integers whose K-th power is <= N
       for i from 1 to the maximum integer such that i^K <= N:
           add i to the list
       
       define a recursive function backtrack(current_sum, start_index):
           if current_sum == N:
               return 1  // found a valid combination
           if current_sum > N:
               return 0  // exceeded the target
           
           count = 0
           for i from start_index to the length of the list:
               count += backtrack(current_sum + list[i]^K, i + 1)  // move to the next integer
           return count
       
       return backtrack(0, 0)  // start with sum 0 and first index

   read T
   for each test case:
       read N, K
       print countWays(N, K)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def countWays(N, K):
    # Generate a list of unique integers whose K-th power is <= N
    unique_numbers = []
    i = 1
    while i ** K <= N:
        unique_numbers.append(i)
        i += 1

    # Recursive function to count the ways to sum to N using unique integers
    def backtrack(current_sum, start_index):
        if current_sum == N:
            return 1  # Found a valid combination
        if current_sum > N:
            return 0  # Exceeded the target
        
        count = 0
        for i in range(start_index, len(unique_numbers)):
            # Include unique_numbers[i] and move to the next index
            count += backtrack(current_sum + unique_numbers[i] ** K, i + 1)
        return count

    return backtrack(0, 0)  # Start with sum 0 and first index

# Read number of test cases
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    # Read N and K for each test case
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    # Print the result for each test case

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where each schedule consists of dishes served over N days with specific constraints. The key requirements were that no two consecutive days could serve the same dish, and the first and last days must serve different dishes.

    Initially, I derived a formula based on combinatorial reasoning, which was incorrect. The correct formula should have been \(4 \times 3^{(N-1)}\) for \(N \geq 2\). This accounts for:
    - 4 choices for the first day.
    - 3 choices for each subsequent day, including the last day, which must be different from the first.

    The main errors in my attempts included:
    1. Miscalculating the total schedules by incorrectly treating the last day as a separate case.
    2. Failing to properly implement the formula in the code, leading to incorrect outputs.

    The final working code correctly implements the formula and uses an efficient power function to handle large exponents modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The key takeaway is the importance of carefully analyzing constraints and ensuring that all conditions are accurately reflected in the mathematical model used for calculations. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def power(base, exp, mod):
        result = 1
        while exp > 0:
            if exp % 2 == 1:
                result = (result * base) % mod
            base = (base * base) % mod
            exp //= 2
        return result

    def calculate_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * power(3, N-1, MOD)) % MOD

    def main():
        T = int(input())
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            print(result)

    main()
    ``` 

    This experience highlighted the importance of validating mathematical models against problem constraints and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the derived formulas.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, including only every Kth Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.

    The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. 

    The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. 

    Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. 

    Here’s the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def fibonacci(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b

    def S(N, K):
        sum_fib = 0
        for i in range(0, N + 1):
            if i % K == 0:
                sum_fib += fibonacci(i)
        return sum_fib
    ``` 

    Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem requires us to find the number of ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). Each test case provides values for \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to compute the total number of valid combinations for each case.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization. We will define a function that tries to build the sum \( N \) using integers starting from a given number. For each integer, we will either include it in our sum (raising it to the power \( K \)) or skip it. We will keep track of the current sum and the last integer used to ensure that we only use unique integers. The base case will be when the current sum equals \( N \) (indicating a valid combination) or exceeds \( N \) (indicating an invalid combination).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function countWays(N, K, current, last):
       if current == N:
           return 1
       if current > N:
           return 0
       totalWays = 0
       for i from last + 1 to N:

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem requires us to find the number of ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). Each test case provides values for \( N \) and \( K \), and we need to compute the total number of valid combinations for each case.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization. We will define a function that tries to build the sum \( N \) using integers starting from a given number. For each integer, we will either include it in our sum (raising it to the power \( K \)) or skip it. We will keep track of the current sum and the last integer used to ensure that we only use unique integers. The base case will be when the current sum equals \( N \) (indicating a valid combination) or exceeds \( N \) (indicating an invalid combination).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function countWays(N, K, current, last):
       if current == N:
           return 1
       if current > N:
           return 0
       totalWays = 0
       for i from last + 1 to N:
           totalWays += countWays(N, K, current + i^K, i)

           read N, K
           result = countWays(N, K, 0, 0)

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] In this task, I was required to find the number of ways to express a natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power of \( K \). The solution involved a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently count the valid combinations without repeating calculations.

The core concept tested here was the use of recursion to explore combinations while ensuring uniqueness of integers. The recursive function `countWays` was designed to track the current sum and the last integer used, preventing the reuse of integers. Memoization was implemented to store previously computed results for specific states, which significantly improved performance.

The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, reading multiple test cases and producing the correct results. The code was structured to first define helper functions and then the main function, adhering to the specified format. Overall, the approach was effective, and the solution passed all provided test cases without errors. 

Key code snippet:
```python
def countWays(N, K, current, last, memo):
    # Base case: if current sum equals N, we found a valid way
    if current == N:
        return 1
    # If current sum exceeds N, this path is invalid
    if current > N:
        return 0
    # Check if the result is already computed
    if (current, last) in memo:
        return memo[(current, last)]
    
    totalWays = 0
    # Start from the next integer after 'last'
    for i in range(last + 1, N + 1):
        totalWays += countWays(N, K, current + i**K, i, memo)
    
    # Store the result in memoization dictionary
    memo[(current, last)] = totalWays
    return totalWays
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of recursion and memoization in solving combinatorial problems efficiently.

        while j>=0:

            j-=1
        i+=1
    #print(reach)
    print(reach[-1])

INFO - [Task id] 1263 [generation text] The official solution employs a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of counting the ways to express a number \( N \) as the sum of unique integers raised to the power \( K \). Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The solution uses an array `reach` where `reach[j]` keeps track of the number of ways to form the sum \( j \) using the unique integers raised to the power \( n \). The array is initialized with `reach[0] = 1`, indicating that there is one way to achieve a sum of zero (by using no numbers).

2. **Iterating Over Powers**: The outer loop iterates over integers \( i \) starting from 1, calculating \( i^n \) until it exceeds \( x \). This ensures that only valid powers are considered.

3. **Updating the Reach Array**: For each power \( i^n \), the inner loops update the `reach` array. The first inner loop determines how many times \( i^n \) can be added without exceeding \( x \). The second inner loop updates the `reach` array in reverse to avoid using the same integer multiple times in the same iteration.

4. **Final Output**: After processing all integers and their powers, the final result is found in `reach[x]`, which gives the total number of ways to form the sum \( x \).

### Key Takeaways:
- The use of a dynamic programming approach is efficient for this problem, as it avoids the overhead of recursion and memoization.
- The method of updating the `reach` array in reverse is crucial to ensure that each integer is only counted once per combination.
- This solution is more straightforward and likely more efficient than the recursive approach I initially implemented, especially for larger values of \( N \).

In future problems involving combinations or partitions, considering dynamic programming as a first approach could lead to more efficient solutions.

[Problem]
    The chef was playing with numbers and he found that natural number N can be obtained by sum various unique natural numbers, For challenging himself chef wrote one problem statement, which he decided to solve in future.
    Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
    After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
    New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
    But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

    -----Input:-----
    - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
    - Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \leq T \leq 10$
    - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
    - $1 \leq K \leq 6$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2
    4 1
    38 2

    -----Sample Output:-----
    2
    1

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
    But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
    For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25

    def countWays(N, K, current, last, memo):
        # Base case: if current sum equals N, we found a valid way
        if current == N:
            return 1
        # If current sum exceeds N, this path is invalid
        if current > N:
            return 0
        # Check if the result is already computed
        if (current, last) in memo:
            return memo[(current, last)]
    
        totalWays = 0
        # Start from the next integer after 'last'
        for i in range(last + 1, N + 1):
            totalWays += countWays(N, K, current + i**K, i, memo)
    
        # Store the result in memoization dictionary
        memo[(current, last)] = totalWays
        return totalWays

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N, K = map(int, data[i].split())
            memo = {}  # Initialize memoization dictionary
            result = countWays(N, K, 0, 0, memo)  # Start the recursive counting
            results.append(result)
    
        # Print all results for each test case
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
