The solution utilized a dynamic programming approach, which is a common strategy for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index, updating it based on previous elements.\n\n    The implemented algorithm iterated through the input array, comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length of the subsequence was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by taking the maximum value from the array that tracked the lengths.\n\n    The code snippet for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            d = [1] * len(nums)\n        \n            for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This approach runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem constraints. The solution was successful, passing all tests, indicating that the dynamic programming strategy was effective in this case. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The approach involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the current arrangement, as the books not in this subsequence would need to be moved.\n\n    The solution utilized a dynamic programming technique to compute the LIS. The key steps included initializing an array to track the lengths of increasing subsequences and iterating through the books to update these lengths based on comparisons. The final result was derived by subtracting the length of the LIS from the total number of books.\n\n    The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test case. The main takeaway is the effectiveness of the LIS approach in minimizing moves for sorting problems, which can be applied to similar scenarios involving permutations and orderings. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n        lis = [1] * N\n        for i in range(1, N):\n            for j in range(i):\n                if books[i] > books[j]:\n                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)\n        longest_increasing_length = max(lis)\n        return N - longest_increasing_length\n\n    N = int(input())\n    books = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))\n    ``` \n\n    This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution employs a more efficient approach to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) using a combination of dynamic programming and binary search, achieving a time complexity of O(n log n). This is a significant improvement over the O(n^2) complexity of my initial solution.\n\n    Key insights from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns 0. It initializes a list `res` to keep track of the smallest tail values of increasing subsequences found so far.\n\n    2. **Binary Search**: A helper function `binarySearch` is defined to find the position in the `res` list where the current number should be placed. This function uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the correct index, ensuring that the `res` list remains sorted.\n\n    3. **Iterating through the input**: The solution iterates through the input list starting from the second element. If the current number is greater than the last element in `res`, it appends the number to `res`. Otherwise, it uses the `binarySearch` function to find the appropriate index to replace an existing value in `res`, maintaining the property of the smallest tail values.\n\n    4. **Final Result**: The length of the `res` list at the end of the iteration represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    The official solution is more efficient because it reduces the number of comparisons needed to maintain the increasing subsequence, leveraging the sorted nature of the `res` list and the logarithmic time complexity of binary search. This approach is particularly useful for larger datasets where performance is critical. \n\n    In contrast, my initial solution, while correct, was less efficient due to the nested loops that resulted in a quadratic time complexity. This experience highlights the importance of considering different algorithmic strategies, especially when dealing with problems that can be optimized through data structures like lists and search algorithms.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

Instead, it collects all vertices in the path from vertex 1 to all other vertices, which is not what we want.\n   - The values extracted from the path are not correctly filtered to only include those up to vertex k.\n   - The output format is incorrect. The expected output is a list of integers, but the code is returning strings.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   - The DFS function should be modified to stop when it reaches vertex k, rather than traversing the entire tree.\n   - The values extracted from the path should only include the values of vertices that are part of the path from vertex 1 to vertex k.\n   - The output should be printed as integers, not strings.\n\n### Revised Plan:\n1.

The main takeaway is the effectiveness of the LIS approach in minimizing moves for sorting problems, which can be applied to similar scenarios involving permutations and orderings. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n        lis = [1] * N\n        for i in range(1, N):\n            for j in range(i):\n                if books[i] > books[j]:\n                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)\n        longest_increasing_length = max(lis)\n        return N - longest_increasing_length\n\n    N = int(input())\n    books = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))\n    ``` \n\n    This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution employs a more efficient approach to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) using a combination of dynamic programming and binary search, achieving a time complexity of O(n log n). This is a significant improvement over the O(n^2) complexity of my initial solution.\n\n    Key insights from the official solution:\n\n    1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns 0. It initializes a list `res` to keep track of the smallest tail values of increasing subsequences found so far.\n\n    2. **Binary Search**: A helper function `binarySearch` is defined to find the position in the `res` list where the current number should be placed. This function uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the correct index, ensuring that the `res` list remains sorted.\n\n    3. **Iterating through the input**: The solution iterates through the input list starting from the second element. If the current number is greater than the last element in `res`, it appends the number to `res`. Otherwise, it uses the `binarySearch` function to find the appropriate index to replace an existing value in `res`, maintaining the property of the smallest tail values.\n\n    4. **Final Result**: The length of the `res` list at the end of the iteration represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    The official solution is more efficient because it reduces the number of comparisons needed to maintain the increasing subsequence, leveraging the sorted nature of the `res` list and the logarithmic time complexity of binary search. This approach is particularly useful for larger datasets where performance is critical. \n\n    In contrast, my initial solution, while correct, was less efficient due to the nested loops that resulted in a quadratic time complexity. This experience highlights the importance of considering different algorithmic strategies, especially when dealing with problems that can be optimized through data structures like lists and search algorithms.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The official solution employs a more sophisticated approach using binary search and a depth-first search (DFS) that optimally tracks the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) during the traversal of the tree.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n1. **Use of Binary Search**: The official solution utilizes the `bisect` module to efficiently find the position to insert elements in the `dp` array, which keeps track of the smallest tail values of increasing subsequences. This allows for O(log n) complexity when updating the LIS, making the overall approach more efficient.\n\n2. **DFS Implementation**: The DFS function is designed to traverse the tree while maintaining the state of the `dp` array. It updates the LIS dynamically as it explores each vertex, which is a more elegant solution than collecting paths and then calculating the LIS afterward.\n\n3. **State Management**: The use of a `changes` list to backtrack the modifications made to the `dp` array during the DFS traversal is a clever way to ensure that the state is restored correctly after exploring each vertex.\n\n4. **Initialization and Edge Handling**: The official solution initializes the graph and the necessary data structures in a straightforward manner, ensuring that all vertices are accounted for and that the traversal starts from vertex 1.\n\n### Comparison with My Approach:\n- My approach involved a straightforward DFS to find paths and then compute the LIS separately, which resulted in higher time complexity due to the repeated LIS calculations.\n- The official solution's method of integrating LIS calculation into the DFS traversal is more efficient and elegant, reducing the overall complexity significantly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis experience highlighted the importance of considering more advanced data structures and algorithms, such as binary search, when dealing with problems involving sequences and subsequences. The official solution serves as a valuable reference for future problems of a similar nature, emphasizing the need for efficiency in both time and space complexity."

It first initializes the graph based on the input, where each vertex is connected by edges. For each vertex, it performs a depth-first search to find the path from the starting vertex to the current vertex. The values corresponding to the vertices in the found path are extracted, and the length of the longest increasing subsequence of these values is calculated. Finally, it prints the length of the longest increasing subsequence for each vertex. The function effectively combines graph traversal with subsequence analysis.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios involving tree data structures where one needs to analyze paths between nodes. It can be applied in various fields such as computer science for algorithm design, data analysis for finding patterns in sequences, and in competitive programming where problems involve finding increasing subsequences in paths of trees. Understanding how to efficiently compute the longest increasing subsequence can also be beneficial in optimization problems and dynamic programming contexts."
