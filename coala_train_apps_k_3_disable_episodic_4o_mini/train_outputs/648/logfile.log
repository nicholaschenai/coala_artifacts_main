## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a series of hills, each with a specific height. Participants in a competition will jump from one hill to another based on certain rules. They can either query where they will end up after a series of jumps or modify the heights of a range of hills. The jumps can only go to the nearest hill to the right that is taller, and if there are no such hills within a distance of 100, they stay on the current hill.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will maintain a list of hill heights.
   - For each query of type 1, we will start from the specified hill and attempt to jump up to `k` times, checking the heights of the hills to the right to find the next valid jump.
   - For each query of type 2, we will update the heights of the specified range of hills by adding a given value.
   - We need to ensure that the jumps respect the distance constraint of 100 hills.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a list of hill heights from input
   For each operation:
       If operation type is 1:
           Set current position to i-1 (0-indexed)
           For j from 0 to k-1:
               Find the next hill to jump to:
                   For each hill from current position + 1 to current position + 100:
                       If hill index is out of bounds, break
                       If height of hill is greater than height of current position:
                           Update current position to this hill index
                           Break
               If no valid jump found, break
           Output the final position (current position + 1 for 1-indexing)
       Else if operation type is 2:
           Update the heights of hills from L-1 to R-1 by adding X
   ```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof at the origin (0, 0) based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). 

    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.

    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum. The approach was straightforward and worked well within the constraints provided. 

    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently handling input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. The solution utilized a linear search for counting walls, which was acceptable given the constraints, but could be optimized further with binary search if necessary. Overall, the solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0

            N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls
            index += 1
        
            walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions
            index += 1
        
            Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries
            index += 1

                index += 1
            
                sum_xy = x_j + y_j

                if sum_xy in walls:

                else:

                    count = 0
                    for wall in walls:
                        if wall > sum_xy:
                            count += 1

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves a competition where participants jump between hills of varying heights. Each participant starts at a specified hill and must jump to the nearest higher hill to the right a certain number of times. If there are no higher hills within a distance of 100 hills, the participant remains on their current hill. Additionally, there are operations to increase or decrease the heights of a range of hills.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We need to handle two types of operations:
   - For the first type, we will simulate the jumps starting from a given hill and count how many jumps can be made to higher hills, stopping if we reach the maximum number of jumps or if there are no valid hills to jump to.
   - For the second type, we will update the heights of a specified range of hills by a given amount.
   To efficiently find the nearest higher hill, we can iterate through the hills to the right of the current hill, checking their heights.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function solve():
       read N, Q
       read heights array A of size N
       
       for each operation in Q:

               jumps = 0

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] In this problem, I implemented a solution to handle a hill jumping competition where participants jump between hills based on their heights. The key operations involved were determining the final hill index after a series of jumps and updating the heights of a range of hills.

The core concepts tested included:
- Efficiently finding the nearest higher hill within a limited range (100 hills).
- Handling multiple operations on an array of heights, including both read and update operations.

The solution utilized a straightforward approach where for each jump, I iterated through the hills to the right of the current position to find the next valid hill. This was done in a while loop, which continued until the maximum number of jumps was reached or no valid hill was found. The height updates were handled with a simple loop over the specified range.

The implementation was successful, passing all provided test cases, indicating that the logic for both types of operations was correctly executed. The final code efficiently managed the operations within the constraints, demonstrating a clear understanding of array manipulation and iteration in Python. 

Key code snippet for the jump operation:
```python
while jumps < k:
    next_index = current_index + 1
    found = False
    while next_index < N and next_index <= current_index + 100:
        if A[next_index] > A[current_index]:
            current_index = next_index
            found = True
            break
        next_index += 1
    if not found:
        break
```

This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing indices and conditions when working with array-based problems, especially in competitive programming contexts.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is going to organize a hill jumping competition and he is going to be one of the judges in it. In this competition there are N hills in a row, and the initial height of i-th hill is Ai. Participants are required to demonstrate their jumping skills by doing what the judges tell them.
Judges will give each participant a card which has two numbers, i and k, which means that the participant should start at the i-th hill and jump k times, where one jump should be from the current hill to the nearest hill to the right which is strictly higher (in height) than the current one. If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

-----Input-----
- First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
- Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
- Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

-----Output-----
For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
- 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
- -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
- 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
- Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

-----Example-----
Input:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
1 1 2
2 3 4 -1
1 1 2

Output:
3
4

-----Explanation-----
The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 648 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves a competition where participants jump between hills of varying heights. Each participant starts at a specified hill and must jump to the nearest higher hill to the right a certain number of times. If there are no higher hills within a distance of 100 hills, the participant remains on their current hill. Additionally, there are operations to increase or decrease the heights of a range of hills.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We need to handle two types of operations:
   - For the first type, we will simulate the jumps starting from a given hill and count how many jumps can be made to higher hills, stopping if we reach the maximum number of jumps or if there are no valid hills to jump to.
   - For the second type, we will update the heights of a specified range of hills by a given amount.
   To efficiently find the nearest higher hill, we can iterate through the hills to the right of the current hill, checking their heights.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function solve():
       read N, Q
       read heights array A of size N

INFO - [Task id] 648 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem with a straightforward approach that closely mirrors my own implementation, but with some differences in structure and clarity. Here are the key insights and observations:

1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses a single read for the input, which can be more efficient than reading line by line. This approach minimizes the overhead of multiple I/O operations.

2. **Jump Logic**: The jump logic is similar in both solutions, where the algorithm iterates through the hills to find the nearest higher hill. However, the official solution uses a more compact loop structure, which makes it easier to follow. It uses a temporary variable `temp` to track whether a jump was made, which simplifies the exit condition of the inner loop.

3. **Index Management**: The official solution handles index adjustments (1-based to 0-based) directly within the loop, which can make the code cleaner. For example, it adjusts the starting index for jumps directly when reading input, rather than converting it later.

4. **Output Handling**: The final results are collected in a list and printed in one go at the end, which is generally more efficient than printing each result immediately, especially in a competitive programming context.

5. **Efficiency**: Both solutions have similar time complexity, but the official solution's compactness and clarity may make it easier to maintain and understand. The use of a single loop for both types of operations also reduces redundancy.

Overall, while my solution was correct and passed the provided test cases, the official solution demonstrates a more efficient and cleaner approach to handling input and managing the jump logic. In future implementations, I should consider consolidating input handling and output processes to improve efficiency and readability.

If there is no such hill or its distance (i.e. difference between their indices)  is more than 100 then the participant should remain in his current hill.
    Please help Chef by creating a program to use it during the competitions. It should read the initial heights of the hill and should support two kinds of operations:
    Type 1: Given a two numbers: i and k, your program should output the index of the hill the participant is expected to finish if he starts from the i-th hill (as explained above).
    Type 2: Given three numbers: L, R, X, the heights of all the hills between L and R, both end points inclusive, should be increased by X (if X is negative then their height is decreased).

    -----Input-----
    - First line contains two integers N and Q, denoting the number of hills and number of operations respectively.
    - Second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the initial heights of the hills.
    - Each of the next Q lines describes an operation. If the first integer is equal to 1, it means that the operation is of Type 1, and it will be followed by two integers i and k. Otherwise the first number will be equal to 2, and it means that the operation is of Type 2, and so it will be followed by three integers L, R and X.

    -----Output-----
    For each operation of Type 1, output the index of the hill in which the participant will finish.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 100,000
    - 1 â‰¤ Ai â‰¤ 1,000,000
    - 1 â‰¤ L â‰¤ R â‰¤ N
    - -1,000,000 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 1,000,000
    - 1 â‰¤ i, k â‰¤ N

    -----Subtasks-----
    - Subtask 1 (20 points) : 1 â‰¤ N, Q â‰¤ 1,000 
    - Subtask 2 (80 points) : Original constraints

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    5 3
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 1 2
    2 3 4 -1
    1 1 2

    Output:
    3
    4

    -----Explanation-----
    The initial heights are (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The first operation is of Type 1 and starts from Hill 1 and wants to jump twice. The first jump will be to Hill 2, and the second jump will be to Hill 3. Hence the output for this is 3.
    The second operation changes the heights to (1, 2, 2, 3, 5).
    The last operation starts from Hill 1. The first jump is to Hill 2. But the next jump will skip Hill 3 (because it's height is not strictly greater than the current hill's height), and will go to Hill 4. Hence the output is 4.
