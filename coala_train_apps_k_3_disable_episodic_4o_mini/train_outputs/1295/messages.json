The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values.

The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.\n\n    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.\n\n    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python.
