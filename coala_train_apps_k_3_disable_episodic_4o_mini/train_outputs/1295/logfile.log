[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


" Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to calculate a sum based on Fibonacci numbers for multiple queries. Each query provides two numbers, N and K, and we need to compute the sum of the first K Fibonacci numbers starting from the N-th Fibonacci number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined such that F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and for any i >= 2, F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2).
   - For each query, we need to find the N-th Fibonacci number and then sum the next K Fibonacci numbers starting from F(N).
   - Given the constraints (N and K can be as large as 10^18), we cannot compute Fibonacci numbers directly using a simple iterative or recursive approach due to time and space limitations.
   - Instead, we can use matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently in logarithmic time.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.

   The task is to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, but only including every Kth Fibonacci number in that range. This needs to be done for multiple queries, where each query specifies different values of N and K.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:

   - For each query, sum the Fibonacci numbers starting from the 0th up to the Nth, but only include every Kth number in that sum.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, but only including every Kth Fibonacci number in that range. This needs to be done for multiple queries, where each query specifies different values of N and K.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Generate Fibonacci numbers up to the Nth number.
   - For each query, sum the Fibonacci numbers starting from the 0th up to the Nth, but only include every Kth number in that sum.
   - Since N can be very large (up to 10^18), we need to be careful about how we generate Fibonacci numbers and compute the sums efficiently.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers from the 0th to the Nth Fibonacci number, including only every Kth Fibonacci number for multiple queries. The challenge was to handle potentially very large values for N and K (up to 10^18), which required careful consideration of efficiency in both Fibonacci number generation and summation.

The initial approach involved using an iterative method to compute Fibonacci numbers, which worked well for smaller values of N. However, the naive summation approach would be inefficient for large N due to the sheer number of Fibonacci calculations required. 

The final solution implemented a straightforward iterative Fibonacci calculation and a loop to sum the relevant Fibonacci numbers based on the Kth index. While this worked for small inputs, it would not scale well for the upper limits of the constraints. 

Key takeaways include the importance of optimizing Fibonacci calculations, possibly through memoization or matrix exponentiation for larger inputs, and the need to consider the efficiency of summation methods when dealing with high constraints. 

Here’s the core code snippet for reference:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b

def S(N, K):
    sum_fib = 0
    for i in range(0, N + 1):
        if i % K == 0:
            sum_fib += fibonacci(i)
    return sum_fib
``` 

Future improvements could focus on optimizing the Fibonacci calculation for large N and exploring more efficient summation techniques.

INFO - [Task id] 1295 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute the sum of Fibonacci numbers, particularly for large values of N and K, which can go up to 10^18. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Matrix Exponentiation for Fibonacci Calculation**: The official solution uses a method based on matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers in logarithmic time. This is significantly faster than the iterative approach I initially used, especially for large N. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using matrix multiplication, allowing for efficient computation.

2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The solution incorporates modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. This is crucial given the constraints, as results need to be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: Instead of summing Fibonacci numbers directly for every Kth index, the official solution uses a mathematical formula to compute the sum efficiently. It leverages properties of geometric series and modular inverses to derive the result without iterating through all Fibonacci numbers.

4. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution is designed to handle the maximum constraints effectively, ensuring that operations remain efficient even for the upper limits of N and K.

5. **Key Functions**:
   - `fibonacci(n)`: Computes the nth Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.
   - `inv(n)`: Computes the modular inverse, which is essential for division in modular arithmetic.
   - `ans(n, k)`: Combines the above functions to compute the required sum efficiently.

In summary, the official solution is superior due to its use of matrix exponentiation for Fibonacci calculation and its efficient handling of large inputs through modular arithmetic and mathematical properties. This experience highlights the importance of optimizing algorithms for competitive programming, especially when dealing with large constraints.

It first reads the number of queries and then iterates through each query to extract the values of N and K. For each query, it computes the required sum using another function and stores the results. Finally, it outputs all the computed sums for each query. The function handles input directly from the standard input and prints the results sequentially. It efficiently manages multiple calculations in a single execution.

[Problem]
    In the year 4242, the language Haskell has evolved so much that it has become an AI. It can solve very challenging problems, in very little time. Humanity is worried that Haskell will take over the world. All hopes remain tied to the Competitive Programming community as they are the expert in shaving milliseconds off code runtime. Haskell creators have found one particular task that if solved faster than Haskell itself, can be used to hack into Haskell's codebase and thus defeat it. The exact details of the task are as follows,


    " Calculate the sum, S(N, K) = , for Q queries. Here Fi is ith Fibonacci number defined as: Fi = i if i = 0 or 1 and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 if i >= 2. "


    You being a member of the Competitive Programming community are encouraged to make a submission to this task.

    -----Input-----

    The first line contains a single integer Q, the number of queries.

    Each of the next Q lines contain two integers each, Ni and Ki.

    -----Output-----

    Output Q lines with one integer each. The ith line should contain the value S(Ni, Ki).

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1 <= Q <= 5*104
    - 1 <= N <= 1018
    - 1 <= K <= 1018

    -----Example-----
    Input:
    1
    1 1
    Output:
    1
