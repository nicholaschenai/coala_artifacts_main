He ordered $N$ apples, where $N$ is a multiple of $K$. Now, he just needs to hire someone who will distribute the apples into the boxes with professional passion. \nOnly two candidates passed all the interviews for the box filling job. In one minute, each candidate can put $K$ apples into boxes, but they do it in different ways: the first candidate puts exactly one apple in each box, while the second one chooses a random box with the smallest number of apples and puts $K$ apples in it.\nChef is wondering if the final distribution of apples can even depend on which candidate he hires. Can you answer that question?\nNote: The boxes are distinguishable (labeled), while the apples are not. Therefore, two distributions of apples are different if there is a box such that the number of apples in it when the first candidate finishes working can be different from the number of apples in it when the second candidate finishes working.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$. \n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \"YES\" if the final distributions of apples can be different or \"NO\" if they will be the same (without quotes).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\le T \\le 250$\n- $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^{18}$\n- $N$ is divisible by $K$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (30 points): $1 \\le N, K \\le 10^5$\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\n5 1\n4 2\n10 10\n\n-----Example Output-----\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: No matter who is hired, all apples will be in the only box at the end.\nExample case 2: At the end, there will be two apples in each box.\nExample case 3: If we hire the first candidate, there will be one apple in each box, but if we hire the second one, there will be $10$ apples in one box and none in all other boxes.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

There are two candidates who can help with this task. The first candidate distributes the apples evenly, putting one apple in each box until all apples are distributed. The second candidate puts all K apples into the box that currently has the least number of apples. The question is whether the final distribution of apples in the boxes can be different depending on which candidate is hired.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To determine if the final distributions can differ, we need to analyze how each candidate distributes the apples:\n   - The first candidate will always distribute the apples evenly across all boxes, resulting in each box having the same number of apples.\n   - The second candidate, however, may end up putting all apples into one box if K equals N, or may distribute them unevenly if K is less than N. \n   Therefore, if K equals N, the second candidate will fill one box completely, while the first candidate will distribute them evenly. In all other cases, if K is less than N, the distributions will be the same because both candidates will end up filling the boxes in a way that results in the same number of apples in each box.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Read the number of test cases T\n   For each test case:\n       Read N and K\n       If K == N:\n           Print \"YES\" (distributions can be different)\n       Else:\n           Print \"NO\" (distributions will be the same)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n\n# Iterate through each test case\nfor _ in range(T):\n    # Read N and K\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    # Check if K is equal to N\n    if K == N:\n        # If K equals N, the distributions can be different\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, the distributions will be the same\n        print(\"NO\")\n```"

The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money to a group of minions such that he ends up with exactly zero money left. The key concepts involved were understanding the total demand from the minions and ensuring that each individual demand could be satisfied without exceeding the amount of money Gru had at any point.\n\n    Initially, the approach was to simply check if the total demand equaled the amount of money Gru had. However, this was insufficient because it did not account for the individual demands of the minions. The correct approach required checking both the total demand and ensuring that each individual demand was less than or equal to the money Gru had.\n\n    The final solution involved calculating the total demand and checking if it matched Gru's total money. If it did, the output was \"YES\"; otherwise, it was \"NO\". However, the solution failed to pass the tests because it did not consider the scenario where the total demand could be less than Gru's money but still not allow for exact distribution.\n\n    The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of considering both aggregate and individual constraints when solving distribution problems. The final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Extract number of minions and amount of money Gru has\n            A = case[2]  # Extract the list of demands from minions\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)  # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by minions\n        \n            # Check if the total demand equals the money Gru has\n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")  # Gru can distribute the money exactly\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")  # Gru cannot distribute the money as required\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the need for careful consideration of problem constraints and the importance of validating both total and individual conditions in distribution scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.\n\n    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.\n\n    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.\n\n    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Read number of boxes and capacity of each box\n            ducks = case[2]  # Read the list of duck counts\n            boxes = []  # This will hold the distribution of ducks in each box\n        \n            # Create a list of colors with their counts\n            color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]\n        \n            # Fill each box\n            for _ in range(N):\n                m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box\n                c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box\n            \n                # Try to fill the box with ducks\n                for i in range(len(color_counts)):\n                    if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full\n                        if color_counts[i][1] > 0:  # If there are ducks of this color\n                            if c1 == -1:  # First color\n                                c1 = color_counts[i][0]\n                                m1 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible\n                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m1)  # Update count\n                            elif c2 == -1:  # Second color\n                                c2 = color_counts[i][0]\n                                m2 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible\n                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m2)  # Update count\n            \n                # If we have only one color, ensure the other is set to 0\n                if c2 == -1:\n                    c2 = 0\n                    m2 = 0\n            \n                # Append the box configuration\n                boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))\n        \n            # Output the boxes\n            for box in boxes:\n                print(box[0], box[1], box[2], box[3])\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the challenges faced, and the final solution that met all requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
