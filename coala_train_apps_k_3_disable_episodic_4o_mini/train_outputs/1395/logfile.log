## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

-----Example Input-----

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Ram and Shyam have distinct roll numbers, and they receive different sets of questions based on their roll numbers. We need to determine how many different values of `p` (the number of question sets) allow them to receive the same set of questions. If there are infinitely many such values, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the values of `p` for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, we need to check when the modulo operation on their roll numbers results in the same value. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   (A - 1) \% p = (B - 1) \% p
   \]
   This can be simplified to:
   \[
   (A - B) \% p = 0
   \]
   This means that `p` must be a divisor of the absolute difference between `A` and `B`. If `A` equals `B`, they will always receive the same set of questions for any positive `p`, leading to an infinite number of values. If `A` is not equal to `B`, we can find the number of divisors of the absolute difference.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_divisors(n):
       count = 0
       for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
           if n % i == 0:
               count += 1
               if i != n / i:
                   count += 1
       return count

   function find_cheating_values(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           A, B = test_case
           if A == B:
               print(-1)
           else:
               difference = abs(A - B)

   ```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.

    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.

    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def largest_prime_factor(n):
        largest_prime = 1
        while n % 2 == 0:
            largest_prime = 2
            n //= 2
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            while n % i == 0:
                largest_prime = i
                n //= i
        if n > 2:
            largest_prime = n
        return largest_prime

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        index = 1
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))
            index += 1
        
            prime_count = {}
        
            for number in elements:
                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)
                if largest_prime in prime_count:
                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1
                else:
                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1
        
            max_count = -1
            result_prime = -1
        
            for prime, count in prime_count.items():
                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result_prime):
                    max_count = count
                    result_prime = prime
        
            results.append(result_prime)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Ram and Shyam have roll numbers A and B, respectively. They will receive the same set of exam questions if the modulo operation of their roll numbers with respect to the number of question sets (p) yields the same result. We need to determine how many values of p allow them to receive the same set of questions, or if there are infinitely many such values.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the values of p for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, we need to check when the results of the modulo operation for their roll numbers are equal. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   (A - 1) \% p = (B - 1) \% p
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   (A - B) \% p = 0
   \]
   This means that p must be a divisor of the absolute difference between A and B. If A equals B, they will always receive the same set of questions for any p (infinite solutions). If A is not equal to B, we can count the divisors of the absolute difference to find the number of valid p values.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```

       count = 0

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Ram and Shyam have roll numbers A and B, respectively. They will receive the same set of exam questions if the modulo operation of their roll numbers with respect to the number of question sets (p) yields the same result. We need to determine how many values of p allow them to receive the same set of questions, or if there are infinitely many such values.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the values of p for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, we need to check when the results of the modulo operation for their roll numbers are equal. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   (A - 1) \% p = (B - 1) \% p
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   (A - B) \% p = 0
   \]
   This means that p must be a divisor of the absolute difference between A and B. If A equals B, they will always receive the same set of questions for any p (infinite solutions). If A is not equal to B, we can count the divisors of the absolute difference to find the number of valid p values.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function count_divisors(n):
       count = 0
       for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
           if n % i == 0:
               count += 1

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
- The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
- If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

-----Example Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of p allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers A and B. The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.

The solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.

The final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. 

Key code snippet for counting divisors:
```python
def count_divisors(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            if i != n // i:
                count += 1
    return count
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.

  print(count)

INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by leveraging the properties of divisors and bitwise operations. Here are the key insights:

1. **Bitwise Comparison for Equality**: The official solution uses the expression `if not(A^B)` to check if A and B are equal. This is a clever use of the XOR operator, which returns 0 when both numbers are the same. This approach is efficient and concise compared to a direct equality check.

2. **Divisor Counting**: The method for counting divisors is similar to my approach, where it iterates up to the square root of the difference between A and B. This is optimal because any divisor larger than the square root would have a corresponding smaller divisor that has already been counted.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution correctly handles the case where A equals B by printing -1, indicating infinite solutions. This is crucial for ensuring the output is accurate.

4. **Efficiency**: The overall time complexity remains O(âˆšn) for counting divisors, which is efficient given the constraints. The use of integer division and careful checks for perfect squares ensures that the counting is accurate without unnecessary computations.

In summary, the official solution is efficient and concise, utilizing bitwise operations for equality checks and maintaining optimal divisor counting logic. My approach was similar but could have benefited from the bitwise check for clarity and brevity.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 1395 [generation text] This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, A and B. It first checks if A and B are equal, in which case it appends -1 to the results list, indicating infinite solutions. If they are not equal, it calculates the absolute difference between A and B and counts the number of divisors of this difference. The results for each test case are collected in a list and then printed line by line. This allows for efficient processing and output of the results for all test cases at once.

[Problem]
    Ram and Shyam are sitting next to each other, hoping to cheat on an exam. However, the examination board has prepared $p$ different sets of questions (numbered $0$ through $p-1$), which will be distributed to the students in the following way:
    - The students are assigned roll numbers â€” pairwise distinct positive integers.
    - If a student's roll number is $r$, this student gets the $((r-1)\%p)$-th set of questions.
    Obviously, Ram and Shyam can cheat only if they get the same set of questions.
    You are given the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam: $A$ and $B$ respectively. Find the number of values of $p$ for which they can cheat, or determine that there is an infinite number of such values.

    -----Input-----
    - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
    - The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $A$ and $B$.

    -----Output-----
    For each test case, print a single line â€” the number of values of $p$ for which Ram and Shyam can cheat, or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such values.

    -----Constraints-----
    - $1 \le T \le 100$
    - $1 \le A, B \le 10^8$

    -----Example Input-----
    1
    2 6

    -----Example Output-----
    3

    -----Explanation-----
    Example case 1: They can cheat for $p = 1$, $p = 2$ or $p = 4$.
