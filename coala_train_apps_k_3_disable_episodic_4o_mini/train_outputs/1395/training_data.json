    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine how many values of p allow two students, Ram and Shyam, to receive the same set of exam questions based on their roll numbers A and B. The key insight was that they would receive the same set if the difference between their roll numbers (A - B) is divisible by p. If A equals B, there are infinitely many values of p, otherwise, the task reduces to counting the divisors of the absolute difference.\n\nThe solution involved creating a function to count the divisors of a number, which iterates up to the square root of the number to efficiently find all divisors. The main function reads multiple test cases, checks for equality of A and B, and either returns -1 for infinite solutions or counts the divisors for the absolute difference.\n\nThe final implementation was straightforward and passed all test cases, demonstrating a clear understanding of modular arithmetic and divisor counting. The approach was efficient given the constraints, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. \n\nKey code snippet for counting divisors:\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            if i != n // i:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n``` \n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical properties related to divisibility and modular arithmetic in problem-solving.",
    "reflection": "The official solution effectively addresses the problem by leveraging the properties of divisors and bitwise operations. Here are the key insights:\n\n1. **Bitwise Comparison for Equality**: The official solution uses the expression `if not(A^B)` to check if A and B are equal. This is a clever use of the XOR operator, which returns 0 when both numbers are the same. This approach is efficient and concise compared to a direct equality check.\n\n2. **Divisor Counting**: The method for counting divisors is similar to my approach, where it iterates up to the square root of the difference between A and B. This is optimal because any divisor larger than the square root would have a corresponding smaller divisor that has already been counted.\n\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution correctly handles the case where A equals B by printing -1, indicating infinite solutions. This is crucial for ensuring the output is accurate.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The overall time complexity remains O(\u221an) for counting divisors, which is efficient given the constraints. The use of integer division and careful checks for perfect squares ensures that the counting is accurate without unnecessary computations.\n\nIn summary, the official solution is efficient and concise, utilizing bitwise operations for equality checks and maintaining optimal divisor counting logic. My approach was similar but could have benefited from the bitwise check for clarity and brevity.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThis function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, A and B. It first checks if A and B are equal, in which case it appends -1 to the results list, indicating infinite solutions. If they are not equal, it calculates the absolute difference between A and B and counts the number of divisors of this difference. The results for each test case are collected in a list and then printed line by line. This allows for efficient processing and output of the results for all test cases at once.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine the conditions under which two individuals can receive the same set of questions based on their roll numbers in a modular arithmetic context. It can be applied in competitive programming, algorithm design, and problem-solving situations where understanding divisors and modular relationships is crucial. Additionally, it can help in educational settings where students are learning about number theory and its applications in real-world problems."
