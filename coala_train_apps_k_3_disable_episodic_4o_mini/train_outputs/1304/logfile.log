## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1
3 1 2

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order for a given list of permutations of numbers from 1 to N. We will be provided with multiple permutations, and for each one, we need to compute and print the next permutation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the next permutation, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify the longest suffix that is in descending order. This means we need to find the rightmost pair of elements where the first element is less than the second.
   - If such a pair is found, we will swap the first element of this pair with the smallest element in the suffix that is larger than it.
   - Finally, we reverse the suffix to get the next permutation in lexicographic order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function next_permutation(arr):
       find the largest index i such that arr[i] < arr[i + 1]
       if no such index exists, reverse arr and return
       find the largest index j greater than i such that arr[i] < arr[j]
       swap arr[i] and arr[j]
       reverse the sequence from arr[i + 1] to the end of arr

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts for Permutation Problem

    The task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the function \( f(P) \) equals a given integer \( K \). The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a permutation of size \( N \) is \( N(N-1)/2 \).

    #### Key Insights:
    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \( f(P) \) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \( K \) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.
    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \( f(P) \)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \( K \) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.

    #### Issues Encountered:
    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \( K \). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.
    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.

    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:
    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.
    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.

    #### Final Code Snippet:
    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \( K \). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.

    ```python
    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
            if K > max_value:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                # Start with descending order
                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                current_sum = max_value
            
                # Adjust the permutation to reach K
                for i in range(N - 1):
                    if current_sum == K:
                        break
                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K
                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)
                    if max_reduce > 0:
                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce
                        current_sum -= max_reduce
            
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
        print("\n".join(map(str, results)))
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. 

    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach of generating all possible strings by removing and reinserting characters was effective, and the use of comparisons to track the smallest string worked as intended.

    The final implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each string, and outputting the results. The code was structured to first define the main function and then handle input/output, ensuring clarity and separation of logic. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. 

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    for i in range(N):  # Iterate through each character
        char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to move
        remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remove the character
        for j in range(N):  # Try to insert the character at every position
            new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]
            if new_string < smallest_string:  # Check if the new string is smaller
                smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of string manipulation techniques and careful iteration when solving combinatorial problems.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The approach involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the current arrangement, as the books not in this subsequence would need to be moved.

    The solution utilized a dynamic programming technique to compute the LIS. The key steps included initializing an array to track the lengths of increasing subsequences and iterating through the books to update these lengths based on comparisons. The final result was derived by subtracting the length of the LIS from the total number of books.

    The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test case. The main takeaway is the effectiveness of the LIS approach in minimizing moves for sorting problems, which can be applied to similar scenarios involving permutations and orderings. 

    Hereâ€™s the core code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
        lis = [1] * N
        for i in range(1, N):
            for j in range(i):
                if books[i] > books[j]:
                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)
        longest_increasing_length = max(lis)
        return N - longest_increasing_length

    N = int(input())
    books = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))
    ``` 

    This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

-----Output:-----
The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
- $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

-----Sample input-----
3 2
3 1 2
2 3 1

-----Sample output-----
3 2 1
3 1 2

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to find the next permutation of a given sequence of numbers from 1 to N in lexicographic order. Given multiple permutations, we need to output the next permutation for each one.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the next permutation, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify the longest suffix that is non-increasing (i.e., find the rightmost pair where the first number is less than the second).
   - If such a pair is found, swap the first number of this pair with the smallest number in the suffix that is larger than it.
   - Finally, reverse the suffix to get the next permutation in lexicographic order.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function next_permutation(arr):
       find the largest index i such that arr[i] < arr[i + 1]
       if no such index exists, reverse arr and return

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.

    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] In this task, I implemented a solution to find the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concept involved identifying the rightmost ascent in the permutation, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.

The implementation followed a clear structure: a helper function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution successfully handled multiple permutations as specified in the problem statement.

One key takeaway is the importance of understanding the mechanics of generating permutations, particularly the lexicographic order. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. The code was tested against sample inputs, and it produced the expected outputs, confirming its correctness. 

Hereâ€™s the essential code snippet for future reference:

```python
def next_permutation(arr):
    i = len(arr) - 2
    while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i == -1:
        arr.reverse()
        return arr
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while arr[j] <= arr[i]:
        j -= 1
    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
    arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])
    return arr

def main():
    N, K = map(int, input().split())
    results = []
    for _ in range(K):
        permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))
        next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)
        results.append(" ".join(map(str, next_perm)))
    print("\n".join(results))

main()
```

INFO - [Task id] 1304 [generation text] The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next lexicographic permutation of a sequence. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:

1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This is a good practice for competitive programming as it simplifies the main logic and improves readability.

2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`. This is crucial because it identifies the point where the order can be changed to create the next permutation.

3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible permutation that is larger than the current one.

4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After swapping the pivot with the identified successor, the solution sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This step is efficient because it guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.

5. **Output**: The results are printed in a single line using unpacking, which is a concise way to format the output.

Overall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a clear understanding of the permutation generation process. My initial approach was similar but could have benefited from a more structured input handling and clearer separation of the steps involved in finding the next permutation. The official solution's use of sorting the suffix after the swap is a particularly effective way to ensure correctness without additional complexity.

[Problem]
    It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
    However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
    123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
    The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

    -----Output:-----
    The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
    - $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

    -----Sample input-----
    3 2
    3 1 2
    2 3 1

    -----Sample output-----
    3 2 1
    3 1 2
