However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.\nHowever, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:\n123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \\, 2 \\, 3 \\quad    1 \\, 3 \\, 2 \\quad     2 \\, 1 \\, 3 \\quad     2 \\, 3 \\, 1 \\quad     3 \\, 1 \\, 2 \\quad     3 \\, 2 \\, 1 \nThe problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, \u2026, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,\u2026,N$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nThe output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$.\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 10$.\n\n-----Sample input-----\n3 2\n3 1 2\n2 3 1\n\n-----Sample output-----\n3 2 1\n3 1 2\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\).\n\n    #### Key Insights:\n    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \\( f(P) \\) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \\( K \\) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.\n    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \\( f(P) \\)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \\( K \\) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.\n\n    #### Issues Encountered:\n    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \\( K \\). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.\n    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.\n\n    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:\n    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.\n    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet:\n    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \\( K \\). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                # Start with descending order\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_sum = max_value\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to reach K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_sum == K:\n                        break\n                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K\n                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)\n                    if max_reduce > 0:\n                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce\n                        current_sum -= max_reduce\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n        print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. \n\n    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach of generating all possible strings by removing and reinserting characters was effective, and the use of comparisons to track the smallest string worked as intended.\n\n    The final implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each string, and outputting the results. The code was structured to first define the main function and then handle input/output, ensuring clarity and separation of logic. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. \n\n    Key code snippet:\n    ```python\n    for i in range(N):  # Iterate through each character\n        char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to move\n        remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remove the character\n        for j in range(N):  # Try to insert the character at every position\n            new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]\n            if new_string < smallest_string:  # Check if the new string is smaller\n                smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of string manipulation techniques and careful iteration when solving combinatorial problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The approach involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the current arrangement, as the books not in this subsequence would need to be moved.\n\n    The solution utilized a dynamic programming technique to compute the LIS. The key steps included initializing an array to track the lengths of increasing subsequences and iterating through the books to update these lengths based on comparisons. The final result was derived by subtracting the length of the LIS from the total number of books.\n\n    The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test case. The main takeaway is the effectiveness of the LIS approach in minimizing moves for sorting problems, which can be applied to similar scenarios involving permutations and orderings. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n        lis = [1] * N\n        for i in range(1, N):\n            for j in range(i):\n                if books[i] > books[j]:\n                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)\n        longest_increasing_length = max(lis)\n        return N - longest_increasing_length\n\n    N = int(input())\n    books = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))\n    ``` \n\n    This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
