    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to find the next permutation of a given sequence of numbers from 1 to N in lexicographic order. Given multiple permutations, we need to output the next permutation for each one.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the next permutation, we can follow these steps:\n   - Identify the longest suffix that is non-increasing (i.e., find the rightmost pair where the first number is less than the second).\n   - If such a pair is found, swap the first number of this pair with the smallest number in the suffix that is larger than it.\n   - Finally, reverse the suffix to get the next permutation in lexicographic order.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function next_permutation(arr):\n       find the largest index i such that arr[i] < arr[i + 1]\n       if no such index exists, reverse arr and return\n       find the largest index j greater than i such that arr[i] < arr[j]\n       swap arr[i] and arr[j]\n       reverse the sequence from arr[i + 1] to the end of arr\n\n   function main():\n       read N and K\n       for each permutation:\n           call next_permutation on the permutation\n           print the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef next_permutation(arr):\n    # Step 1: Find the largest index i such that arr[i] < arr[i + 1]\n    i = len(arr) - 2\n    while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    \n    # If no such index exists, the permutation is the last one\n    if i == -1:\n        arr.reverse()\n        return arr\n    \n    # Step 2: Find the largest index j greater than i such that arr[i] < arr[j]\n    j = len(arr) - 1\n    while arr[j] <= arr[i]:\n        j -= 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Swap arr[i] and arr[j]\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    \n    # Step 4: Reverse the sequence from arr[i + 1] to the end of arr\n    arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])\n    return arr\n\ndef main():\n    # Read N and K\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    results = []\n    \n    # Read each permutation and find the next permutation\n    for _ in range(K):\n        permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)\n        results.append(\" \".join(map(str, next_perm)))\n    \n    # Print all results\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n# Call the main function to execute the program\nmain()\n```",
