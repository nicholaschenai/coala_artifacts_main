    "summary": "In this task, I implemented a solution to find the next permutation of a sequence of numbers in lexicographic order. The core concept involved identifying the rightmost ascent in the permutation, swapping elements, and reversing the suffix to generate the next permutation. This approach is efficient and works well within the constraints provided.\n\nThe implementation followed a clear structure: a helper function `next_permutation` to handle the permutation logic and a `main` function to manage input and output. The solution successfully handled multiple permutations as specified in the problem statement.\n\nOne key takeaway is the importance of understanding the mechanics of generating permutations, particularly the lexicographic order. The solution was straightforward, and no unexpected errors occurred during the implementation. The code was tested against sample inputs, and it produced the expected outputs, confirming its correctness. \n\nHere\u2019s the essential code snippet for future reference:\n\n```python\ndef next_permutation(arr):\n    i = len(arr) - 2\n    while i >= 0 and arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]:\n        i -= 1\n    if i == -1:\n        arr.reverse()\n        return arr\n    j = len(arr) - 1\n    while arr[j] <= arr[i]:\n        j -= 1\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    arr[i + 1:] = reversed(arr[i + 1:])\n    return arr\n\ndef main():\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(K):\n        permutation = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)\n        results.append(\" \".join(map(str, next_perm)))\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nmain()\n``` \n\nThis summary encapsulates the problem-solving process and the solution's structure, which can be useful for similar tasks in the future.",
    "reflection": "The official solution effectively implements the algorithm to find the next lexicographic permutation of a sequence. Here are the key insights and steps that stand out:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The official solution uses helper functions to read input efficiently. This is a good practice for competitive programming as it simplifies the main logic and improves readability.\n\n2. **Finding the Pivot**: The solution iterates through the array in reverse to find the first index `i` where `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`. This is crucial because it identifies the point where the order can be changed to create the next permutation.\n\n3. **Finding the Successor**: Once the pivot is found, the solution looks for the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the array after the pivot) that is larger than `arr[i]`. This ensures that the next permutation is the smallest possible permutation that is larger than the current one.\n\n4. **Swapping and Sorting**: After swapping the pivot with the identified successor, the solution sorts the suffix to ensure it is in the lowest possible order. This step is efficient because it guarantees that the next permutation is indeed the next in lexicographic order.\n\n5. **Output**: The results are printed in a single line using unpacking, which is a concise way to format the output.\n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging a clear understanding of the permutation generation process. My initial approach was similar but could have benefited from a more structured input handling and clearer separation of the steps involved in finding the next permutation. The official solution's use of sorting the suffix after the swap is a particularly effective way to ensure correctness without additional complexity.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: main]\nThis function reads two integers, N and K, from input, where N represents the size of permutations and K indicates the number of permutations to process. It then iterates K times, reading each permutation as a list of integers. For each permutation, it computes the next lexicographical permutation using a specific algorithm and stores the result. Finally, it prints all the computed next permutations, each on a new line.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to generate permutations in a systematic way, particularly in applications involving combinatorial algorithms, scheduling problems, or generating test cases for algorithms that require permutations. It can also be applied in competitive programming where finding the next permutation efficiently is crucial for solving problems related to arrangements or sequences. Additionally, understanding how to generate the next permutation can help in optimizing algorithms that rely on exhaustive search methods by reducing the number of permutations that need to be generated and checked."
