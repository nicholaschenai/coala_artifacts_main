The solution required parsing the string while managing nested structures, which is a common pattern in problems involving brackets.\n\n    The approach utilized a stack to keep track of the current string and the repeat count. As we iterated through the string, we built numbers for repeat counts, pushed the current state onto the stack when encountering `[`, and popped from the stack to construct the final string when encountering `]`. This method effectively handled nested encodings.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. Key concepts included managing state with a stack and handling string concatenation efficiently. The solution demonstrated the importance of careful parsing and state management in problems involving nested structures. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n            stack = []\n            current_string = \"\"\n            number = 0\n        \n            for char in s:\n                if char.isdigit():\n                    number = number * 10 + int(char)\n                elif char == '[':\n                    stack.append((current_string, number))\n                    current_string = \"\"\n                    number = 0\n                elif char == ']':\n                    last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                    current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n                else:\n                    current_string += char\n        \n            return current_string\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the utility of stacks in managing nested structures and the importance of careful iteration and state management in string manipulation tasks.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Expression parsing\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Expression parsing\n\n    A string containing a mathematical expression containing numbers and various operators is given.\n    We have to compute the value of it in $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.\n\n    The algorithm discussed here translates an expression into the so-called **reverse Polish notation** (explicitly or implicitly), and evaluates this expression.\n\n    ## Reverse Polish notation\n\n    The reverse Polish notation is a form of writing mathematical expressions, in which the operators are located after their operands.\n    For example the following expression\n\n    $$a + b * c * d + (e - f) * (g * h + i)$$\n\n    can be written in reverse Polish notation in the following way:\n\n    $$a b c * d * + e f - g h * i + * +$$\n\n    The reverse Polish notation was developed by the Australian philosopher and computer science specialist Charles Hamblin in the mid 1950s on the basis of the Polish notation, which was proposed in 1920 by the Polish mathematician Jan \u0141ukasiewicz.\n\n    The convenience of the reverse Polish notation is, that expressions in this form are very **easy to evaluate** in linear time.\n    We use a stack, which is initially empty.\n    We will iterate over the operands and operators of the expression in reverse Polish notation.\n    If the current element is a number, then we put the value on top of the stack, if the current element is an operator, then we get the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and put the result back on top of the stack.\n    In the end there will be exactly one element left in the stack, which will be the value of the expression.\n\n    Obviously this simple evaluation runs in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    ## Parsing of simple expressions\n\n    For the time being we only consider a simplified problem:\n    we assume that all operators are **binary** (i.e. they take two arguments), and all are **left-associative** (if the priorities are equal, they get executed from left to right).\n    Parentheses are allowed.\n\n    We will set up two stacks: one for numbers, and one for operators and parentheses.\n    Initially both stacks are empty.\n    For the second stack we will maintain the condition that all operations are ordered by strict descending priority.\n    If there are parenthesis on the stack, than each block of operators (corresponding to one pair of parenthesis) is ordered, and the entire stack is not necessarily ordered.\n\n    We will iterate over the characters of the expression from left to right.\n    If the current character is a digit, then we put the value of this number on the stack.\n    If the current character is an opening parenthesis, then we put it on the stack.\n    If the current character is a closing parenthesis, the we execute all operators on the stack until we reach the opening bracket (in other words we perform all operations inside the parenthesis).\n    Finally if the current character is an operator, then while the top of the stack has an operator with the same or higher priority, we will execute this operation, and put the new operation on the stack.\n\n    After we processed the entire string, some operators might still be in the stack, so we execute them.\n\n    Here is the implementation of this method for the four operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_simple}\n    bool delim(char c) {\n        return c == ' ';\n    }\n\n    bool is_op(char c) {\n        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';\n    }\n\n    int priority (char op) {\n        if (op == '+' || op == '-')\n            return 1;\n        if (op == '*' || op == '/')\n            return 2;\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {\n        int r = st.top(); st.pop();\n        int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n        switch (op) {\n            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;\n            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;\n            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;\n            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int evaluate(string& s) {\n        stack<int> st;\n        stack<char> op;\n        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {\n            if (delim(s[i]))\n                continue;\n        \n            if (s[i] == '(') {\n                op.push('(');\n            } else if (s[i] == ')') {\n                while (op.top() != '(') {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.pop();\n            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {\n                char cur_op = s[i];\n                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.push(cur_op);\n            } else {\n                int number = 0;\n                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))\n                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';\n                --i;\n                st.push(number);\n            }\n        }\n\n        while (!op.empty()) {\n            process_op(st, op.top());\n            op.pop();\n        }\n        return st.top();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.\n    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.\n\n    ## Unary operators\n\n    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).\n    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.\n\n    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.\n\n    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).\n    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.\n    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. \n\n    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.\n    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.\n\n    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.\n\n    ## Right-associativity\n\n    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.\n\n    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.\n    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \\wedge b \\wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).\n\n    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?\n    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.\n    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.\n\n    The only line that needs to be replaced is\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))\n    ```\n    with\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && (\n            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||\n            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))\n        ))\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Expression parsing\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n    where `left_assoc` is a function that decides if an operator is left_associative or not.\n\n    Here is an implementation for the binary operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$ and the unary  operators $+$ and $-$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_unary}\n    bool delim(char c) {\n        return c == ' ';\n    }\n\n    bool is_op(char c) {\n        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';\n    }\n\n    bool is_unary(char c) {\n        return c == '+' || c=='-';\n    }\n\n    int priority (char op) {\n        if (op < 0) // unary operator\n            return 3;\n        if (op == '+' || op == '-')\n            return 1;\n        if (op == '*' || op == '/')\n            return 2;\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {\n        if (op < 0) {\n            int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n            switch (-op) {\n                case '+': st.push(l); break;\n                case '-': st.push(-l); break;\n            }\n        } else {\n            int r = st.top(); st.pop();\n            int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n            switch (op) {\n                case '+': st.push(l + r); break;\n                case '-': st.push(l -

Finally, we will combine the results from the stacks to get the final answer.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate(expression):\n       initialize an empty stack for numbers\n       initialize an empty stack for operators\n       initialize a variable for the current number\n       initialize a variable for the last operator (default to '+')\n       \n       for each character in expression:\n           if character is a digit:\n               build the current number\n           if character is an operator or '(':\n               if last operator is '+':\n                   push current number onto numbers stack\n               if last operator is '-':\n                   push -current number onto numbers stack\n               if character is '(':\n                   push the last operator onto operators stack\n               reset current number\n               update last operator to current character\n           if character is ')':\n               if last operator is '+':\n                   push current number onto numbers stack\n               if last operator is '-':\n                   push -current number onto numbers stack\n               evaluate the top of the operators stack until '(' is found\n               reset current number\n       \n       after processing all characters, evaluate any remaining operators\n       return the sum of the numbers stack\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize stacks for numbers and operators\n        num_stack = []\n        op_stack = []\n        current_number = 0\n        last_operator = '+'\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the string\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            char = s[i]\n            \n            # If the character is a digit, build the current number\n            if char.isdigit():\n                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)\n            \n            # If the character is an operator or we reach the end of the string\n            if char in '+-()' or i == len(s) - 1:\n                if last_operator == '+':\n                    num_stack.append(current_number)\n                elif last_operator == '-':\n                    num_stack.append(-current_number)\n                \n                # Reset current number\n                current_number = 0\n                \n                # If the character is an operator, update last_operator\n                if char in '+-':\n                    last_operator = char\n                elif char == '(':\n                    op_stack.append(last_operator)\n                    last_operator = '+'\n                elif char == ')':\n                    # Evaluate until we find the matching '('\n                    while op_stack and op_stack[-1] != '(':\n                        op = op_stack.pop()\n                        if op == '+':\n                            num_stack.append(num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n                        elif op == '-':\n                            num_stack.append(-num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n                    op_stack.pop()  # Remove the '(' from the stack\n            \n        # Final evaluation of remaining numbers\n        while op_stack:\n            op = op_stack.pop()\n            if op == '+':\n                num_stack.append(num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n            elif op == '-':\n                num_stack.append(-num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n        \n        # Return the sum of the numbers in the stack\n        return sum(num_stack)\n```"

The core concepts involved parsing the string, managing operator precedence, and handling parentheses using a stack-based approach.\n\nThe solution involved iterating through the characters of the input string, building numbers, and managing operations based on the last encountered operator. When encountering parentheses, I pushed the current operator onto a stack and evaluated the expression inside the parentheses when a closing parenthesis was found. The final result was computed by summing the values in the number stack.\n\nThe implemented code successfully handled various test cases, including those with nested parentheses and different operator placements. The approach effectively utilized stacks to maintain the order of operations and ensure correct evaluation without using built-in evaluation functions. \n\nKey takeaways include the importance of managing state (current number and last operator) and the utility of stacks for handling nested structures like parentheses. The solution was efficient and straightforward, demonstrating a clear understanding of basic parsing and evaluation techniques."

        "content": "The official solution to the problem of evaluating a simple expression string is efficient and straightforward. It uses a single pass through the string while maintaining a running total (`res`), the current number being processed (`num`), and a sign to handle addition and subtraction. The use of a stack (`stk`) allows for handling nested parentheses effectively.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Single Pass Evaluation**: The solution processes each character in the string sequentially, which simplifies the logic and avoids the need for multiple iterations or complex state management.\n\n2. **Handling Numbers**: The solution builds multi-digit numbers by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the new digit, which is a common technique for parsing integers from strings.\n\n3. **Sign Management**: The use of a `sign` variable to track whether the current operation is addition or subtraction allows for straightforward updates to the result. This eliminates the need for separate stacks for operators.\n\n4. **Stack for Parentheses**: When encountering an opening parenthesis, the current result and sign are pushed onto the stack. Upon encountering a closing parenthesis, the result is updated by popping from the stack, which effectively handles nested expressions.\n\n5. **Final Adjustment**: After processing all characters, any remaining number is added to the result, ensuring that the last number in the expression is accounted for.\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach was more complex, involving separate stacks for numbers and operators, which could lead to more intricate logic and potential errors. The official solution's method of using a single result variable and a sign tracker is more efficient and easier to follow. \n\nOverall, the official solution is a great example of how to simplify the problem by reducing the number of data structures used and focusing on a clear, linear processing strategy. This experience reinforces the importance of clarity and efficiency in algorithm design."

        "content": "\n[description]\nThis function evaluates a mathematical expression represented as a string, handling addition, subtraction, and parentheses. It uses two stacks to manage numbers and operators while iterating through each character in the input string. When a digit is encountered, it constructs the current number, and when an operator or parenthesis is found, it processes the current number based on the last operator. The function also manages nested expressions by using a stack for operators, allowing it to correctly evaluate expressions within parentheses. After processing the entire string, it performs any remaining calculations and returns the final result as an integer. The implementation ensures that the order of operations is respected throughout the evaluation.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to evaluate mathematical expressions programmatically, such as in building a calculator application, parsing expressions in compilers, or implementing features in software that require arithmetic evaluations. It can also be applied in educational tools that help users understand the order of operations and expression evaluation. Additionally, this approach can be beneficial in data processing tasks where expressions need to be evaluated from user input or configuration files."
