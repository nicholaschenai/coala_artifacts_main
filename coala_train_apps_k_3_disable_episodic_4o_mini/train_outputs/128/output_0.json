    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a basic calculator that can evaluate a mathematical expression given as a string. The expression can include numbers, the plus (+) and minus (-) operators, parentheses for grouping, and spaces that should be ignored. The goal is to compute the result of the expression without using any built-in evaluation functions.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through the characters of the string, handling numbers, operators, and parentheses appropriately. When we encounter a number, we will build it up (in case it has multiple digits) and push it onto a stack. For operators, we will manage the order of operations using another stack. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses. Finally, we will combine the results from the stacks to get the final answer.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate(expression):\n       initialize an empty stack for numbers\n       initialize an empty stack for operators\n       initialize a variable for the current number\n       initialize a variable for the last operator (default to '+')\n       \n       for each character in expression:\n           if character is a digit:\n               build the current number\n           if character is an operator or '(':\n               if last operator is '+':\n                   push current number onto numbers stack\n               if last operator is '-':\n                   push -current number onto numbers stack\n               if character is '(':\n                   push the last operator onto operators stack\n               reset current number\n               update last operator to current character\n           if character is ')':\n               if last operator is '+':\n                   push current number onto numbers stack\n               if last operator is '-':\n                   push -current number onto numbers stack\n               evaluate the top of the operators stack until '(' is found\n               reset current number\n       \n       after processing all characters, evaluate any remaining operators\n       return the sum of the numbers stack\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n        # Initialize stacks for numbers and operators\n        num_stack = []\n        op_stack = []\n        current_number = 0\n        last_operator = '+'\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the string\n        for i in range(len(s)):\n            char = s[i]\n            \n            # If the character is a digit, build the current number\n            if char.isdigit():\n                current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)\n            \n            # If the character is an operator or we reach the end of the string\n            if char in '+-()' or i == len(s) - 1:\n                if last_operator == '+':\n                    num_stack.append(current_number)\n                elif last_operator == '-':\n                    num_stack.append(-current_number)\n                \n                # Reset current number\n                current_number = 0\n                \n                # If the character is an operator, update last_operator\n                if char in '+-':\n                    last_operator = char\n                elif char == '(':\n                    op_stack.append(last_operator)\n                    last_operator = '+'\n                elif char == ')':\n                    # Evaluate until we find the matching '('\n                    while op_stack and op_stack[-1] != '(':\n                        op = op_stack.pop()\n                        if op == '+':\n                            num_stack.append(num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n                        elif op == '-':\n                            num_stack.append(-num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n                    op_stack.pop()  # Remove the '(' from the stack\n            \n        # Final evaluation of remaining numbers\n        while op_stack:\n            op = op_stack.pop()\n            if op == '+':\n                num_stack.append(num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n            elif op == '-':\n                num_stack.append(-num_stack.pop() + num_stack.pop())\n        \n        # Return the sum of the numbers in the stack\n        return sum(num_stack)\n```",
