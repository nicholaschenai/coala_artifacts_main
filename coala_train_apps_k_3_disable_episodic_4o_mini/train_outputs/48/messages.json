Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.\n\nHopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). \n\nDuring one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \\le x \\le 10^9$; $1 \\le y, k \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches.

You can trade one stick to get a certain number of sticks (x) or trade a certain number of sticks (y) to get one coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the required number of torches.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. For the coals, you need to trade `k * y` sticks to get `k` coals. Therefore, the total number of sticks needed is `k - 1 + k * y`. After trading for the required sticks, you can then trade for the coals. The number of trades can be calculated based on how many sticks you can get from each trade and how many trades you need to perform to reach the required number of sticks.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           x, y, k = test_case\n           total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n           trades_for_sticks = ceil(total_sticks_needed / (x - 1))\n           total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n           print(total_trades)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(t, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for i in range(t):\n        x, y, k = test_cases[i]\n        \n        # Calculate the total number of sticks needed\n        total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n        \n        # Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks\n        # Each trade gives (x - 1) additional sticks\n        trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)  # Using integer division to round up\n        \n        # Total trades is the trades for sticks plus the trades for k coals\n        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n        \n        # Store the result for this test case\n        results.append(total_trades)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Read input\nt = int(input())\ntest_cases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(t)]\n\n# Call the function with the input\nminimum_trades(t, test_cases)\n```"

The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after Chef uses buttons that can either reduce planned tasks (white buttons) or increase completed tasks (black buttons). The challenge involved ensuring that the usage of these buttons adhered to the constraints of not exceeding planned tasks and managing the state of the buttons effectively.\n\n    Throughout the attempts, the main issues identified were related to the logic for using the buttons. The initial approach incorrectly handled the conditions for applying black buttons, leading to incorrect calculations of completed tasks. The code also failed to optimally utilize the buttons across multiple days, which resulted in suboptimal outcomes.\n\n    Key strategies that were attempted included sorting the buttons in descending order and iterating through them to apply the largest available button first. However, the logic for removing buttons from the list and ensuring that the total completed tasks did not exceed the planned tasks was flawed.\n\n    The final realization was that a more careful management of the remaining tasks and button states was necessary. The code needed to ensure that after each day, the remaining planned tasks were accurately calculated and that buttons were used in a way that maximized their effectiveness across all days.\n\n    The following code snippet represents the last attempt, which still did not yield the correct results:\n\n    ```python\n    def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            B = case[4]\n            C = case[5]\n            D = case[6]\n        \n            # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order\n            C.sort(reverse=True)\n            D.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n            total_uncompleted = 0\n        \n            # Iterate through each day\n            for i in range(N):\n                remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks\n            \n                # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n                for white in C:\n                    if remaining_planned <= 0:\n                        break\n                    if white <= remaining_planned:\n                        remaining_planned -= white\n                        C.remove(white)  # Remove the used white button\n            \n                # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n                for black in D:\n                    if remaining_planned <= 0:\n                        break\n                    if B[i] + black <= A[i]:  # Ensure we don't exceed planned tasks\n                        B[i] += black  # Increase completed tasks\n                        D.remove(black)  # Remove the used black button\n            \n                # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted\n                total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)\n        \n            print(total_uncompleted)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing state and conditions in problems involving resource allocation and constraints. Future attempts should focus on a more systematic approach to button usage and task management.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
