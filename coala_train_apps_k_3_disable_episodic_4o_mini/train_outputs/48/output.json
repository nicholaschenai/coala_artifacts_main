    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   You start with one stick and want to craft a certain number of torches, each requiring one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the desired number of torches.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. To get `k` coals, you need to trade `k * y` sticks (since each coal requires `y` sticks). Therefore, the total number of sticks you need is `k - 1 + k * y`. After trading for sticks, you can trade for coal. The number of trades can be calculated based on how many sticks you can get from each trade and how many sticks you need to trade for coal.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function minimum_trades(x, y, k):\n       # Calculate the total number of sticks needed\n       total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n       \n       # Calculate how many trades are needed to get the required sticks\n       # Each trade gives (x - 1) additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick)\n       trades_for_sticks = ceil(total_sticks_needed / (x - 1))\n       \n       # Total trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coal\n       total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n       \n       return total_trades\n\n   function solve():\n       read number of test cases t\n       for each test case:\n           read x, y, k\n           result = minimum_trades(x, y, k)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef minimum_trades(x, y, k):\n    # Calculate the total number of sticks needed\n    total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y\n    \n    # Calculate how many trades are needed to get the required sticks\n    # Each trade gives (x - 1) additional sticks (since you lose 1 stick)\n    trades_for_sticks = (total_sticks_needed + (x - 2)) // (x - 1)  # Using ceiling division\n    \n    # Total trades is the sum of trades for sticks and trades for coal\n    total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k\n    \n    return total_trades\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    t = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        x, y, k = map(int, data[i].split())\n        result = minimum_trades(x, y, k)\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n```",
