## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   You start with one stick and want to craft a certain number of torches, where each torch requires one stick and one coal. You can trade one stick to get a certain number of sticks (x) or trade a certain number of sticks (y) to get one coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the required number of torches.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. For the coals, you need to trade `k * y` sticks to get `k` coals. Therefore, the total number of sticks needed is `k - 1 + k * y`. After trading for the required sticks, you can then trade for the coals. The number of trades can be calculated based on how many sticks you can get from each trade and how many trades you need to perform to reach the required number of sticks.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function minimum_trades(t, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           x, y, k = test_case
           total_sticks_needed = k - 1 + k * y
           trades_for_sticks = ceil(total_sticks_needed / (x - 1))
           total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k
           print(total_trades)
   ```

        # Calculate the number of trades needed to get the required sticks

        # Total trades is the trades for sticks plus the trades for k coals
        total_trades = trades_for_sticks + k

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal).

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_contests(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after Chef uses buttons that can either reduce planned tasks (white buttons) or increase completed tasks (black buttons). The challenge involved ensuring that the usage of these buttons adhered to the constraints of not exceeding planned tasks and managing the state of the buttons effectively.

    Throughout the attempts, the main issues identified were related to the logic for using the buttons. The initial approach incorrectly handled the conditions for applying black buttons, leading to incorrect calculations of completed tasks. The code also failed to optimally utilize the buttons across multiple days, which resulted in suboptimal outcomes.

    Key strategies that were attempted included sorting the buttons in descending order and iterating through them to apply the largest available button first. However, the logic for removing buttons from the list and ensuring that the total completed tasks did not exceed the planned tasks was flawed.

    The final realization was that a more careful management of the remaining tasks and button states was necessary. The code needed to ensure that after each day, the remaining planned tasks were accurately calculated and that buttons were used in a way that maximized their effectiveness across all days.

    The following code snippet represents the last attempt, which still did not yield the correct results:

    ```python
    def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            B = case[4]
            C = case[5]
            D = case[6]
        
            # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
            C.sort(reverse=True)
            D.sort(reverse=True)
        
            total_uncompleted = 0
        
            # Iterate through each day
            for i in range(N):
                remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks
            
                # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
                for white in C:
                    if remaining_planned <= 0:
                        break
                    if white <= remaining_planned:
                        remaining_planned -= white
                        C.remove(white)  # Remove the used white button
            
                # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
                for black in D:
                    if remaining_planned <= 0:
                        break
                    if B[i] + black <= A[i]:  # Ensure we don't exceed planned tasks
                        B[i] += black  # Increase completed tasks
                        D.remove(black)  # Remove the used black button
            
                # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted
                total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)
        
            print(total_uncompleted)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing state and conditions in problems involving resource allocation and constraints. Future attempts should focus on a more systematic approach to button usage and task management.

   You start with one stick and want to craft a certain number of torches, each requiring one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the desired number of torches.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. To get `k` coals, you need to trade `k * y` sticks (since each coal requires `y` sticks). Therefore, the total number of sticks you need is `k - 1 + k * y`.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   You start with one stick and want to craft a certain number of torches, each requiring one stick and one coal. You can trade sticks for more sticks or trade sticks for coal. The goal is to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft the desired number of torches.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To craft `k` torches, you need `k` sticks and `k` coals. Since you start with one stick, you need to acquire `k - 1` additional sticks. To get `k` coals, you need to trade `k * y` sticks (since each coal requires `y` sticks). Therefore, the total number of sticks you need is `k - 1 + k * y`. After trading for sticks, you can trade for coal. The number of trades can be calculated based on how many sticks you can get from each trade and how many sticks you need to trade for coal.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the minimum number of trades needed to craft a specified number of torches in a game scenario. Each torch requires one stick and one coal, and the player can trade sticks for more sticks or for coal. The key insight was to calculate the total number of sticks needed and how many trades would be required to obtain them.

The solution involved calculating the total sticks required as `k - 1 + k * y`, where `k` is the number of torches, and `y` is the number of sticks needed for one coal. The number of trades to acquire the necessary sticks was determined using ceiling division to account for the fact that each trade results in a net gain of `x - 1` sticks. The final number of trades included both the trades for sticks and the trades for coal.

The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided in the problem. The code was structured with a helper function to calculate the trades and a main function to handle input and output. The solution passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach was effective. 

Key takeaway: Understanding how to break down the problem into manageable parts (calculating total resources needed and trades required) is crucial for solving similar resource management problems efficiently.

## Official solution
for haaghfj in range(int(input())):
    x,y,k = list(map(int,input().split()))
    print(k + (y * k + k - 1 +x-2) // (x - 1))


INFO - [Task id] 48 [generation text] The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by directly calculating the total number of trades needed in a single line. The key insight is recognizing that the total number of trades can be derived from the number of torches needed (`k`), the number of sticks required for coal (`y`), and the number of sticks gained from trading (`x`). 

The formula used in the official solution is:
```python
k + (y * k + k - 1 + x - 2) // (x - 1)
```
This breaks down as follows:
1. `k` represents the trades needed to acquire the `k` coals (one trade for each coal).
2. The term `(y * k + k - 1 + x - 2) // (x - 1)` calculates the number of trades needed to gather enough sticks. It accounts for the total sticks required (`y * k` for coal and `k - 1` for the additional sticks needed) and divides by the effective gain of sticks per trade (`x - 1`).

The official solution is efficient and concise, leveraging integer division to avoid floating-point operations and ensuring that the calculations remain within integer bounds. 

In contrast, my initial approach involved breaking down the problem into multiple steps, which, while clear, was less efficient and more verbose. The official solution's direct calculation minimizes the number of operations and simplifies the logic, making it easier to understand and implement. 

Overall, the official solution is a great example of how to streamline problem-solving in competitive programming by reducing the number of steps and focusing on direct calculations.

[Problem]
    You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft $k$ torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.

    Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:  exchange $1$ stick for $x$ sticks (you lose $1$ stick and gain $x$ sticks).  exchange $y$ sticks for $1$ coal (you lose $y$ sticks and gain $1$ coal). 

    During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.

    Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.

    You have to answer $t$ independent test cases.


    -----Input-----

    The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$) â€” the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.

    The only line of the test case contains three integers $x$, $y$ and $k$ ($2 \le x \le 10^9$; $1 \le y, k \le 10^9$) â€” the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.


    -----Output-----

    For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least $k$ torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.


    -----Example-----
