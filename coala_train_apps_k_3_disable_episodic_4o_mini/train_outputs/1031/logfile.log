## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"
Chefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.
For each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.

-----Output-----
Output the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English

4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine if there exists a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we should return the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   A right-angled triangle has a hypotenuse \( H \) and two other sides \( a \) and \( b \). The area \( S \) of the triangle can be expressed as \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \). From the Pythagorean theorem, we know that \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \). We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and \( H \) and substitute it into the area formula to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find possible values for \( a \) and subsequently \( b \). If valid values are found, we will sort and return them; otherwise, we will return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_triangle(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           H, S = test_case
           if S * 2 > H * H:
               output -1
               continue
           a = sqrt((H * H) / 2 + sqrt((H * H) * (H * H) / 4 - S * S))
           b = (2 * S) / a
           if a > b:
               swap a and b
           if a^2 + b^2 == H^2:
               output a, b, H

        if S * 2 > H * H:
            results.append("-1")
            continue

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    ### Summary of Attempts for Permutation Problem

    The task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the function \( f(P) \) equals a given integer \( K \). The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a permutation of size \( N \) is \( N(N-1)/2 \).

    #### Key Insights:
    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \( f(P) \) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \( K \) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.
    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \( f(P) \)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \( K \) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.

    #### Issues Encountered:
    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \( K \). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.
    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.

    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:
    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.
    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.

    #### Final Code Snippet:
    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \( K \). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.

    ```python
    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
            if K > max_value:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                # Start with descending order
                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                current_sum = max_value
            
                # Adjust the permutation to reach K
                for i in range(N - 1):
                    if current_sum == K:
                        break
                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K
                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)
                    if max_reduce > 0:
                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce
                        current_sum -= max_reduce
            
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
        print("\n".join(map(str, results)))
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \( A[i] \) by its index \( i \) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:

    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is "YES". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is "NO". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \( N \) natural numbers.

    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \( N(N + 1)/2 \). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.

    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is zero.
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
       - Returning "NO" otherwise.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
        
            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, A))

    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning "YES" or "NO".

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), we can use the properties of right triangles. The area \( S \) can be expressed as \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two legs of the triangle. Additionally, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \). We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and substitute it into the area equation to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find valid values for \( a \) and \( b \).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

       a1 = sqrt((H^2 + sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
       a2 = sqrt((H^2 - sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
       
       # Calculate corresponding b values
       b1 = sqrt(H^2 - a1^2)
       b2 = sqrt(H^2 - a2^2)
       
       # Prepare the results

       sides2 = sorted([a2, b2, H])

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to determine if a right-angled triangle can be formed with a given hypotenuse length \( H \) and area \( S \). If such a triangle exists, we need to output the lengths of its sides in non-decreasing order. If it is not possible to form such a triangle, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To find the sides of a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), we can use the properties of right triangles. The area \( S \) can be expressed as \( S = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the two legs of the triangle. Additionally, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \). We can derive \( b \) in terms of \( a \) and substitute it into the area equation to find a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \). We can then solve this quadratic equation to find valid values for \( a \) and \( b \).

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine if a right-angled triangle could be formed with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). The solution involved using the properties of right triangles, specifically the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. 

The approach was to derive a quadratic equation based on the relationship between the sides and the area, and then solve for the lengths of the legs of the triangle. The discriminant of the quadratic equation was crucial in determining whether valid triangle sides could be found. If the discriminant was negative, it indicated that no valid triangle could be formed.

The final implementation successfully handled multiple test cases and formatted the output correctly. Key points included ensuring that the sides were sorted and that the output precision met the requirements. The solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.

Hereâ€™s the core function used to find the triangle:

```python
def find_triangle(H, S):
    area_double = 2 * S
    discriminant = H**4 - 4 * (area_double**2)
    
    if discriminant < 0:
        return -1
    
    a1 = ((H**2 + discriminant**0.5) / 2)**0.5
    a2 = ((H**2 - discriminant**0.5) / 2)**0.5
    b1 = (H**2 - a1**2)**0.5
    b2 = (H**2 - a2**2)**0.5
    
    sides1 = sorted([a1, b1, H])
    sides2 = sorted([a2, b2, H])
    
    if sides1[0] > 0 and sides1[1] > 0:
        return sides1
    if sides2[0] > 0 and sides2[1] > 0:
        return sides2
    
    return -1
```

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric properties and their mathematical implications in programming challenges.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1031 [generation text] The official solution provides a more concise and efficient approach to solving the problem of finding the sides of a right-angled triangle given the hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \). Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Discriminant Check**: The solution first checks if the expression \( (H^4 - 16S^2) \) is negative. If it is, it immediately outputs -1, indicating that a triangle cannot be formed. This is a crucial step to avoid unnecessary calculations when the conditions for forming a triangle are not met.

2. **Calculating the Base and Height**: The solution uses a mathematical approach to derive the lengths of the triangle's legs (base \( B \) and height \( P \)). It calculates \( B \) using the formula:
   \[
   B = \frac{\sqrt{H^2 + \sqrt{H^4 - 16S^2}}}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]
   This formula effectively derives one leg of the triangle based on the hypotenuse and area.

3. **Calculating the Other Leg**: The height \( P \) is calculated using the area:
   \[
   P = \frac{2S}{B}
   \]
   This ensures that the area condition is satisfied.

4. **Output Formatting**: The solution ensures that the output is formatted to six decimal places, which is important for precision in floating-point arithmetic.

5. **Sorting the Sides**: The solution checks which of the two legs \( B \) and \( P \) is larger and prints them in non-decreasing order along with the hypotenuse \( H \).

Overall, the official solution is efficient and leverages mathematical properties effectively, reducing the complexity of the problem. My initial approach was more verbose and involved solving a quadratic equation, which, while valid, was not as direct or efficient as the method used in the official solution. The official solution's use of direct calculations and checks for feasibility before proceeding with further calculations is a valuable lesson in optimizing problem-solving strategies.
