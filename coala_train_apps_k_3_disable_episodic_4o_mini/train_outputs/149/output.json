    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to take a string and repeatedly remove any group of `k` adjacent identical characters until no such groups remain. The goal is to return the final string after all possible removals.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can use a stack to help manage the characters and their counts. As we iterate through the string, we will push characters onto the stack. If we encounter a character that matches the top of the stack, we increment the count. If the count reaches `k`, we pop that character off the stack, effectively removing it from our result. If the character does not match, we reset the count. At the end of the iteration, we will construct the final string from the characters left in the stack.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty stack\n   Initialize an empty result string\n\n   For each character in the input string:\n       If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same as the current character:\n           Increment the count of the top character\n           If the count reaches k:\n               Pop the character from the stack (remove it)\n       Else:\n           Push the current character onto the stack with a count of 1\n\n   Construct the final string from the characters in the stack\n   Return the final string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n        stack = []\n        \n        # Iterate through each character in the string\n        for char in s:\n            # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character\n            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                # Increment the count of the top character\n                stack[-1][1] += 1\n                # If the count reaches k, pop the character from the stack\n                if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                    stack.pop()\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack with a count of 1\n                stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n        # Construct the final string from the characters in the stack\n        result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)\n        \n        return result\n```",
