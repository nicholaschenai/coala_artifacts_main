## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
Example 2:
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
Example 3:
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
2 <= k <= 10^4
s only contains lower case English letters.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to take a string `s` and repeatedly remove groups of `k` adjacent identical characters until no more such groups can be found. The goal is to return the final version of the string after all possible removals.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts. As we iterate through the string, we will push characters onto the stack. If we encounter the same character again, we will increment its count. If the count reaches `k`, we will pop that character from the stack, effectively removing it from our result. At the end of the iteration, we will reconstruct the string from the stack.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   For each character in the string:
       If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same character:
           Increment the count of that character
           If the count reaches k:
               Remove the character from the stack
       Else:
           Push the character onto the stack with a count of 1
   Construct the final string from the stack
   Return the final string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts
        stack = []
        
        # Iterate through each character in the string
        for char in s:
            # If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same character
            if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                # Increment the count of that character
                stack[-1][1] += 1
                # If the count reaches k, remove the character from the stack
                if stack[-1][1] == k:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                # Push the character onto the stack with a count of 1
                stack.append([char, 1])
        
        # Construct the final string from the stack
        result = ''.join(char * count for char, count in stack)
        return result

## Memories

[Summary]:
    The problem involved decoding a string formatted with patterns like `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string`. The solution required parsing the string while managing nested structures, which is a common pattern in problems involving brackets.

    The approach utilized a stack to keep track of the current string and the repeat count. As we iterated through the string, we built numbers for repeat counts, pushed the current state onto the stack when encountering `[`, and popped from the stack to construct the final string when encountering `]`. This method effectively handled nested encodings.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. Key concepts included managing state with a stack and handling string concatenation efficiently. The solution demonstrated the importance of careful parsing and state management in problems involving nested structures. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
            stack = []
            current_string = ""
            number = 0
        
            for char in s:
                if char.isdigit():
                    number = number * 10 + int(char)
                elif char == '[':
                    stack.append((current_string, number))
                    current_string = ""
                    number = 0
                elif char == ']':
                    last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()
                    current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count
                else:
                    current_string += char
        
            return current_string
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the utility of stacks in managing nested structures and the importance of careful iteration and state management in string manipulation tasks.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. 

    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach of generating all possible strings by removing and reinserting characters was effective, and the use of comparisons to track the smallest string worked as intended.

    The final implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each string, and outputting the results. The code was structured to first define the main function and then handle input/output, ensuring clarity and separation of logic. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. 

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    for i in range(N):  # Iterate through each character
        char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to move
        remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remove the character
        for j in range(N):  # Try to insert the character at every position
            new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]
            if new_string < smallest_string:  # Check if the new string is smaller
                smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of string manipulation techniques and careful iteration when solving combinatorial problems.

Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
Example 2:
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
Example 3:
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
2 <= k <= 10^4
s only contains lower case English letters.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        
```

INFO - [Task id] 149 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to take a string and repeatedly remove any group of `k` adjacent identical characters until no such groups remain. The goal is to return the final string after all possible removals.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We can use a stack to help manage the characters and their counts. As we iterate through the string, we will push characters onto the stack. If we encounter a character that matches the top of the stack, we increment the count. If the count reaches `k`, we pop that character off the stack, effectively removing it from our result. If the character does not match, we reset the count. At the end of the iteration, we will construct the final string from the characters left in the stack.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   Initialize an empty result string

   For each character in the input string:
       If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the same as the current character:
           Increment the count of the top character
           If the count reaches k:
               Pop the character from the stack (remove it)
       Else:
           Push the current character onto the stack with a count of 1

   Construct the final string from the characters in the stack
   Return the final string
   ```

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The problem involved removing adjacent duplicate characters from a string based on a specified count `k`. The solution utilized a stack to efficiently manage character counts and removals. The core concept was to iterate through the string, pushing characters onto the stack while tracking their counts. When a character's count reached `k`, it was removed from the stack.

The strategy of using a stack worked effectively, as it allowed for easy access to the last character and its count, facilitating quick updates and removals. The final string was constructed by joining the characters left in the stack, multiplied by their respective counts.

The implemented solution was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without issues. The key takeaway is the utility of stacks in problems involving consecutive elements and counts, which can simplify the logic and improve efficiency. 

Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        stack = []
        for char in s:

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        st=[['*',0]]
        for c in s:
            if c!=st[-1][0]:
                st.append([c,1])
            else:
                st[-1][1]+=1
                if st[-1][1]==k:
                    st.pop()
        res=''
        for c,v in st:
            res+=c*v
        return res

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a stack to manage character counts, similar to my approach. However, it simplifies the stack structure by using a list of lists, where each inner list contains a character and its count. This allows for more straightforward management of character counts and conditions for removal.

Key insights from the official solution:
1. **Stack Initialization**: The stack is initialized with a placeholder character and count (`['*', 0]`). This helps in handling the first character without additional checks.
2. **Character Comparison**: The solution checks if the current character is different from the last character in the stack. If it is, it appends a new entry; if not, it increments the count.
3. **Removal Logic**: The removal of characters occurs immediately when the count reaches `k`, which keeps the stack clean and avoids unnecessary iterations.
4. **Final String Construction**: The final result is constructed by iterating through the stack and multiplying each character by its count, which is efficient.

My approach was similar but could have been optimized by directly managing the stack entries without needing to check for empty conditions repeatedly. The official solution's method of using a placeholder character simplifies the logic and reduces the number of conditional checks, making it more elegant and potentially more efficient. 

Overall, the official solution is a good reference for using stacks in problems involving character counting and removal, highlighting the importance of simplifying conditions and leveraging data structures effectively.

INFO - [Task id] 149 [generation text] The function processes a string to remove consecutive duplicate characters that appear k times. It uses a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as it iterates through the string. When a character matches the one at the top of the stack, its count is incremented, and if the count reaches k, that character is removed from the stack. If the character does not match, it is added to the stack with an initial count of 1. Finally, the function constructs and returns a new string based on the characters remaining in the stack. This effectively reduces the string by removing specified consecutive duplicates.
