## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The MarkiT online virtual market startup wants to organize its grand opening in NIT Patna.
but they want maximum crowd for their inauguration. So the manager told  this  to Praveen a student in NITP who suggested them:
The first-year students come to campus  every x hour,
Second-year students come to campus every y hour,
Third-year students come to campus every z hour and 
Fourth-year is very busy so they don't come regularly.
So Praveen being very clever told him the no of times in n days he can have an audience of all year student (1st,2nd & 3rd) at max. So can you code what Praveen has done?

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a 2 line of input, first line contain one  integers $N$ (No of Days). 
-Next line contain 3 space separated integer the  value of x y z

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer the no of times audience consists of all year.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^8$
- $1 \leq x,y,z \leq 10^5$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
10
8 10 6

-----Sample Output:-----
2

-----EXPLANATION:-----
First favourable condition will come on 5th day and Second on 10th day.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to determine how many times all first, second, and third-year students will be present on campus together over a given number of days. Each group of students comes to campus at regular intervals defined by the integers x, y, and z, which represent the hours between their arrivals. We need to find out how many times all three groups will be present together within a specified number of days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals (x, y, z). The LCM will give us the time in hours when all three groups will be present together. Once we have the LCM, we can calculate how many times this LCM fits into the total hours available in N days (which is N * 24 hours). The result will be the number of times all three groups will be present together.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function gcd(a, b):
       while b is not 0:
           a, b = b, a % b
       return a

   function lcm(a, b):
       return (a * b) / gcd(a, b)

   function lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
       return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

   function count_audience(N, x, y, z):
       total_hours = N * 24
       lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
       return total_hours // lcm_value

   function main():
       read T
       for each testcase:
           read N
           read x, y, z
           result = count_audience(N, x, y, z)
           print(result)
   ```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    !!! example "[Timus - Crime and Punishment](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1430)"
        You're given integer numbers $A$, $B$ and $N$. Find $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$ such that $Ax + By \leq N$ and $Ax + By$ is the maximum possible.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        In this problem it holds that $1 \leq A, B, N \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$, so it can be solved in $O(\sqrt N)$. However, there is $O(\log N)$ solution with continued fractions.

        For our convenience, we will invert the direction of $x$ by doing a substitution $x \mapsto \lfloor \frac{N}{A}\rfloor - x$, so that now we need to find the point $(x; y)$ such that $0 \leq x \leq \lfloor \frac{N}{A} \rfloor$, $By - Ax \leq N \;\bmod\; A$ and $By - Ax$ is the maximum possible. Optimal $y$ for each $x$ has a value of $\lfloor \frac{Ax + (N \bmod A)}{B} \rfloor$.

        To treat it more generically, we will write a function that finds the best point on $0 \leq x \leq N$ and $y = \lfloor \frac{Ax+B}{C} \rfloor$.

        Core solution idea in this problem essentially repeats the previous problem, but instead of using lower semiconvergents to diverge from line, you use upper semiconvergents to get closer to the line without crossing it and without violating $x \leq N$. Unfortunately, unlike the previous problem, you need to make sure that you don't cross the $y=\frac{Ax+B}{C}$ line while getting closer to it, so you should keep it in mind when calculating semiconvergent's coefficient $t$.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            # (x, y) such that y = (A*x+B) // C,

        This problem reduces to the previous one if you note that $a \bmod b = a - \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor b$. With this fact, the sum reduces to

        $$\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left(p \cdot i - \left\lfloor \frac{p \cdot i}{q} \right\rfloor q\right) = \frac{pn(n+1)}{2}-q\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left\lfloor \frac{p \cdot i}{q}\right\rfloor.$$

        However, summing up $\lfloor rx \rfloor$ for $x$ from $1$ to $N$ is something that we're capable of from the previous problem.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**:
   The task is to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students will all be present on campus together over a given number of days. Each year has a specific frequency of attendance: first-year students come every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of days within `N` days when all three groups are present simultaneously.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**:
   To find out when all three groups are present together, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies `x`, `y`, and `z`. The LCM will give us the interval in hours at which all three groups will be present together. Once we have the LCM, we can calculate how many times this interval fits into the total number of hours in `N` days (which is `N * 24` hours). The result will be the number of times all three groups are present together.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function gcd(a, b):
       while b != 0:
           temp = b
           b = a % b
           a = temp
       return a

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective attendance frequencies. The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.

The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.

The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.

Key code snippets included:
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        temp = b
        b = a % b
        a = temp
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
    return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):
    total_hours = N * 24
    lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
    return total_hours // lcm_value
```

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The MarkiT online virtual market startup wants to organize its grand opening in NIT Patna.
but they want maximum crowd for their inauguration. So the manager told  this  to Praveen a student in NITP who suggested them:
The first-year students come to campus  every x hour,
Second-year students come to campus every y hour,
Third-year students come to campus every z hour and 
Fourth-year is very busy so they don't come regularly.
So Praveen being very clever told him the no of times in n days he can have an audience of all year student (1st,2nd & 3rd) at max. So can you code what Praveen has done?

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a 2 line of input, first line contain one  integers $N$ (No of Days). 
-Next line contain 3 space separated integer the  value of x y z

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output in a single line answer the no of times audience consists of all year.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^8$
- $1 \leq x,y,z \leq 10^5$

-----Sample Input:-----
1
10
8 10 6

-----Sample Output:-----
2

-----EXPLANATION:-----
First favourable condition will come on 5th day and Second on 10th day.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 694 [prompt] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**:
   The task is to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students will all be present on campus together over a given number of days. Each year has a specific frequency of attendance: first-year students come every `x` hours, second-year students every `y` hours, and third-year students every `z` hours. We need to find the number of days within `N` days when all three groups are present simultaneously.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**:
   To find out when all three groups are present together, we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies `x`, `y`, and `z`. The LCM will give us the interval in hours at which all three groups will be present together. Once we have the LCM, we can calculate how many times this interval fits into the total number of hours in `N` days (which is `N * 24` hours). The result will be the number of times all three groups are present together.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function gcd(a, b):
       while b != 0:
           temp = b
           b = a % b
           a = temp
       return a

   function lcm(a, b):
       return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

   function lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
       return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

   function count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):
       total_hours = N * 24
       lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
       return total_hours // lcm_value

   function solve():
       read T
       for each test case:
           read N
           read x, y, z
           result = count_audience_days(N, x, y, z)
           print(result)
   ```

        b = a % b
        a = temp

INFO - [Task id] 694 [generation text] The official solution effectively calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of three integers (the attendance frequencies of the students) and uses it to determine how many times all three groups will be present together over a specified number of days. 

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The official solution uses a helper function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a standard and efficient method for finding the GCD, which is crucial for calculating the LCM.

2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM is derived from the GCD using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]
   This is a concise and effective way to compute the LCM, and the official solution applies this method iteratively to find the LCM of three numbers.

3. **Total Hours Calculation**: The solution multiplies the number of days by 24 to convert days into hours, which is straightforward and necessary for the problem.

4. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It handles the input and output in a compact manner, making it suitable for the constraints provided.

Overall, the official solution is clear and concise, effectively breaking down the problem into manageable parts. My approach was similar in logic but could have been more streamlined in terms of function definitions and input handling. The official solution's use of a single function for GCD and LCM calculation is a good practice that enhances readability and maintainability.
