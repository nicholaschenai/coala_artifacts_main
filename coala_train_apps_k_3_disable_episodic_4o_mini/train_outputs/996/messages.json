Well, there is more to it, but for our\npurposes this is sufficient.\nThe game consists of several rounds and in each round both players\nobtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds\nhave been played, the total score of each player is determined by\nadding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher\ntotal score is declared the winner.\nThe Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where\nthe top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager\nof Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by\nchanging the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the\nend of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once\nall the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the\nend of any round in the game is declared the winner.\n\nConsider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:\nRoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890\n\nThe total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after\neach round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23\nNote that the above table contains the cumulative scores.\nThe winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58\nat the end of round 1) during the game.\nYour task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning\nlead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will\nalways be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.\nInput\nThe first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N\n\u2264 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines\n2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.\nLine i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1\nand 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 \u2264 Si \u2264\n1000 and 1 \u2264 Ti \u2264 1000.  \nOutput\nYour output must consist of a single line containing two integers\nW and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the\nmaximum lead attained by the winner.\nExample\nInput:\n5\n140 82\n89 134\n90 110\n112 106\n88 90\n\nOutput:\n1 58\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.\n\n    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.\n\n    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q\n            index += 1\n        \n            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills\n            index += 1\n        \n            # Create a prefix sum array\n            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)\n        \n            # Fill the prefix sum array\n            for i in range(1, N + 1):\n                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]\n        \n            # Process each query\n            for __ in range(Q):\n                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query\n                index += 1\n            \n                # Calculate the sum from X to Y\n                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]\n                results.append(result)  # Store the result\n    \n        # Print all results for all queries\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    # Call the solve function to execute the code\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.\n\n    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.\n\n    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def largest_prime_factor(n):\n        largest_prime = 1\n        while n % 2 == 0:\n            largest_prime = 2\n            n //= 2\n        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n            while n % i == 0:\n                largest_prime = i\n                n //= i\n        if n > 2:\n            largest_prime = n\n        return largest_prime\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        index = 1\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n            index += 1\n        \n            prime_count = {}\n        \n            for number in elements:\n                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)\n                if largest_prime in prime_count:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1\n                else:\n                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1\n        \n            max_count = -1\n            result_prime = -1\n        \n            for prime, count in prime_count.items():\n                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result_prime):\n                    max_count = count\n                    result_prime = prime\n        \n            results.append(result_prime)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It tracks the maximum lead achieved by either player and identifies the winner based on who had the highest lead at any point during the game. After processing all rounds, it outputs the winner and the maximum lead they held over the other player. The function utilizes a loop to iterate through the rounds and updates scores and leads accordingly. It ensures that the final result reflects the player with the greatest lead at any moment. The output is formatted to display both the winner and their maximum lead.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where games or competitions require a unique method of determining a winner based on cumulative scores rather than just total scores. It can be applied in sports analytics, game design, or any competitive setting where tracking leads over time is important. This approach can also be beneficial in educational contexts, such as teaching programming concepts related to loops, conditionals, and cumulative calculations."
