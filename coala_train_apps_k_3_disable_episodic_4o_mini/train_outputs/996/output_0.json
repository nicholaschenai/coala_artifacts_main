    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves determining the winner of a billiards game between two players based on their scores over several rounds. Instead of simply summing the scores, the winner is determined by the maximum lead that either player had at the end of any round. The input consists of the number of rounds and the scores for each player in those rounds. The output should indicate which player won and the maximum lead they achieved.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Read the number of rounds and the scores for each player in each round.\n   - Maintain cumulative scores for both players as we process each round.\n   - Calculate the lead for the current round and check if it is the maximum lead observed so far.\n   - Keep track of which player had the maximum lead and what that lead was.\n   - Finally, output the player number with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_winner():\n       read N (number of rounds)\n       initialize cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n       initialize cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n       initialize max_lead = 0\n       initialize winner = 0\n\n       for each round from 1 to N:\n           read scores S1 and S2\n           update cumulative_score_player1 += S1\n           update cumulative_score_player2 += S2\n           \n           if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n               lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2\n               if lead > max_lead:\n                   max_lead = lead\n                   winner = 1\n           else:\n               lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1\n               if lead > max_lead:\n                   max_lead = lead\n                   winner = 2\n\n       print winner and max_lead\n\n   main:\n       call find_winner()\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_winner():\n    # Read the number of rounds\n    N = int(input())\n    \n    # Initialize cumulative scores for both players\n    cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n    cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum lead and the winner\n    max_lead = 0\n    winner = 0\n\n    # Process each round\n    for _ in range(N):\n        # Read the scores for both players\n        S1, S2 = map(int, input().split())\n        \n        # Update cumulative scores\n        cumulative_score_player1 += S1\n        cumulative_score_player2 += S2\n        \n        # Determine the current lead and the leader\n        if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n            lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2\n            if lead > max_lead:\n                max_lead = lead\n                winner = 1\n        else:\n            lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1\n            if lead > max_lead:\n                max_lead = lead\n                winner = 2\n\n    # Output the winner and the maximum lead\n    print(winner, max_lead)\n\n# Call the function to execute the code\nfind_winner()\n```",
