## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90

Output:
1 58

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine the winner of a billiards game between two players based on their scores over several rounds. Instead of simply summing the scores, we will track the cumulative scores after each round and identify which player had the highest lead at any point during the game. The player with the maximum lead at the end of any round will be declared the winner, along with the value of that lead.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of rounds.
   - Initialize cumulative scores for both players to zero.
   - For each round, update the cumulative scores based on the scores provided.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round and determine which player is leading.
   - Keep track of the maximum lead and the corresponding player throughout all rounds.
   - Finally, output the player number with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read integer N (number of rounds)
   Initialize cumulative_score_player1 = 0
   Initialize cumulative_score_player2 = 0
   Initialize max_lead = 0
   Initialize winner = 0

   For each round from 1 to N:
       Read scores Si (Player 1) and Ti (Player 2)
       Update cumulative_score_player1 += Si
       Update cumulative_score_player2 += Ti
       
       If cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
           lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2
           If lead > max_lead:
               max_lead = lead
               winner = 1
       Else:
           lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1
           If lead > max_lead:
               max_lead = lead
               winner = 2

   Output winner and max_lead
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_winner():
    # Read the number of rounds
    N = int(input())

    winner = 0

    # Process each round

            lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_contests(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.

    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.

    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def largest_prime_factor(n):
        largest_prime = 1
        while n % 2 == 0:
            largest_prime = 2
            n //= 2
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            while n % i == 0:
                largest_prime = i
                n //= i
        if n > 2:
            largest_prime = n
        return largest_prime

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        index = 1
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))
            index += 1
        
            prime_count = {}
        
            for number in elements:
                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)
                if largest_prime in prime_count:
                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1
                else:
                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1
        
            max_count = -1
            result_prime = -1
        
            for prime, count in prime_count.items():
                if count > max_count or (count == max_count and prime > result_prime):
                    max_count = count

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves determining the winner of a billiards game between two players based on their scores over several rounds. Instead of simply summing the scores, the winner is determined by the maximum lead that either player had at the end of any round. The input consists of the number of rounds and the scores for each player in those rounds. The output should indicate which player won and the maximum lead they achieved.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Read the number of rounds and the scores for each player in each round.
   - Maintain cumulative scores for both players as we process each round.
   - Calculate the lead for the current round and check if it is the maximum lead observed so far.
   - Keep track of which player had the maximum lead and what that lead was.
   - Finally, output the player number with the maximum lead and the value of that lead.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_winner():
       read N (number of rounds)
       initialize cumulative_score_player1 = 0
       initialize cumulative_score_player2 = 0
       initialize max_lead = 0
       initialize winner = 0

       for each round from 1 to N:
           read scores S1 and S2
           update cumulative_score_player1 += S1
           update cumulative_score_player2 += S2

               lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
purposes this is sufficient.
The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
total score is declared the winner.
The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
at the end of round 1) during the game.
Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
Input
The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
Output
Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
maximum lead attained by the winner.
Example
Input:
5
140 82
89 134
90 110
112 106
88 90

Output:
1 58

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead achieved by either player at the end of any round, rather than simply summing their scores. The problem required careful tracking of cumulative scores and leads after each round.

The solution involved reading the number of rounds and the scores for each player, updating cumulative scores, and calculating the lead for each round. The maximum lead and the corresponding winner were tracked throughout the rounds. The implementation was straightforward, leveraging basic arithmetic and conditional statements to determine the leader and maximum lead.

The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and it passed the provided test case without any issues. Key concepts included cumulative score tracking, lead calculation, and conditional logic to determine the winner based on maximum lead. This experience reinforced the importance of maintaining state across iterations and the need for clear logic when comparing values. 

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
def find_winner():
    N = int(input())
    cumulative_score_player1 = 0
    cumulative_score_player2 = 0
    max_lead = 0
    winner = 0

    for _ in range(N):
        S1, S2 = map(int, input().split())
        cumulative_score_player1 += S1
        cumulative_score_player2 += S2
        
        if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
            lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2
            if lead > max_lead:
                max_lead = lead
                winner = 1
        else:
            lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1
            if lead > max_lead:
                max_lead = lead
                winner = 2

    print(winner, max_lead)

find_winner()
``` 

This solution effectively meets the problem's requirements and demonstrates a clear understanding of the necessary logic and data handling.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
s1=s2=lead=0
mlead1=mlead2=0
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, y= list(map(int, input().split()))
    s1, s2= s1+x, s2+y
    if(s1>s2):
        lead=(s1-s2)
        mlead1= max(mlead1, lead)
    else:
        lead=(s2-s1)
        mlead2= max(mlead2, lead)
if(mlead1<(mlead2)):
    print('2', mlead2)
else:
    print('1', mlead1)



INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] The official solution effectively simplifies the problem by maintaining separate cumulative scores for both players and tracking the maximum lead for each player in a straightforward manner. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Initialization**: The solution initializes cumulative scores (`s1` and `s2`) and maximum leads (`mlead1` and `mlead2`) for both players at the start. This is a clear and efficient way to keep track of the necessary values.

2. **Single Loop for Input Processing**: The solution processes the input in a single loop, reading scores for both players and updating their cumulative scores. This approach minimizes complexity and keeps the code concise.

3. **Lead Calculation**: After updating the scores, the solution checks which player is leading and updates the corresponding maximum lead. This is done using a simple conditional structure, which is both efficient and easy to understand.

4. **Final Decision**: At the end of the loop, the solution compares the maximum leads of both players and prints the winner along with their maximum lead. This final decision-making step is clear and direct.

Overall, the official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, as it only requires a constant amount of additional space and processes the input in linear time relative to the number of rounds. My initial approach was similar but could have been more concise by directly tracking maximum leads without needing to store the current lead separately. 

In future implementations, I will aim to streamline the logic further by focusing on maintaining only the necessary variables and minimizing the number of conditional checks.

The main function is `find_winner`.
INFO - [Task id] 996 [generation text] This function reads the number of rounds and processes the scores of two players, calculating their cumulative scores after each round. It tracks the maximum lead achieved by either player and identifies the winner based on who had the highest lead at any point during the game. After processing all rounds, it outputs the winner and the maximum lead they held over the other player. The function utilizes a loop to iterate through the rounds and updates scores and leads accordingly. It ensures that the final result reflects the player with the greatest lead at any moment. The output is formatted to display both the winner and their maximum lead.

[Problem]
    The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around
    on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our
    purposes this is sufficient.
    The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players
    obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds
    have been played, the total score of each player is determined by
    adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher
    total score is declared the winner.
    The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where
    the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager
    of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by
    changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the
    end of each round, the cumulative score for each player is calculated, and the leader and her current lead are found. Once
    all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the
    end of any round in the game is declared the winner.

    Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds:
    RoundPlayer 1Player 2114082289134390110411210658890

    The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after
    each round for this game is given below:RoundPlayer 1Player 2LeaderLead114082Player 1582229216Player 1133319326Player 274431432Player 215519522Player 23
    Note that the above table contains the cumulative scores.
    The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58
    at the end of round 1) during the game.
    Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning
    lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will
    always be a single winner.  That is, there are no ties.
    Input
    The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N
    â‰¤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game.  Lines
    2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.
    Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1
    and 2 respectively, in round i.  You may assume that 1 â‰¤ Si â‰¤
    1000 and 1 â‰¤ Ti â‰¤ 1000.  
    Output
    Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers
    W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the
    maximum lead attained by the winner.
    Example
    Input:
    5
    140 82
    89 134
    90 110
