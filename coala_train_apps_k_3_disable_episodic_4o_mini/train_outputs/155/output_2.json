    "raw_msg": "After reviewing the previous attempts and the insights gained, I will make the necessary adjustments to the code to ensure it correctly implements the jumping logic according to the problem's requirements. \n\n### Key Points to Address:\n1. **Jump Validity**: Ensure that when jumping to a new index, all intermediate values between the current index and the target index are less than the value at the starting index.\n2. **DFS Logic**: The DFS function should correctly count all reachable indices without prematurely terminating or missing valid paths.\n\nHere\u2019s the revised code that addresses these points:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:\n        # Helper function to perform DFS and count reachable indices\n        def dfs(index, visited):\n            if index in visited:\n                return 0  # If already visited, return 0\n            visited.add(index)  # Mark the current index as visited\n            max_count = 1  # Count the current index\n            \n            # Check jumps to the right\n            for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                if index + x < len(arr):  # Ensure within bounds\n                    if arr[index] > arr[index + x]:\n                        # Check if all values in between are less than arr[index]\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x, visited))\n            \n            # Check jumps to the left\n            for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                if index - x >= 0:  # Ensure within bounds\n                    if arr[index] > arr[index - x]:\n                        # Check if all values in between are less than arr[index]\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x, visited))\n            \n            return max_count\n\n        max_jumps = 0\n        for index in range(len(arr)):\n            visited = set()  # Reset visited for each starting index\n            max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index, visited))  # Update max jumps\n        return max_jumps\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function explores all possible jumps from the current index. It checks both left and right jumps within the distance `d`.\n- **Jump Validity**: For each potential jump, it checks if the destination index is valid (within bounds) and if the value at the starting index is greater than the value at the destination index. It also checks that all intermediate values are less than the starting index's value.\n- **Visited Set**: The `visited` set ensures that we do not revisit indices during the DFS, preventing infinite loops and redundant calculations.\n- **Max Jumps Calculation**: The outer loop iterates through each index in the array, resetting the `visited` set for each starting point and updating the maximum number of jumps found.\n\nThis code should now correctly handle the provided test cases and return the expected results.",
