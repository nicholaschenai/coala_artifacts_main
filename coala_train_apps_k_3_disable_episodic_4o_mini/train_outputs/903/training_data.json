    "summary": "In this task, the goal was to determine the position of a mirror on the x-axis so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The solution involved using a geometric reflection formula to calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror based on the coordinates of Kabir and Tara. The formula used was:\n\n\\[\nx_m = \\frac{x_1 \\cdot y_2 + x_2 \\cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}\n\\]\n\nThis formula effectively captures the relationship between the positions of Kabir and Tara, allowing for the correct placement of the mirror.\n\nThe implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each pair of coordinates, and outputting the calculated x-coordinate formatted to two decimal places. The solution was straightforward and did not encounter any unexpected errors. The code was structured to read input efficiently and output results in a single operation, which is beneficial for handling larger input sizes.\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships in programming problems and the utility of mathematical formulas in deriving solutions. The successful execution of the code demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach taken.",
    "reflection": "The official solution takes a different approach to solve the problem of finding the mirror's position. It uses the concept of linear equations to derive the x-coordinate of the mirror based on the coordinates of Kabir and Tara. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Reflection Concept**: The solution reflects Tara's y-coordinate across the x-axis by negating it. This is a straightforward way to visualize the problem geometrically.\n\n2. **Linear Equation**: The solution formulates the problem as a line equation. It calculates the slope (m) of the line connecting Kabir and Tara, and then uses the y-intercept (c) to find the x-coordinate of the mirror.\n\n3. **Simplified Calculation**: Instead of directly using the derived formula for the mirror's x-coordinate, the official solution calculates the slope and intercept, which can be more intuitive for understanding the relationship between the points.\n\n4. **Output Formatting**: The official solution ensures that the output is formatted to two decimal places, which is crucial for meeting the problem's requirements.\n\nOverall, while my initial approach was mathematically sound, the official solution's method of using linear equations provides a clear and effective way to derive the mirror's position. This experience highlights the importance of exploring different mathematical representations of a problem, as they can lead to more intuitive solutions.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThis function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of the coordinates of two points, Kabir and Tara. It calculates the x-coordinate of the mirror point using a reflection formula based on the provided coordinates. The results are formatted to two decimal places and stored in a list. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results, each on a new line. The function handles input and output efficiently, making it suitable for competitive programming scenarios. Overall, it provides a straightforward solution to the problem of finding the mirror point's x-coordinate.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to determine the position of a reflective surface (like a mirror) to allow indirect visibility between two points. This can apply in various fields such as architecture, interior design, and even in computer graphics where reflections and visibility calculations are important. Additionally, it can be relevant in physics problems involving optics and light reflection, as well as in practical situations like setting up cameras or projectors to capture or display images indirectly."
