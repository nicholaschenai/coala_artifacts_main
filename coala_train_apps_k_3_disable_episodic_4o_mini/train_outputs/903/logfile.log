INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine the position on the x-axis (the front wall of the classroom) where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir can see Tara's smile. Kabir and Tara are positioned at given coordinates in a 2D space, and we need to calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror based on their positions.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the position of the mirror, we can use the concept of reflection. The mirror's position on the x-axis should be such that the angle of incidence (the angle at which Kabir's line of sight hits the mirror) is equal to the angle of reflection (the angle at which the light reflects towards Tara). This can be calculated using the formula derived from the geometry of the situation. The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula:
   \[
   x_{mirror} = \frac{x1 + x2}{2} - \frac{(y1 - y2) \cdot (x1 - x2)}{2 \cdot (y1 + y2)}
   \]
   This formula takes into account the positions of Kabir and Tara and gives us the correct x-coordinate for the mirror.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_mirror_position(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read x1, y1
           read x2, y2

           store x_mirror in results
       return results

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof at the origin (0, 0) based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). 

    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.

    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum. The approach was straightforward and worked well within the constraints provided. 

    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently handling input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. The solution utilized a linear search for counting walls, which was acceptable given the constraints, but could be optimized further with binary search if necessary. Overall, the solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls
            index += 1
        
            walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions
            index += 1
        
            Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                x_j, y_j = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read query coordinates
                index += 1
            
                sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
                # Check if the point lies on any wall
                if sum_xy in walls:
                    results.append(-1)
                else:
                    # Count how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                    count = 0
                    for wall in walls:
                        if wall > sum_xy:
                            count += 1
                    results.append(count)

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.

    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many rooms in two houses could be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where each box contained a number of tiles equal to its index. The challenge involved ensuring that tiles from a single box were used to tile two rooms, one in each house, and that the total area of the rooms matched the number of tiles.

    The core concept revolved around checking pairs of rooms to see if their combined area equaled the number of tiles in an even-indexed box. The solution involved iterating through all boxes and checking all possible pairs of rooms, which could be computationally expensive given the constraints (up to \(10^{12}\) for N). 

    The initial approach was to use nested loops to check each box and room combination, but this would not scale well for large values of N. However, the provided solution worked correctly for smaller inputs, as evidenced by passing the sample test case.

    In future implementations, a more efficient algorithm would be necessary to handle larger values of N, possibly by leveraging mathematical properties of perfect squares or optimizing the search for room pairs. The final code snippet that worked for the sample input is as follows:

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(N):
        total_rooms = 0
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                for j1 in range(1, N + 1):
                    for j2 in range(1, N + 1):
                        if j1 != j2 and j1 * j1 + j2 * j2 == i:
                            total_rooms += 2
                            break
        return total_rooms

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ``` 

    This summary highlights the problem-solving approach, the challenges faced, and the need for optimization in future attempts.

   The task is to determine the position on the x-axis (the front wall of a classroom) where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir, sitting at a certain coordinate, can see Tara, who is sitting at another coordinate. The mirror's position is calculated based on the reflection of Tara's position across the x-axis.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to determine the position on the x-axis (the front wall of a classroom) where a mirror should be placed so that Kabir, sitting at a certain coordinate, can see Tara, who is sitting at another coordinate. The mirror's position is calculated based on the reflection of Tara's position across the x-axis.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the position of the mirror, we need to reflect Tara's y-coordinate across the x-axis. The y-coordinate of the mirror will be zero (since it's on the x-axis), and the x-coordinate of the mirror can be calculated using the formula derived from the geometry of reflection. The x-coordinate of the mirror can be found using the formula:
   \[
   x_m = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}
   \]
   This formula gives us the x-coordinate of the mirror based on the coordinates of Kabir and Tara.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function solve():
       read T  // number of test cases
       for each test case:
           read x1, y1  // Kabir's coordinates
           read x2, y2  // Tara's coordinates
           calculate x_m using the formula: (x1 * y2 + x2 * y1) / (y1 + y2)
           print x_m

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine the position of a mirror on the x-axis so that Kabir can see Tara's reflection. The solution involved using a geometric reflection formula to calculate the x-coordinate of the mirror based on the coordinates of Kabir and Tara. The formula used was:

\[
x_m = \frac{x_1 \cdot y_2 + x_2 \cdot y_1}{y_1 + y_2}
\]

This formula effectively captures the relationship between the positions of Kabir and Tara, allowing for the correct placement of the mirror.

The implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each pair of coordinates, and outputting the calculated x-coordinate formatted to two decimal places. The solution was straightforward and did not encounter any unexpected errors. The code was structured to read input efficiently and output results in a single operation, which is beneficial for handling larger input sizes.

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships in programming problems and the utility of mathematical formulas in deriving solutions. The successful execution of the code demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach taken.

INFO - [Task id] 903 [generation text] The official solution takes a different approach to solve the problem of finding the mirror's position. It uses the concept of linear equations to derive the x-coordinate of the mirror based on the coordinates of Kabir and Tara. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Reflection Concept**: The solution reflects Tara's y-coordinate across the x-axis by negating it. This is a straightforward way to visualize the problem geometrically.

2. **Linear Equation**: The solution formulates the problem as a line equation. It calculates the slope (m) of the line connecting Kabir and Tara, and then uses the y-intercept (c) to find the x-coordinate of the mirror.

3. **Simplified Calculation**: Instead of directly using the derived formula for the mirror's x-coordinate, the official solution calculates the slope and intercept, which can be more intuitive for understanding the relationship between the points.

4. **Output Formatting**: The official solution ensures that the output is formatted to two decimal places, which is crucial for meeting the problem's requirements.

Overall, while my initial approach was mathematically sound, the official solution's method of using linear equations provides a clear and effective way to derive the mirror's position. This experience highlights the importance of exploring different mathematical representations of a problem, as they can lead to more intuitive solutions.
