    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to reduce a given integer `n` to zero using the least number of operations. The operations allowed are: flipping the rightmost bit of `n` and flipping a specific bit `i` if the bit just before it is set to 1 and all bits before that are 0.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. We will keep track of the number of operations needed to reduce `n` to zero. For each operation, we will check the binary representation of `n` and decide which operation to perform based on the current bits. The goal is to minimize the number of operations by strategically choosing which bits to flip.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function minimumOneBitOperations(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 0\n       count = 0\n       while n > 0:\n           count += 1\n           find the rightmost 1 bit in n\n           flip the rightmost 1 bit\n           if there are more bits to flip, perform the second operation\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n        # Base case: if n is 0, no operations are needed\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Initialize the count of operations\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Loop until n becomes 0\n        while n > 0:\n            count += 1  # Increment the operation count\n            \n            # Find the rightmost 1 bit in n\n            rightmost_one = n & -n\n            \n            # Flip the rightmost 1 bit\n            n ^= rightmost_one\n            \n            # If there are more bits to flip, perform the second operation\n            if n > 0:\n                # Find the next significant bit to flip\n                next_bit = rightmost_one << 1\n                n ^= next_bit\n        \n        return count\n```",
