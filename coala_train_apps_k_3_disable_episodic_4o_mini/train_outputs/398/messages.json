A subarray is defined as a contiguous part of the array.\n\n2. **Cumulative Sum Logic**: The approach uses a cumulative sum to track the sum of elements as we iterate through the array. The idea is to check if the difference between the current cumulative sum and `k` has been seen before, which would indicate that there exists a subarray that sums to `k`.\n\n3. **HashMap Usage**: The hashmap is used to store the frequency of cumulative sums encountered so far. This allows us to quickly check how many times a particular cumulative sum has occurred.\n\n4. **Identifying the Error**: The error arises from the way we are counting subarrays. Specifically, we are incrementing the count when the cumulative sum equals `k`, which is correct. However, we also need to ensure that we are not double-counting subarrays that may overlap.\n\n   The issue is that when we check if `(cumulative_sum - k)` exists in the hashmap, we should only count it if it represents a valid subarray that ends at the current index. The current implementation may count some subarrays multiple times if they overlap.\n\n5. **Correcting the Logic**: We need to ensure that we are only counting valid subarrays that end at the current index. The logic for updating the hashmap and counting should be carefully structured to avoid double counting.\n\n### Revised Plan:\n- We will maintain the cumulative sum and check for the difference `(cumulative_sum - k)` in the hashmap.\n- We will update the hashmap after checking for the count to ensure we are only counting valid subarrays that end at the current index.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def subarraySum(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize a hashmap to store cumulative sums and their frequencies\n        cumulative_sum_count = {0: 1}  # To handle the case when cumulative sum equals k\n        cumulative_sum = 0  # This will hold the cumulative sum\n        count = 0  # This will count the number of valid subarrays\n\n        # Iterate through each number in the array\n        for num in nums:\n            cumulative_sum += num  # Update the cumulative sum\n            \n            # Check if (cumulative_sum - k) exists in the hashmap\n            if (cumulative_sum - k) in cumulative_sum_count:\n                count += cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum - k]\n            \n            # Update the hashmap with the current cumulative sum\n            if cumulative_sum in cumulative_sum_count:\n                cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum] += 1\n            else:\n                cumulative_sum_count[cumulative_sum] = 1\n            \n            # Check if the cumulative sum equals k\n            if cumulative_sum == k:\n                count += 1\n        \n        return count  # Return the count of valid subarrays\n``` \n\nThis revised code should correctly count the number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals `k` without double counting."

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.\n\n2. **Cumulative Sum Logic**: The approach uses a cumulative sum to track the sum of elements as we iterate through the array. The idea is to check if the difference between the current cumulative sum and `k` has been seen before in our hashmap.\n\n3. **HashMap Usage**: The hashmap is used to store the frequency of cumulative sums encountered so far. This allows us to quickly check how many times a particular cumulative sum has occurred.\n\n4. **Identifying the Error**: The error arises from the way we are counting subarrays. Specifically, we are incrementing the count when the cumulative sum equals `k`, which is correct. However, we also need to ensure that we are not double-counting subarrays that may overlap.\n\n   The issue is that when we check if `(cumulative_sum - k)` exists in the hashmap, we should only count it if it represents a valid subarray that ends at the current index. The current implementation may count some subarrays multiple times if they overlap.\n\n5. **Correcting the Logic**: We need to ensure that we are only counting valid subarrays that end at the current index. The logic for updating the hashmap and counting should be carefully structured to avoid double counting.\n\n### Revised Plan:\n- We will maintain the cumulative sum and check for the difference `(cumulative_sum - k)` in the hashmap.\n- We will update the hashmap after checking for the count to ensure we are only counting valid subarrays that end at the current index.\n\n### Key Insight:\nThe cumulative sum should be checked against `k` only after we have updated the hashmap with the current cumulative sum.

The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving subarrays and counts.\n\n    The core concept involved maintaining a count of odd numbers within a window defined by two pointers (left and right). As the right pointer expanded the window, the odd count was updated. If the count exceeded `k`, the left pointer was incremented to reduce the count back to `k`. When the count matched `k`, the number of valid subarrays was calculated by counting the even numbers to the left of the current window.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the sliding window technique is suitable for this type of problem. The key takeaway is the importance of managing two pointers to dynamically adjust the window size while keeping track of specific conditions (in this case, the count of odd numbers). \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n            result = 0\n            left = 0\n            odd_count = 0\n        \n            for right in range(len(nums)):\n                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:\n                    odd_count += 1\n            \n                while odd_count > k:\n                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:\n                        odd_count -= 1\n                    left += 1\n            \n                if odd_count == k:\n                    temp_left = left\n                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:\n                        temp_left += 1\n                    result += (temp_left - left + 1)\n        \n            return result\n    ``` \n\n    This approach effectively counts the desired subarrays while maintaining a linear time complexity, making it suitable for larger input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum at least \\( K \\). The solution involved using a sliding window technique combined with prefix sums to efficiently track the sums of subarrays.\n\n    The core concept was to maintain a running sum while iterating through the array. By calculating prefix sums, we could quickly determine the sum of any subarray. The strategy involved expanding the right pointer to include more elements and contracting the left pointer to minimize the length of valid subarrays when the sum condition was met.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the requirements and passed the provided test cases. The use of prefix sums allowed for efficient sum calculations, and the sliding window approach ensured that we explored all potential subarrays without unnecessary recalculations.
