    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to find the smallest substring in a given string `S` that contains all the characters from another string `T`. If no such substring exists, we should return an empty string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can use a sliding window approach to efficiently find the minimum window. We will maintain two pointers to represent the current window in `S`. We will expand the right pointer to include characters until we have all characters from `T`. Once we have a valid window, we will try to contract the left pointer to minimize the window size while still containing all characters from `T`. We will keep track of the minimum window found during this process.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function minWindow(S, T):\n       create a dictionary to count characters in T\n       create a dictionary to count characters in the current window\n       initialize left and right pointers\n       initialize min_length and min_window variables\n\n       while right pointer is less than length of S:\n           include S[right] in the current window\n           while current window contains all characters from T:\n               update min_length and min_window if current window is smaller\n               exclude S[left] from the current window\n               move left pointer to the right\n           move right pointer to the right\n\n       return min_window if found, else return \"\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n        # Step 1: Create a dictionary to count characters in T\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        \n        char_count_t = defaultdict(int)\n        for char in t:\n            char_count_t[char] += 1\n        \n        # Step 2: Create a dictionary to count characters in the current window\n        char_count_window = defaultdict(int)\n        \n        # Step 3: Initialize pointers and variables\n        left = 0\n        right = 0\n        min_length = float('inf')\n        min_window = \"\"\n        required = len(char_count_t)\n        formed = 0\n        \n        # Step 4: Expand the right pointer to include characters\n        while right < len(s):\n            char = s[right]\n            char_count_window[char] += 1\n            \n            # Step 5: Check if the current character is part of T and if we have enough of it\n            if char in char_count_t and char_count_window[char] == char_count_t[char]:\n                formed += 1\n            \n            # Step 6: Try to contract the window from the left\n            while left <= right and formed == required:\n                char = s[left]\n                \n                # Step 7: Update the minimum window if the current window is smaller\n                if right - left + 1 < min_length:\n                    min_length = right - left + 1\n                    min_window = s[left:right + 1]\n                \n                # Step 8: Remove the left character from the window\n                char_count_window[char] -= 1\n                if char in char_count_t and char_count_window[char] < char_count_t[char]:\n                    formed -= 1\n                \n                left += 1\n            \n            # Step 9: Move the right pointer to expand the window\n            right += 1\n        \n        # Step 10: Return the result\n        return min_window\n```",
