    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Gildong runs a bulgogi restaurant and wants to ensure that all customers are satisfied with the temperature when they arrive. Each customer has a specific time they arrive and a preferred temperature range. The restaurant's air conditioner can either heat, cool, or remain off, and the temperature can change by 1 degree per minute. The task is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet all customers' preferences at their respective arrival times.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we need to track the temperature range that can be achieved at each customer's arrival time. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does for all customers, we can satisfy them; otherwise, we cannot.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read n, m (number of customers, initial temperature)\n           current_time = 0\n           current_min_temp = m\n           current_max_temp = m\n           \n           for each customer in test_case:\n               read t_i, l_i, h_i (arrival time, lower bound, upper bound)\n               \n               # Calculate time passed since last customer\n               time_passed = t_i - current_time\n               \n               # Update the current temperature range\n               current_min_temp -= time_passed\n               current_max_temp += time_passed\n               \n               # Update the current time\n               current_time = t_i\n               \n               # Adjust the current temperature range to the customer's preferred range\n               current_min_temp = max(current_min_temp, l_i)\n               current_max_temp = min(current_max_temp, h_i)\n               \n               # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible to satisfy this customer\n               if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   break\n           else:\n               print(\"YES\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef can_satisfy_customers(test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, m = case[0], case[1]  # Number of customers and initial temperature\n        current_time = 0\n        current_min_temp = m\n        current_max_temp = m\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            t_i, l_i, h_i = case[2][i]  # Customer's visit time and preferred temperature range\n            \n            # Calculate time passed since last customer\n            time_passed = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update the current temperature range based on time passed\n            current_min_temp -= time_passed\n            current_max_temp += time_passed\n            \n            # Update the current time to the customer's visit time\n            current_time = t_i\n            \n            # Adjust the current temperature range to the customer's preferred range\n            current_min_temp = max(current_min_temp, l_i)\n            current_max_temp = min(current_max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible to satisfy this customer\n            if current_min_temp > current_max_temp:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n# Read input\nq = int(input())  # Number of test cases\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(q):\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())  # Number of customers and initial temperature\n    customers = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]  # Customer data\n    test_cases.append((n, m, customers))\n\n# Call the function with the test cases\ncan_satisfy_customers(test_cases)\n```",
