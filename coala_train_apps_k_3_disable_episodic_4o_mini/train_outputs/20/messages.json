The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.\n\nGildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.\n\nEach customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ \u2014 the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ \u2014 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ \u2014 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.\n\nA customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.\n\nGiven the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $-10^9 \\le m \\le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.\n\nNext, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9$, $-10^9 \\le l_i \\le h_i \\le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.\n\nThe customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n3 0\n5 1 2\n7 3 5\n10 -1 0\n2 12\n5 7 10\n10 16 20\n3 -100\n100 0 0\n100 -50 50\n200 100 100\n1 100\n99 -100 0\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. \n\nIn the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.\n\nIn the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each customer has a specific time they will arrive and a preferred temperature range. The restaurant has an air conditioner that can either heat, cool, or maintain the current temperature. The goal is to determine if it's possible to adjust the temperature to meet the preferences of all customers based on their arrival times.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   We need to track the temperature range that can be achieved by the time each customer arrives. Starting from the initial temperature, we will calculate how much time has passed since the last customer and adjust the temperature range accordingly. For each customer, we will check if the current achievable temperature range overlaps with their preferred range. If it does, we will update the achievable range for the next customer based on the time until their arrival. If at any point the ranges do not overlap, we will conclude that it is impossible to satisfy all customers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function canSatisfyCustomers(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read n, m\n           current_time = 0\n           min_temp = m\n           max_temp = m\n           \n           for each customer in test_case:\n               t_i, l_i, h_i = customer\n               time_passed = t_i - current_time\n               \n               # Update the temperature range based on time passed\n               min_temp -= time_passed\n               max_temp += time_passed\n               \n               # Update the achievable range to be within the customer's range\n               min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n               max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n               \n               # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible\n               if min_temp > max_temp:\n                   print(\"NO\")\n                   break\n               \n               current_time = t_i\n           else:\n               print(\"YES\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef canSatisfyCustomers(test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        # Read number of customers and initial temperature\n        n, m = test_case[0]\n        current_time = 0\n        min_temp = m\n        max_temp = m\n        \n        # Iterate through each customer\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            t_i, l_i, h_i = test_case[i]\n            time_passed = t_i - current_time\n            \n            # Update the temperature range based on time passed\n            min_temp -= time_passed\n            max_temp += time_passed\n            \n            # Update the achievable range to be within the customer's range\n            min_temp = max(min_temp, l_i)\n            max_temp = min(max_temp, h_i)\n            \n            # If the ranges do not overlap, it's impossible\n            if min_temp > max_temp:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n            \n            current_time = t_i\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# canSatisfyCustomers([\n#     [(3, 0), (5, 1, 2), (7, 3, 5), (10, -1, 0)],\n#     [(2, 12), (5, 7, 10), (10, 16, 20)],\n#     [(3, -100), (100, 0, 0), (100, -50, 50), (200, 100, 100)],\n#     [(1, 100), (99, -100, 0)]\n# ])\n```"

The key concepts involved were understanding the total demand from the minions and ensuring that each individual demand could be satisfied without exceeding the amount of money Gru had at any point.\n\n    Initially, the approach was to simply check if the total demand equaled the amount of money Gru had. However, this was insufficient because it did not account for the individual demands of the minions. The correct approach required checking both the total demand and ensuring that each individual demand was less than or equal to the money Gru had.\n\n    The final solution involved calculating the total demand and checking if it matched Gru's total money. If it did, the output was \"YES\"; otherwise, it was \"NO\". However, the solution failed to pass the tests because it did not consider the scenario where the total demand could be less than Gru's money but still not allow for exact distribution.\n\n    The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of considering both aggregate and individual constraints when solving distribution problems. The final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Extract number of minions and amount of money Gru has\n            A = case[2]  # Extract the list of demands from minions\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)  # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by minions\n        \n            # Check if the total demand equals the money Gru has\n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")  # Gru can distribute the money exactly\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")  # Gru cannot distribute the money as required\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the need for careful consideration of problem constraints and the importance of validating both total and individual conditions in distribution scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.\n\n    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            if K == N:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by reading the number of test cases and initializing the current temperature range (`now`) to the initial temperature `m` for both the minimum and maximum.\n\n2. **Iterating through Customers**: For each customer, the solution calculates the time elapsed since the last customer and adjusts the current temperature range accordingly. This is done by subtracting the elapsed time from the minimum temperature and adding it to the maximum temperature.\n\n3. **Checking Overlap**: The solution checks if the adjusted temperature range overlaps with the customer's preferred range. If there is no overlap, it sets a flag to `False`, indicating that not all customers can be satisfied.\n\n4. **Updating the Range**: If there is an overlap, the solution updates the current temperature range to reflect the intersection of the current achievable range and the customer's preferred range.\n\n5. **Output**: After processing all customers, the solution prints \"YES\" if all customers can be satisfied and \"NO\" otherwise.\n\nThe official solution is efficient because it processes each customer in constant time, leading to a time complexity of O(n) per test case. This is optimal given the constraints. My initial approach was similar but could have been more concise in managing the temperature ranges and checking overlaps. The official solution's use of a flag to track satisfaction status is a clean way to handle the output logic. \n\nOverall, the official solution emphasizes the importance of maintaining a dynamic state and efficiently checking conditions, which is a valuable lesson for similar problems in the future."

        "content": "\n[description for function: can_satisfy_customers]\nThe function processes multiple test cases to determine if a series of customers can be satisfied with a temperature range that adjusts over time. For each customer, it calculates the time elapsed since the last visit and updates the current temperature range accordingly. It then checks if the updated range can accommodate the customer's preferred temperature limits. If at any point the ranges do not overlap, it concludes that it is impossible to satisfy that customer and outputs \"NO\". If all customers can be satisfied within their preferred ranges, it outputs \"YES\". The function handles input reading and processes each test case in sequence.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where a business needs to manage customer satisfaction based on specific conditions, such as temperature control in a restaurant. It can be applied to any situation where multiple clients have varying preferences that need to be accommodated within a limited timeframe. This could extend to other service industries, such as hotels, event planning, or any environment where conditions must be adjusted to meet customer expectations. Understanding how to manage constraints and optimize conditions for multiple stakeholders is a valuable skill in operations management."
