    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The problem involves a game played between two players, you and the Grinch, where you take turns making moves with a number \\( N \\). The moves allowed are either dividing \\( N \\) by any of its odd divisors greater than 1 or subtracting 1 from \\( N \\) if \\( N \\) is greater than 1. The player who cannot make a move loses. You always go first, and the task is to determine the winner for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine the winner, we can analyze the game using a strategy based on the properties of the number \\( N \\). If \\( N \\) is 1, the Grinch wins because you cannot make a move. For other values of \\( N \\), we can use a recursive approach to simulate the game. We can keep track of whether the current player can force a win based on the possible moves. If there exists a move that leads to a position where the opponent cannot win, then the current player can win.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function canWin(N):\n       if N == 1:\n           return False  // Grinch wins\n       for each odd divisor d of N greater than 1:\n           if not canWin(N / d):\n               return True  // Current player can win\n       if N > 1:\n           if not canWin(N - 1):\n               return True  // Current player can win\n       return False  // Current player cannot win\n\n   function solve():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           if canWin(N):\n               print \"Me\"\n           else:\n               print \"Grinch\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef canWin(N):\n    # Base case: if N is 1, the current player loses\n    if N == 1:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check all odd divisors greater than 1\n    for d in range(3, N + 1, 2):\n        if N % d == 0:  # d is an odd divisor of N\n            if not canWin(N // d):  # If the opponent cannot win from this position\n                return True  # Current player can win\n    \n    # Check the option to subtract 1\n    if N > 1 and not canWin(N - 1):  # If the opponent cannot win after subtracting 1\n        return True  # Current player can win\n    \n    return False  # Current player cannot win\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n        if canWin(N):\n            results.append(\"Me\")  # You win\n        else:\n            results.append(\"Grinch\")  # Grinch wins\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)  # Output results for all test cases\n\nsolve()\n```",
