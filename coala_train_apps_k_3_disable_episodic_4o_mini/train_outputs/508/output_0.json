    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We have a street represented as a number line with several roadworks that block certain points for specific time intervals. People start walking from the origin (0) at different times and will stop when they reach a blocked point. Our task is to determine how far each person can walk before they encounter a blockage or if they can walk indefinitely.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - We need to keep track of the roadworks and their blocking intervals.\n   - For each person, we will check if they encounter a blockage based on their start time and the time it takes them to reach each blocked point.\n   - If a person starts walking after a blockage has ended, they can walk indefinitely.\n   - We will store the results for each person and print them at the end.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Read N and Q\n   Initialize a list to store roadworks\n   For i from 1 to N:\n       Read S_i, T_i, X_i and store them in the roadworks list\n\n   Sort the roadworks based on X_i\n\n   For j from 1 to Q:\n       Read D_j\n       Initialize distance as -1\n       For each roadwork (S_i, T_i, X_i):\n           If D_j < S_i:\n               If distance is -1 or X_i < distance:\n                   distance = X_i\n           Else if S_i <= D_j < T_i:\n               If distance is -1 or X_i < distance:\n                   distance = X_i\n       If distance is still -1:\n           Print -1\n       Else:\n           Print distance\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    # Read the number of roadworks (N) and the number of people (Q)\n    N, Q = map(int, data[0].split())\n    \n    roadworks = []\n    \n    # Read each roadwork's start time, end time, and position\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        S, T, X = map(int, data[i].split())\n        roadworks.append((S, T, X))\n    \n    # Sort roadworks by position X\n    roadworks.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    # Read each person's start time\n    for j in range(N + 1, N + 1 + Q):\n        D = int(data[j])\n        distance = -1\n        \n        # Check each roadwork to see if the person will be blocked\n        for S, T, X in roadworks:\n            if D < S:\n                # If the person starts before the roadwork starts\n                if distance == -1 or X < distance:\n                    distance = X\n            elif S <= D < T:\n                # If the person starts during the roadwork\n                if distance == -1 or X < distance:\n                    distance = X\n        \n        # If distance is still -1, the person walks forever\n        results.append(distance if distance != -1 else -1)\n    \n    # Print all results for each person\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the code\nsolve()\n```",
