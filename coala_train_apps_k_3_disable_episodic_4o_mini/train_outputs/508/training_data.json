    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to determine how far each person can walk along a number line before encountering roadworks that block certain points for specific time intervals. The main challenge was correctly identifying when a person is blocked based on their start time and the blocking intervals of the roadworks.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n1. **Blocking Intervals**: Each roadwork has a start time, end time, and a position on the number line. A person walking towards a blocked point must stop if they reach it during the blocking time.\n2. **Time Management**: The solution required careful handling of the start times of both the roadworks and the people to determine if a person would be blocked or could walk indefinitely.\n\n### Strategies and Errors:\n- The initial approach incorrectly handled the logic for determining when a person is blocked. It failed to account for cases where a person starts walking during a roadwork's blocking time.\n- The distance variable was not updated correctly when multiple roadworks were present, leading to incorrect results.\n- The solution needed to ensure that if a person starts walking after all roadworks have ended, they should be able to walk indefinitely.\n\n### Final Code Snippet:\nThe final implementation correctly checks each person's start time against the roadworks and updates the distance accordingly:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    N, Q = map(int, data[0].split())\n    roadworks = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        S, T, X = map(int, data[i].split())\n        roadworks.append((S, T, X))\n    \n    roadworks.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for j in range(N + 1, N + 1 + Q):\n        D = int(data[j])\n        distance = -1\n        \n        for S, T, X in roadworks:\n            if D < S:\n                if distance == -1 or X < distance:\n                    distance = X\n            elif S <= D < T:\n                distance = X\n                break\n        \n        results.append(distance if distance != -1 else -1)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the code\nsolve()\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the logic for blocking intervals is correctly applied, allowing for accurate results based on the input conditions.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach using event processing and a priority queue (min-heap) to handle the roadworks and queries. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Event Representation**:\n   - Each roadwork is represented by two events: \n     - A start event when the roadwork begins (`S - X - 0.5` with type `1`).\n     - An end event when the roadwork ends (`T - X - 0.5` with type `0`).\n   - Each person's query is also treated as an event, with the time they start walking (`D`) and type `2`.\n\n2. **Sorting Events**:\n   - All events (roadworks and queries) are sorted by time. This allows for a linear pass through the events in chronological order.\n\n3. **Using a Priority Queue**:\n   - A priority queue (min-heap) is used to keep track of currently active roadworks. When a person starts walking (query event), the algorithm checks the heap for the nearest active roadwork.\n   - If a roadwork ends, it is marked as closed, and the heap is updated accordingly.\n\n4. **Efficient Query Handling**:\n   - For each query, the algorithm pops from the heap until it finds an active roadwork. This ensures that the person stops at the nearest blocked point.\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - The results for each query are stored in a list and printed at the end, ensuring efficient output handling.\n\n### Reasoning for the Official Solution's Effectiveness:\n- The official solution is more efficient than the previous attempts because it processes all events in a single pass after sorting, rather than checking each roadwork for every person individually. This reduces the time complexity significantly, especially with larger inputs.\n- The use of a priority queue allows for quick access to the nearest active roadwork, making the solution scalable and efficient.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe official solution's approach of using event processing and a priority queue is a powerful technique for handling problems involving intervals and queries. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can optimize performance, especially in scenarios with potentially large input sizes.",
