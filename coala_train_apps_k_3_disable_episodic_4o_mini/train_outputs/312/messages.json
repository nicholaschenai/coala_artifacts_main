The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving subarrays and counts.\n\n    The core concept involved maintaining a count of odd numbers within a window defined by two pointers (left and right). As the right pointer expanded the window, the odd count was updated. If the count exceeded `k`, the left pointer was incremented to reduce the count back to `k`. When the count matched `k`, the number of valid subarrays was calculated by counting the even numbers to the left of the current window.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the sliding window technique is suitable for this type of problem. The key takeaway is the importance of managing two pointers to dynamically adjust the window size while keeping track of specific conditions (in this case, the count of odd numbers). \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n            result = 0\n            left = 0\n            odd_count = 0\n        \n            for right in range(len(nums)):\n                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:\n                    odd_count += 1\n            \n                while odd_count > k:\n                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:\n                        odd_count -= 1\n                    left += 1\n            \n                if odd_count == k:\n                    temp_left = left\n                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:\n                        temp_left += 1\n                    result += (temp_left - left + 1)\n        \n            return result\n    ``` \n\n    This approach effectively counts the desired subarrays while maintaining a linear time complexity, making it suitable for larger input sizes.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted array of integers. The solution utilized a dynamic programming approach, which is a common strategy for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index, updating it based on previous elements.\n\n    The implemented algorithm iterated through the input array, comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length of the subsequence was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by taking the maximum value from the array that tracked the lengths.\n\n    The code snippet for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            d = [1] * len(nums)\n        \n            for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This approach runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem constraints. The solution was successful, passing all tests, indicating that the dynamic programming strategy was effective in this case. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of finding the contiguous segment of railway stations with the sum closest to zero, I initially struggled with correctly tracking prefix sums and updating the best segment based on the closest sum to zero. The key concepts involved were prefix sums and maintaining a mapping of these sums to their first occurrences.\n\n    The first attempts failed primarily due to incorrect logic in updating the best segment indices and not properly handling cases where the prefix sum itself was zero. I also overlooked the need to ensure that the output was in 1-based indexing.\n\n    The final solution involved calculating prefix sums and using a dictionary to track the first occurrence of each prefix sum. For each prefix sum, I checked against previously stored sums to find the closest to zero, updating the best segment accordingly. This approach effectively handled the requirements of the problem and passed all tests.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_closest_segment(profits):\n        N = len(profits)\n        prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)\n        best_sum = float('inf')\n        best_start = 0\n        best_end = 0\n        sum_index_map = {0: 0}  # Initialize with prefix sum 0 at index 0\n\n        # Calculate prefix sums\n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + profits[i - 1]\n\n        # Check for closest sum to zero\n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            current_sum = prefix_sum[i]\n        \n            # Check for the closest prefix sum to current_sum\n            for key in list(sum_index_map.keys()):\n                if abs(current_sum - key) < abs(best_sum) or (abs(current_sum - key) == abs(best_sum) and (i - sum_index_map[key]) > (best_end - best_start)):\n                    best_sum = current_sum - key\n                    best_start = sum_index_map[key] + 1\n                    best_end = i\n\n            # Store the first occurrence of the prefix sum\n            if current_sum not in sum_index_map:\n                sum_index_map[current_sum] = i\n\n        # Adjust for 1-based indexing\n        return best_sum, best_start, best_end\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful index management and the utility of prefix sums in solving range sum problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
