    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to find the length of the longest subsequence in a given list of integers where the elements of the subsequence are in strictly increasing order. The input is an unsorted array of integers, and we only need to return the length of this longest increasing subsequence (LIS).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will maintain an array where each element at index `i` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We will iterate through the array and for each element, check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. The final answer will be the maximum value in this array.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function lengthOfLIS(nums):\n       if nums is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       create an array d of the same length as nums, initialized to 1\n       for i from 1 to length of nums - 1:\n           for j from 0 to i - 1:\n               if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                   d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n       \n       return max value in d\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Check if the input list is empty\n        if not nums:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Create an array d to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n        d = [1] * len(nums)\n        \n        # Iterate through the array to fill the d array\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            for j in range(i):\n                # If the current number is greater than the previous number\n                if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                    # Update the d array with the maximum length found\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n        # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in d\n        return max(d)\n```",
