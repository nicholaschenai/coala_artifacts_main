i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0;

The array $d$ will always be sorted: \n        $d[l-1] < d[l]$ for all $i = 1 \\dots n$.\n\n        This is trivial, as you can just remove the last element from the increasing subsequence of length $l$, and you get a increasing subsequence of length $l-1$ with a smalller ending number.\n\n    2.  The element $a[i]$ will only update at most one value $d[l]$.\n\n        This follows immediately from the above implementation.\n        There can only be one place in the array with $d[l-1] < a[i] < d[l]$.\n\n    Thus we can find this element in the array $d[]$ using [binary search](../num_methods/binary_search.md) in $O(\\log n)$.\n    In fact we can simply look in the array $d[]$ for the first number that is strictly greater than $a[i]$, and we try to update this element in the same way as the above implementation.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    This gives us the improved $O(n \\log n)$ implementation:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_method2_nlogn}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        const int INF = 1e9;\n        vector<int> d(n+1, INF);\n        d[0] = -INF;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int l = upper_bound(d.begin(), d.end(), a[i]) -

1] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. \n    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).\n\n    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:\n    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.\n    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).\n    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.\n\n    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:\n    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.\n    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).\n\n    ## Related tasks\n\n    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence\n\n    This is in fact nearly the same problem.\n    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.\n\n    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.\n    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.\n\n    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences\n\n    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.\n    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.\n\n    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.\n    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.\n\n    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.\n\n    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence\n\n    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \\dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.\n\n    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    **Proof**:\n    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.\n\n    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.\n    We need to prove that $x = y$.\n\n    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.\n    Therefore we have $y \\ge x$.\n\n    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.\n    Suppose that $y > x$.\n    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.\n    We transform this in set in the following way:\n    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.\n    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.\n    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.\n\n    Thus it follows that $y = x$.\n\n    **Restoring the sequences**:\n    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.\n    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The input is an unsorted array of integers, and we only need to return the length of this longest increasing subsequence (LIS).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will maintain an array where each element at index `i` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We will iterate through the array and for each element, check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. The final answer will be the maximum value in this array.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function lengthOfLIS(nums):\n       if nums is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       create an array d of the same length as nums, initialized to 1\n       for i from 1 to length of nums - 1:\n           for j from 0 to i - 1:\n               if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                   d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n       \n       return max value in d\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Check if the input list is empty\n        if not nums:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Create an array d to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n        d = [1] * len(nums)\n        \n        # Iterate through the array to fill the d array\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            for j in range(i):\n                # If the current number is greater than the previous number\n                if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                    # Update the d array with the maximum length found\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n        # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in d\n        return max(d)\n```"

        "content": "The problem involved finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted array of integers. The solution utilized a dynamic programming approach, which is a common strategy for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index, updating it based on previous elements.\n\nThe implemented algorithm iterated through the input array, comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length of the subsequence was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by taking the maximum value from the array that tracked the lengths.\n\nThe code snippet for the solution is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        if not nums:\n            return 0\n        \n        d = [1] * len(nums)\n        \n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            for j in range(i):\n                if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n        return max(d)\n```\n\nThis approach runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem constraints. The solution was successful, passing all tests, indicating that the dynamic programming strategy was effective in this case. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation."

This is a significant improvement over the O(n^2) complexity of my initial solution.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, it returns 0. It initializes a list `res` to keep track of the smallest tail values of increasing subsequences found so far.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: A helper function `binarySearch` is defined to find the position in the `res` list where the current number should be placed. This function uses a binary search algorithm to efficiently find the correct index, ensuring that the `res` list remains sorted.\n\n3. **Iterating through the input**: The solution iterates through the input list starting from the second element. If the current number is greater than the last element in `res`, it appends the number to `res`. Otherwise, it uses the `binarySearch` function to find the appropriate index to replace an existing value in `res`, maintaining the property of the smallest tail values.\n\n4. **Final Result**: The length of the `res` list at the end of the iteration represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\nThe official solution is more efficient because it reduces the number of comparisons needed to maintain the increasing subsequence, leveraging the sorted nature of the `res` list and the logarithmic time complexity of binary search. This approach is particularly useful for larger datasets where performance is critical. \n\nIn contrast, my initial solution, while correct, was less efficient due to the nested loops that resulted in a quadratic time complexity. This experience highlights the importance of considering different algorithmic strategies, especially when dealing with problems that can be optimized through data structures like lists and search algorithms."
