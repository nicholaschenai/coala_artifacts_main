## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        
```

## Problem

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays containing exactly `k` odd numbers from a given list of integers. The solution utilized a sliding window approach, which is effective for problems involving subarrays and counts.

    The core concept involved maintaining a count of odd numbers within a window defined by two pointers (left and right). As the right pointer expanded the window, the odd count was updated. If the count exceeded `k`, the left pointer was incremented to reduce the count back to `k`. When the count matched `k`, the number of valid subarrays was calculated by counting the even numbers to the left of the current window.

    The implemented solution was efficient and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the sliding window technique is suitable for this type of problem. The key takeaway is the importance of managing two pointers to dynamically adjust the window size while keeping track of specific conditions (in this case, the count of odd numbers). 

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
            result = 0
            left = 0
            odd_count = 0
        
            for right in range(len(nums)):
                if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                    odd_count += 1
            
                while odd_count > k:
                    if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                        odd_count -= 1
                    left += 1
            
                if odd_count == k:
                    temp_left = left
                    while temp_left < right and nums[temp_left] % 2 == 0:
                        temp_left += 1
                    result += (temp_left - left + 1)
        
            return result
    ``` 

    This approach effectively counts the desired subarrays while maintaining a linear time complexity, making it suitable for larger input sizes.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the length of the shortest contiguous subarray with a sum at least \( K \). The solution involved using a sliding window technique combined with prefix sums to efficiently track the sums of subarrays.

    The core concept was to maintain a running sum while iterating through the array. By calculating prefix sums, we could quickly determine the sum of any subarray. The strategy involved expanding the right pointer to include more elements and contracting the left pointer to minimize the length of valid subarrays when the sum condition was met.

    The final implementation successfully handled the requirements and passed the provided test cases. The use of prefix sums allowed for efficient sum calculations, and the sliding window approach ensured that we explored all potential subarrays without unnecessary recalculations. This method proved effective for the problem constraints, demonstrating a clear pattern for solving similar problems involving subarray sums. 

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def shortestSubarray(self, A: list[int], K: int) -> int:
            n = len(A)
            min_length = float('inf')  # Initialize minimum length as infinity
            current_sum = 0  # Initialize current sum
            left = 0  # Initialize left pointer
            prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)  # Create a prefix sum array

            # Calculate prefix sums
            for i in range(n):
                prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + A[i]

            # Iterate through the prefix sums
            for right in range(1, n + 1):
                current_sum = prefix_sums[right]  # Current sum is the prefix sum at right
            
                # Check if we can find a valid subarray
                while left < right and current_sum - prefix_sums[left] >= K:
                    min_length = min(min_length, right - left)  # Update minimum length
                    left += 1  # Move left pointer to the right

            # Return the result
            return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding prefix sums and sliding window techniques for efficiently solving subarray problems.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Hereâs the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find the sum of specific elements from a sorted list of all possible sums of continuous subarrays derived from a given list of positive integers. The indices of the elements to sum are provided, and the result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - First, we need to generate all possible continuous subarrays from the input list and calculate their sums.
   - Once we have all the sums, we will sort them in non-decreasing order.
   - After sorting, we will extract the sums from the specified indices (given as `left` and `right`).
   - Finally, we will compute the total of these sums and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function rangeSum(nums, n, left, right):
       Initialize an empty list to store subarray sums
       for start from 0 to n-1:
           Initialize current_sum to 0

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50

Â 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
nums.length == n
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] The problem involved calculating the sum of specific elements from a sorted list of all possible sums of continuous subarrays derived from a given list of positive integers. The key steps included generating all subarray sums, sorting them, and then summing the elements between specified indices.

The solution effectively utilized nested loops to compute the subarray sums, which were then sorted. The final sum was calculated by iterating over the specified range of indices. The implementation was straightforward and adhered to the constraints provided, ensuring that the result was returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

One important takeaway is the efficiency of generating subarray sums using a cumulative approach, where the current sum is updated as we extend the subarray. This method avoids recalculating sums from scratch, making it more efficient. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. 

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def rangeSum(self, nums: list[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        subarray_sums = []
        for start in range(n):
            current_sum = 0
            for end in range(start, n):
                current_sum += nums[end]
                subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
        subarray_sums.sort()
        total_sum = 0
        for index in range(left - 1, right):
            total_sum += subarray_sums[index]
        return total_sum % (10**9 + 7)
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements and efficiently managing data structures to achieve the desired results.

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach using prefix sums and binary search, which significantly optimizes the process of calculating subarray sums compared to the brute-force method I initially implemented. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Prefix Sums**: The solution constructs two prefix sum arrays, `B` and `C`. The array `B` holds the cumulative sums of the original array `A`, while `C` holds the cumulative sums of `B`. This allows for quick calculations of subarray sums without needing to iterate through the array multiple times.

2. **Counting Subarray Sums**: The function `count_sum_under(score)` efficiently counts how many subarray sums are less than or equal to a given score using a two-pointer technique. This avoids the need to sort all subarray sums explicitly, which can be computationally expensive.

3. **Binary Search for K-th Score**: The function `kth_score(k)` uses binary search to find the k-th smallest subarray sum. This is a crucial optimization that allows the solution to avoid generating and sorting all subarray sums directly.

4. **Final Calculation**: The result is computed by finding the difference between the sums of subarray sums up to `right` and `left - 1`, which gives the sum of the desired range.

Overall, the official solution is more efficient in both time and space complexity, leveraging mathematical properties of prefix sums and binary search to reduce the problem's complexity. This experience highlights the importance of considering alternative approaches, especially for problems involving combinations and sums, where direct computation can lead to inefficiencies.

INFO - [Task id] 475 [generation text] This function calculates the sum of all subarray sums within a specified range from a given list of integers. It first generates all possible subarray sums and stores them in a list. After sorting this list of sums, it computes the total sum of the elements between the specified left and right indices. Finally, the result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within standard numerical limits. The function efficiently handles the extraction and summation of subarray sums while adhering to the constraints provided.

[Problem]
    Given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continous subarrays fromÂ the array and then sort them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2Â numbers.
    Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in theÂ new array.Â Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
    Output: 13 
    Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 

    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.

    Example 3:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
    Output: 50

Â 
    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
    nums.length == n
    1 <= nums[i] <= 100
    1 <= left <= rightÂ <= n * (n + 1) / 2

            for index in range(left - 1, right):
                total_sum += subarray_sums[index]
        
            # Step 5: Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7
            return total_sum % (10**9 + 7)
