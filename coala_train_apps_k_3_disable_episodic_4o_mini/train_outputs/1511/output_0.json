    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the Problem in Plain English**:\n   Chef has a row of cells where he places magnets, pieces of iron, conducting sheets, and blocked cells. The goal is to determine how many magnets can attract pieces of iron based on a specific attraction formula. The attraction depends on the distance between the magnet and the iron, the number of conducting sheets in between, and a given constant \\( K \\). The attraction is only valid if there are no blocked cells between the magnet and the iron.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a Solution**:\n   - For each test case, we will iterate through the string representing the cells.\n   - We will keep track of the positions of magnets and pieces of iron, as well as the number of conducting sheets encountered.\n   - When we encounter a blocked cell, we will evaluate the attraction between the magnets and iron pieces collected so far, using the attraction formula.\n   - We will count how many valid pairs of magnets and iron can be formed based on the attraction power being greater than zero.\n   - Finally, we will output the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron for each test case.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function solve():\n       read T  // number of test cases\n       for each test case:\n           read N, K  // number of cells and the constant K\n           read S  // the string representing the cells\n           initialize magnets and irons lists\n           initialize count of conducting sheets\n           initialize total pairs count\n           \n           for each character in S:\n               if character is 'M':\n                   add current position to magnets\n               else if character is 'I':\n                   add current position to irons\n               else if character is ':':\n                   increment conducting sheets count\n               else if character is 'X':\n                   // evaluate attraction between magnets and irons\n                   for each magnet in magnets:\n                       for each iron in irons:\n                           calculate attraction power\n                           if attraction power > 0:\n                               increment total pairs count\n                   // reset magnets, irons, and conducting sheets for next segment\n                   clear magnets and irons\n                   reset conducting sheets count\n           \n           // handle any remaining magnets and irons after the last segment\n           evaluate attraction for remaining magnets and irons\n           \n           print total pairs count\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and K\n        index += 1\n        S = data[index]  # Read the string S\n        index += 1\n        \n        magnets = []\n        irons = []\n        conducting_sheets = 0\n        total_pairs = 0\n        \n        for i in range(N):\n            if S[i] == 'M':\n                magnets.append(i)\n            elif S[i] == 'I':\n                irons.append(i)\n            elif S[i] == ':':\n                conducting_sheets += 1\n            elif S[i] == 'X':\n                # Evaluate attraction between magnets and irons\n                for m in magnets:\n                    for j in irons:\n                        attraction_power = K + 1 - abs(j - m) - conducting_sheets\n                        if attraction_power > 0:\n                            total_pairs += 1\n                # Reset for the next segment\n                magnets.clear()\n                irons.clear()\n                conducting_sheets = 0\n        \n        # Handle any remaining magnets and irons after the last segment\n        for m in magnets:\n            for j in irons:\n                attraction_power = K + 1 - abs(j - m) - conducting_sheets\n                if attraction_power > 0:\n                    total_pairs += 1\n        \n        results.append(total_pairs)\n    \n    # Print all results for all test cases\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the code\nsolve()\n```",
