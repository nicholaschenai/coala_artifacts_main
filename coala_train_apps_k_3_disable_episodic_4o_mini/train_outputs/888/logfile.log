You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
codechef
chefcode
3
4
12
1455

-----Sample Output:-----
0
1
181

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a string `S` that is used to create an infinite pyramid of rows. Each row `N` contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner through `S` until the row is filled. We also have another string `T`, and we need to answer several queries about how many times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve the problem, we need to determine the content of the `N`-th row of the pyramid. The row will consist of the first `N` characters of `S`, repeated cyclically. We can calculate the characters in the row using the modulo operation to wrap around the string `S`. Once we have the row, we can count how many times the string `T` appears in it. Given the constraints, we need to ensure our solution is efficient, especially since `N` can be very large (up to 10^9).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
       length_S = length of S
       length_T = length of T
       results = []
       
       for each N in queries:
           # Create the N-th row
           row = ""
           for i from 0 to N-1:
               row += S[i % length_S]
           
           # Count occurrences of T in row
           count = 0
           for i from 0 to (N - length_T):
               if row[i:i + length_T] == T:
                   count += 1

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many rooms in two houses could be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where each box contained a number of tiles equal to its index. The challenge involved ensuring that tiles from a single box were used to tile two rooms, one in each house, and that the total area of the rooms matched the number of tiles.

    The core concept revolved around checking pairs of rooms to see if their combined area equaled the number of tiles in an even-indexed box. The solution involved iterating through all boxes and checking all possible pairs of rooms, which could be computationally expensive given the constraints (up to \(10^{12}\) for N). 

    The initial approach was to use nested loops to check each box and room combination, but this would not scale well for large values of N. However, the provided solution worked correctly for smaller inputs, as evidenced by passing the sample test case.

    In future implementations, a more efficient algorithm would be necessary to handle larger values of N, possibly by leveraging mathematical properties of perfect squares or optimizing the search for room pairs. The final code snippet that worked for the sample input is as follows:

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(N):
        total_rooms = 0
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                for j1 in range(1, N + 1):
                    for j2 in range(1, N + 1):
                        if j1 != j2 and j1 * j1 + j2 * j2 == i:
                            total_rooms += 2
                            break
        return total_rooms

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves creating a pyramid of strings based on a given string `S`. Each row `N` of the pyramid contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner through the string. We need to answer multiple queries about how many times a smaller string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of this pyramid.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve the problem, we need to:
   - Determine the length of the `N`-th row, which is simply `N`.
   - Construct the `N`-th row by taking the first character of `S` and appending characters from `S` in a cyclic manner until we reach the length `N`.
   - Count how many times the string `T` appears in this constructed row. This involves checking all possible starting positions in the row and seeing if the substring matches `T`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_occurrences(row_string, T):
       count = 0
       for i from 0 to length(row_string - length(T)):
           if row_string[i:i+length(T)] == T:
               count += 1
       return count

   function get_row_string(S, N):
       row_string = ""
       for i from 0 to N-1:
           row_string += S[i % length(S)]
       return row_string

   function solve():
       read S
       read T
       read Q
       for each query N:
           row_string = get_row_string(S, N)
           occurrences = count_occurrences(row_string, T)
           print occurrences
   ```

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem involves creating a pyramid of strings based on a given string `S`. Each row `N` of the pyramid contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner through the string. We need to answer multiple queries about how many times a smaller string `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of this pyramid.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve the problem, we need to:
   - Determine the length of the `N`-th row, which is simply `N`.
   - Construct the `N`-th row by taking the first character of `S` and appending characters from `S` in a cyclic manner until we reach the length `N`.
   - Count how many times the string `T` appears in this constructed row. This involves checking all possible starting positions in the row and seeing if the substring matches `T`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_occurrences(row_string, T):
       count = 0
       for i from 0 to length(row_string - length(T)):
           if row_string[i:i+length(T)] == T:
               count += 1
       return count

   function get_row_string(S, N):
       row_string = ""

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
- N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
- Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
- The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
c
co
cod
code
codec
codeco
codecod
codecode
codecodec
codecodeco
...

-----Input:-----
- The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
- Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
- Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

-----Output:-----
- Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

-----Constraints-----
- 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
- 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
- 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

-----Sample Input:-----
codechef
chefcode

-----Explanation:-----
Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

## Instructions
Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] In this problem, the main task was to construct a pyramid of strings based on a given string `S` and answer multiple queries about the occurrences of a smaller string `T` in specific rows of the pyramid. The key concepts involved string manipulation, cyclic indexing, and substring searching.

The solution involved two main functions: one to construct the `N`-th row of the pyramid by cycling through `S`, and another to count the occurrences of `T` in that row. The approach was straightforward, iterating through the row string to check for matches with `T`. 

One important aspect was handling large values for `N` (up to 10^9). However, the solution constructed the row string directly for each query, which could be inefficient for large `N`. In practice, this worked for the provided test cases but could lead to performance issues if `N` were significantly larger. 

The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the logic for substring counting and cyclic string construction was sound. Future improvements could focus on optimizing the row construction to avoid unnecessary string concatenation for large `N`. 

Hereâ€™s the core code snippet for reference:

```python
def count_occurrences(row_string, T):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(row_string) - len(T) + 1):
        if row_string[i:i + len(T)] == T:
            count += 1
    return count

def get_row_string(S, N):
    row_string = ""
    for i in range(N):
        row_string += S[i % len(S)]
    return row_string
``` 

Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of considering performance implications when dealing with potentially large inputs in string manipulation problems.

INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting occurrences of a substring `T` in the `N`-th row of the pyramid formed by string `S`. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **KMP Algorithm for Substring Search**: The solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to preprocess the pattern `T` and efficiently search for its occurrences in the constructed rows. This is more efficient than a naive substring search, especially given the constraints.

2. **Handling Infinite Rows**: Instead of constructing the entire row for large `N`, the solution recognizes that the rows are cyclic. It constructs a doubled version of `S` (i.e., `S + S`) to simulate the cyclic behavior without actually creating a long string. This allows for easier substring searching.

3. **Binary Search for Occurrences**: The solution uses a binary search to count how many times the substring `T` can fit into the row string. This is done by calculating how many complete cycles of `S` fit into `N` and how many additional characters are needed.

4. **Efficient Counting**: The number of occurrences is calculated based on how many times `T` can fit into the complete cycles of `S` and the remainder characters. This avoids the need to explicitly construct large strings, which is crucial given the constraints (up to `10^9` for `N`).

5. **Complexity Considerations**: The use of KMP and binary search significantly reduces the time complexity compared to a naive approach, making it feasible to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.

In summary, the official solution is insightful because it leverages efficient algorithms (KMP and binary search) to handle potentially large inputs without direct string construction, thus optimizing both time and space complexity. This approach is particularly useful in competitive programming scenarios where performance is critical.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 888 [generation text] This function reads input data consisting of a string S, a substring T, and a number of queries Q. For each query, it generates a row string by cycling through S up to a specified length N. It then counts how many times the substring T appears in this generated row string. The results of these counts for each query are collected and printed, one per line. The function effectively handles multiple queries and outputs the corresponding occurrences of T in each generated row string. Overall, it combines string manipulation and counting in response to user-defined queries.

[Problem]
    Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
    - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
    - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
    - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
    He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
    You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
    For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
    c
    co
    cod
    code
    codec
    codeco
    codecod
    codecode
    codecodec
    codecodeco
    ...

    -----Input:-----
    - The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
    - The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
    - Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
    - Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

    -----Output:-----
    - Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

    -----Constraints-----
    - 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
    - 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
    - 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
    - 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

    -----Sample Input:-----
    codechef
    chefcode
    3
    4
    12
    1455

    -----Sample Output:-----
    0
    1
    181

    -----Explanation:-----
    Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
    Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
    Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.
