    "summary": "In this problem, the main task was to construct a pyramid of strings based on a given string `S` and answer multiple queries about the occurrences of a smaller string `T` in specific rows of the pyramid. The key concepts involved string manipulation, cyclic indexing, and substring searching.\n\nThe solution involved two main functions: one to construct the `N`-th row of the pyramid by cycling through `S`, and another to count the occurrences of `T` in that row. The approach was straightforward, iterating through the row string to check for matches with `T`. \n\nOne important aspect was handling large values for `N` (up to 10^9). However, the solution constructed the row string directly for each query, which could be inefficient for large `N`. In practice, this worked for the provided test cases but could lead to performance issues if `N` were significantly larger. \n\nThe final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the logic for substring counting and cyclic string construction was sound. Future improvements could focus on optimizing the row construction to avoid unnecessary string concatenation for large `N`. \n\nHere\u2019s the core code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(row_string, T):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(row_string) - len(T) + 1):\n        if row_string[i:i + len(T)] == T:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\ndef get_row_string(S, N):\n    row_string = \"\"\n    for i in range(N):\n        row_string += S[i % len(S)]\n    return row_string\n``` \n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of considering performance implications when dealing with potentially large inputs in string manipulation problems.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting occurrences of a substring `T` in the `N`-th row of the pyramid formed by string `S`. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **KMP Algorithm for Substring Search**: The solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to preprocess the pattern `T` and efficiently search for its occurrences in the constructed rows. This is more efficient than a naive substring search, especially given the constraints.\n\n2. **Handling Infinite Rows**: Instead of constructing the entire row for large `N`, the solution recognizes that the rows are cyclic. It constructs a doubled version of `S` (i.e., `S + S`) to simulate the cyclic behavior without actually creating a long string. This allows for easier substring searching.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Occurrences**: The solution uses a binary search to count how many times the substring `T` can fit into the row string. This is done by calculating how many complete cycles of `S` fit into `N` and how many additional characters are needed.\n\n4. **Efficient Counting**: The number of occurrences is calculated based on how many times `T` can fit into the complete cycles of `S` and the remainder characters. This avoids the need to explicitly construct large strings, which is crucial given the constraints (up to `10^9` for `N`).\n\n5. **Complexity Considerations**: The use of KMP and binary search significantly reduces the time complexity compared to a naive approach, making it feasible to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.\n\nIn summary, the official solution is insightful because it leverages efficient algorithms (KMP and binary search) to handle potentially large inputs without direct string construction, thus optimizing both time and space complexity. This approach is particularly useful in competitive programming scenarios where performance is critical.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThis function reads input data consisting of a string S, a substring T, and a number of queries Q. For each query, it generates a row string by cycling through S up to a specified length N. It then counts how many times the substring T appears in this generated row string. The results of these counts for each query are collected and printed, one per line. The function effectively handles multiple queries and outputs the corresponding occurrences of T in each generated row string. Overall, it combines string manipulation and counting in response to user-defined queries.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze patterns in cyclic strings, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design. It can be applied in problems involving substring search within generated sequences, especially when the sequences are formed by repeating a base string. This can also be relevant in text processing tasks, where efficient substring counting is required in large datasets or infinite sequences, and in situations where memory constraints prevent the full construction of large strings."
