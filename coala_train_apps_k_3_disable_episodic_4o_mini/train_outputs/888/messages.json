Each row `N` contains `N` characters, starting with the first character of `S` and continuing in a cyclic manner through `S` until the row is filled. We also have another string `T`, and we need to answer several queries about how many times `T` appears as a substring in the `N`-th row of the pyramid.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve the problem, we need to determine the content of the `N`-th row of the pyramid. The row will consist of the first `N` characters of `S`, repeated cyclically. We can calculate the characters in the row using the modulo operation to wrap around the string `S`. Once we have the row, we can count how many times the string `T` appears in it. Given the constraints, we need to ensure our solution is efficient, especially since `N` can be very large (up to 10^9).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n       length_S = length of S\n       length_T = length of T\n       results = []\n       \n       for each N in queries:\n           # Create the N-th row\n           row = \"\"\n           for i from 0 to N-1:\n               row += S[i % length_S]\n           \n           # Count occurrences of T in row\n           count = 0\n           for i from 0 to (N - length_T):\n               if row[i:i + length_T] == T:\n                   count += 1\n           \n           results.append(count)\n       \n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(S, T, queries):\n    # Get the lengths of S and T\n    length_S = len(S)\n    length_T = len(T)\n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each query\n    for N in queries:\n        # Create the N-th row using cyclic pattern\n        row = \"\"\n        for i in range(N):\n            row += S[i % length_S]\n        \n        # Count occurrences of T in the row\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(N - length_T + 1):\n            if row[i:i + length_T] == T:\n                count += 1\n        \n        # Store the result for this query\n        results.append(count)\n    \n    return results\n\n# Read input\nS = input().strip()\nT = input().strip()\nQ = int(input().strip())\nqueries = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(Q)]\n\n# Get the results\nresults = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)\n\n# Print the results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```"

The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine how many rooms in two houses could be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where each box contained a number of tiles equal to its index. The challenge involved ensuring that tiles from a single box were used to tile two rooms, one in each house, and that the total area of the rooms matched the number of tiles.\n\n    The core concept revolved around checking pairs of rooms to see if their combined area equaled the number of tiles in an even-indexed box. The solution involved iterating through all boxes and checking all possible pairs of rooms, which could be computationally expensive given the constraints (up to \\(10^{12}\\) for N). \n\n    The initial approach was to use nested loops to check each box and room combination, but this would not scale well for large values of N. However, the provided solution worked correctly for smaller inputs, as evidenced by passing the sample test case.\n\n    In future implementations, a more efficient algorithm would be necessary to handle larger values of N, possibly by leveraging mathematical properties of perfect squares or optimizing the search for room pairs. The final code snippet that worked for the sample input is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def count_tiled_rooms(N):\n        total_rooms = 0\n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                for j1 in range(1, N + 1):\n                    for j2 in range(1, N + 1):\n                        if j1 != j2 and j1 * j1 + j2 * j2 == i:\n                            total_rooms += 2\n                            break\n        return total_rooms\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary highlights the problem-solving approach, the challenges faced, and the need for optimization in future attempts.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values.

        "content": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting occurrences of a substring `T` in the `N`-th row of the pyramid formed by string `S`. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **KMP Algorithm for Substring Search**: The solution uses the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to preprocess the pattern `T` and efficiently search for its occurrences in the constructed rows. This is more efficient than a naive substring search, especially given the constraints.\n\n2. **Handling Infinite Rows**: Instead of constructing the entire row for large `N`, the solution recognizes that the rows are cyclic. It constructs a doubled version of `S` (i.e., `S + S`) to simulate the cyclic behavior without actually creating a long string. This allows for easier substring searching.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Occurrences**: The solution uses a binary search to count how many times the substring `T` can fit into the row string. This is done by calculating how many complete cycles of `S` fit into `N` and how many additional characters are needed.\n\n4. **Efficient Counting**: The number of occurrences is calculated based on how many times `T` can fit into the complete cycles of `S` and the remainder characters. This avoids the need to explicitly construct large strings, which is crucial given the constraints (up to `10^9` for `N`).\n\n5. **Complexity Considerations**: The use of KMP and binary search significantly reduces the time complexity compared to a naive approach, making it feasible to handle the upper limits of the input constraints.\n\nIn summary, the official solution is insightful because it leverages efficient algorithms (KMP and binary search) to handle potentially large inputs without direct string construction, thus optimizing both time and space complexity. This approach is particularly useful in competitive programming scenarios where performance is critical."

        "content": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThis function reads input data consisting of a string S, a substring T, and a number of queries Q. For each query, it generates a row string by cycling through S up to a specified length N. It then counts how many times the substring T appears in this generated row string. The results of these counts for each query are collected and printed, one per line. The function effectively handles multiple queries and outputs the corresponding occurrences of T in each generated row string. Overall, it combines string manipulation and counting in response to user-defined queries.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze patterns in cyclic strings, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design. It can be applied in problems involving substring search within generated sequences, especially when the sequences are formed by repeating a base string. This can also be relevant in text processing tasks, where efficient substring counting is required in large datasets or infinite sequences, and in situations where memory constraints prevent the full construction of large strings."
