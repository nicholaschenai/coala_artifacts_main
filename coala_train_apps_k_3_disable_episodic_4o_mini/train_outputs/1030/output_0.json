    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We have an infinite binary tree where each node has a specific structure based on its label. Given two nodes `u` and `v`, we need to find out how many pairs of nodes `(w, t)` exist such that the path taken to traverse from `w` to `t` is the same as the path taken from `u` to `v`. The input consists of multiple queries, each specifying the maximum node label `n` and the two nodes `u` and `v`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we need to determine the path from `u` to `v` in the binary tree. This involves finding the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of `u` and `v`, which will help us understand how many nodes are on the path from `u` to `v`. Once we have the LCA, we can count how many nodes can be paired with `u` and `v` that share the same path configuration. The number of valid pairs `(w, t)` can be derived from the number of nodes that can be reached from the LCA to `n`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_lca(u, v):\n       while u != v:\n           if u > v:\n               u = u // 2\n           else:\n               v = v // 2\n       return u\n\n   function count_pairs(n, u, v):\n       lca = find_lca(u, v)\n       # Count nodes from lca to n\n       count_from_lca = n - lca + 1\n       # Total pairs (w, t) = count_from_lca * count_from_lca\n       return count_from_lca * count_from_lca\n\n   function solve():\n       read number of queries Q\n       for each query:\n           read n, u, v\n           result = count_pairs(n, u, v)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_lca(u, v):\n    # This function finds the lowest common ancestor of u and v\n    while u != v:\n        if u > v:\n            u //= 2  # Move u to its parent\n        else:\n            v //= 2  # Move v to its parent\n    return u  # When u equals v, we found the LCA\n\ndef count_pairs(n, u, v):\n    # Find the lowest common ancestor of u and v\n    lca = find_lca(u, v)\n    # Count how many nodes can be reached from lca to n\n    count_from_lca = n - lca + 1\n    # The total pairs (w, t) is the square of the count_from_lca\n    return count_from_lca * count_from_lca\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    Q = int(data[0])  # Read number of queries\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, Q + 1):\n        n, u, v = map(int, data[i].split())  # Read each query\n        result = count_pairs(n, u, v)  # Calculate the result for the query\n        results.append(result)  # Store the result\n    \n    # Print all results, each on a new line\n    sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\nsolve()\n```",
