When a student solves a question of a certain complexity, their score is multiplied by that complexity. Given multiple questions and the range of students who can solve them, we need to calculate the mean of the maximum scores of all students after all questions have been assigned.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution:**\n   - Start by initializing a list of scores for all students, each set to 10.\n   - For each question, update the scores of the specified range of students by multiplying their current score by the complexity of the question.\n   - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores and return the floor value of that mean.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N, M\n           initialize scores list with 10 for each student\n           for each question in M:\n               read i, j, k\n               for student in range(i to j):\n                   scores[student] *= k\n           mean_score = sum(scores) // N\n           print mean_score\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 solution:**\n```python\ndef calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, M = case[0]\n        scores = [10] * N  # Initialize scores for N students\n        for question in case[1]:\n            i, j, k = question\n            for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Adjusting for 0-based index\n                scores[student] *= k\n        mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Calculate floor of mean\n        results.append(mean_score)\n    \n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# Reading input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().splitlines()\n\nT = int(data[0])\ntest_cases = []\nindex = 1\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, M = map(int, data[index].split())\n    index += 1\n    questions = []\n    for _ in range(M):\n        i, j, k = map(int, data[index].split())\n        questions.append((i, j, k))\n        index += 1\n    test_cases.append(((N, M), questions))\n\ncalculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases)\n```"

The approach involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the current arrangement, as the books not in this subsequence would need to be moved.\n\n    The solution utilized a dynamic programming technique to compute the LIS. The key steps included initializing an array to track the lengths of increasing subsequences and iterating through the books to update these lengths based on comparisons. The final result was derived by subtracting the length of the LIS from the total number of books.\n\n    The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test case. The main takeaway is the effectiveness of the LIS approach in minimizing moves for sorting problems, which can be applied to similar scenarios involving permutations and orderings. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n        lis = [1] * N\n        for i in range(1, N):\n            for j in range(i):\n                if books[i] > books[j]:\n                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)\n        longest_increasing_length = max(lis)\n        return N - longest_increasing_length\n\n    N = int(input())\n    books = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))\n    ``` \n\n    This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Continued fractions\n    Part: 12/12\n    ```\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            def solve(p, q, N):\n                return p * N * (N + 1) // 2 - q * sum_floor(fraction(p, q), N)\n            ``` \n\n    !!! example \"[Library Checker - Sum of Floor of Linear](https://judge.yosupo.jp/problem/sum_of_floor_of_linear)\"\n        Given $N$, $M$, $A$ and $B$, compute $\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{N-1} \\lfloor \\frac{A \\cdot i + B}{M} \\rfloor$.\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.\n\n        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \\frac{Ax+B}{M}$.\n\n        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$.

Unfortunately, unlike the previous problem, you need to make sure that you don't cross the $y=\\frac{Ax+B}{C}$ line while getting closer to it, so you should keep it in mind when calculating semiconvergent's coefficient $t$.\n\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # (x, y) such that y = (A*x+B) // C,\n            # Cy - Ax is max and 0 <= x <= N.\n            def closest(A, B, C, N):\n                # y <= (A*x + B)/C <=> diff(x, y) <= B\n                def diff(x, y):\n                    return C*y-A*x\n                a = fraction(A, C)\n                p, q = convergents(a)\n                ph = [B // C]\n                qh = [0]\n                for i in range(2, len(q) - 1):\n                    if i % 2 == 0:\n                        while diff(qh[-1] + q[i+1], ph[-1] + p[i+1]) <= B:\n                            t = 1 + (diff(qh[-1] + q[i-1], ph[-1] + p[i-1]) - B - 1) // abs(diff(q[i], p[i]))\n                            dp = p[i-1] + t*p[i]\n                            dq = q[i-1] + t*q[i]\n                            k = (N - qh[-1]) // dq\n                            if k == 0:\n                                return qh[-1], ph[-1]\n                            if diff(dq, dp) != 0:\n                                k = min(k, (B - diff(qh[-1], ph[-1])) // diff(dq, dp))\n                            qh.append(qh[-1] + k*dq)\n                            ph.append(ph[-1] + k*dp)\n                return qh[-1], ph[-1]\n\n            def solve(A, B, N):\n                x, y = closest(A, N % A, B, N // A)\n                return N // A - x, y\n            ```\n\n    !!! example \"[June Challenge 2017 - Euler Sum](https://www.codechef.com/problems/ES)\"\n        Compute $\\sum\\limits_{x=1}^N \\lfloor ex \\rfloor$, where $e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, \\dots, 1, 2n, 1, \\dots]$ is the Euler's number and $N \\leq 10^{4000}$.\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n        This sum is equal to the number of lattice point $(x;y)$ such that $1 \\leq x \\leq N$ and $1 \\leq y \\leq ex$.    \n\n        After constructing the convex hull of the points below $y=ex$, this number can be computed using [Pick's theorem](../geometry/picks-theorem.md):\n\n        === \"C++\"\n            ```cpp\n            // sum floor(k * x) for k in [1, N] and x = [a0; a1, a2, ...]\n            int sum_floor(auto a, int N) {\n                N++;\n                auto [ah, ph, qh] = hull(a, N);\n\n                // The number of lattice points within a vertical right trapezoid\n                // on points (0; 0) - (0; y1) - (dx; y2) - (dx; 0) that has\n                // a+1 integer points on the segment (0; y1) - (dx; y2).\n                auto picks = [](int y1, int y2, int dx, int a) {\n                    int b = y1 + y2 + a + dx;\n                    int A = (y1 + y2) * dx;\n                    return (A - b + 2) / 2 + b - (y2 + 1);\n                };\n\n                int ans = 0;\n                for(size_t i = 1; i < qh.size(); i++) {\n                    ans += picks(ph[i - 1], ph[i], qh[i] - qh[i - 1], ah[i - 1]);\n                }\n                return ans - N;\n            }\n            ```\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # sum floor(k * x) for k in [1, N] and x = [a0; a1, a2, ...]\n            def sum_floor(a, N):\n                N += 1\n                ah, ph, qh = hull(a, N)\n\n                # The number of lattice points within a vertical right trapezoid\n                # on points (0; 0) - (0; y1) - (dx; y2) - (dx; 0) that has\n                # a+1 integer points on the segment (0; y1) - (dx; y2).\n                def picks(y1, y2, dx, a):\n                    b = y1 + y2 + a + dx\n                    A = (y1 + y2) * dx\n                    return (A - b + 2) // 2 + b - (y2 + 1)\n\n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(1, len(qh)):\n                    ans += picks(ph[i-1], ph[i], qh[i]-qh[i-1], ah[i-1])\n                return ans - N\n            ``` \n\n    !!! example \"[NAIPC 2019 - It's a Mod, Mod, Mod, Mod World](https://open.kattis.com/problems/itsamodmodmodmodworld)\"\n        Given $p$, $q$ and $n$, compute $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n [p \\cdot i \\bmod q]$.\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n        This problem reduces to the previous one if you note that $a \\bmod b = a - \\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\rfloor b$.

Each student starts with a score of 10, and if they solve a question of complexity `k`, their score is multiplied by `k`. Given multiple questions and the range of students who can solve them, we need to calculate the mean of the maximum scores of all students after all questions have been assigned.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution:**\n   - Initialize an array to hold the scores of all students, starting with a score of 10 for each.\n   - For each question, update the scores of the students in the specified range by multiplying their scores by the complexity of the question.\n   - After processing all questions, calculate the mean of the scores by summing them up and dividing by the number of students, then take the floor of that value.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           N, M = test_case[0]\n           scores = [10] * N\n           for each question in test_case[1]:\n               i, j, k = question\n               for student in range(i-1, j):  # Adjust for 0-based index\n                   scores[student] *= k\n           mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Floor division\n           print(mean_score)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 solution:**\n```python\ndef calculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases):\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        N, M = test_case[0]\n        scores = [10] * N  # Initialize scores for N students\n        for question in test_case[1]:\n            i, j, k = question\n            for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Adjust for 0-based index\n                scores[student] *= k  # Update scores based on complexity\n        mean_score = sum(scores) // N  # Calculate mean and take floor\n        print(mean_score)  # Output the result\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.read\ndata = input().splitlines()\n\nT = int(data[0])  # Number of test cases\nindex = 1\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, M = map(int, data[index].split())\n    index += 1\n    questions = []\n    for __ in range(M):\n        i, j, k = map(int, data[index].split())\n        questions.append((i, j, k))\n        index += 1\n    test_cases.append(((N, M), questions))\n\ncalculate_mean_scores(T, test_cases)\n```"

Each student starts with a score of 10, and their score is multiplied by the complexity of the questions they solve. The challenge involved efficiently updating scores for potentially large numbers of students and questions.\n\nThe core concept tested was the ability to manipulate an array of scores based on given ranges and multipliers. The solution involved initializing an array of scores, iterating through the questions, and updating the scores for the specified range of students. After processing all questions, the mean score was calculated using integer division to ensure the floor value was returned.\n\nThe implemented solution was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints, as it directly updated scores in a single pass for each question. The final code successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the approach was sound. \n\nKey code snippet:\n```python\nfor question in test_case[1]:\n    i, j, k = question\n    for student in range(i - 1, j):  # Adjust for 0-based index\n        scores[student] *= k  # Update scores based on complexity\n```\n\nThis experience reinforced the importance of understanding how to efficiently manipulate data structures and perform calculations based on specified conditions."

        "content": "The official solution employs a dictionary to track the scores of students, which allows for dynamic updates without needing to initialize a fixed-size array. This approach is particularly useful when the number of students (`N`) is large, but not all students are affected by the questions, as it avoids unnecessary memory allocation for students who do not participate.\n\nKey insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Dynamic Score Tracking**: Instead of initializing an array of size `N`, the solution uses a dictionary (`d`) to store scores only for students who have been affected by the questions. This is efficient in terms of space, especially when `N` is large but `M` (the number of questions) is relatively small.\n\n2. **Two-Pass Update**: The solution first ensures that all students in the specified range have an initial score of 10. It then performs a second pass to multiply the scores by the complexity `k`. This two-step approach simplifies the logic and ensures that all students are initialized before any updates are made.\n\n3. **Final Score Calculation**: After processing all questions, the solution sums the scores stored in the dictionary and divides by `N` to get the mean score, using integer division to achieve the floor value directly.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: The use of a try-except block allows the program to handle unexpected input gracefully, although in a competitive programming context, this might not be necessary.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity compared to the initial approach, which used a fixed-size list. The dictionary-based method is particularly advantageous when dealing with sparse updates across a large range of indices. \n\nIn future implementations, I will consider using dictionaries for similar problems where not all elements need to be initialized or updated, as it can lead to more efficient solutions."
