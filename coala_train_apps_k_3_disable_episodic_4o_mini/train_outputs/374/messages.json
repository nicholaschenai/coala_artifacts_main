i < S.size(); i++)\n            sa_extend(S[i]);\n \n        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {\n            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st[v].link ;\n                l = st[v].len;\n            }\n            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st [v].next[T[i]];\n                l++;\n            }\n            if (l > best) {\n                best = l;\n                bestpos = i;\n            }\n        }\n        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);\n    } \n    ```\n\n    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings\n\n    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.\n    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.\n\n    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):\n\n    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \\dots + S_k + D_k.$$\n\n    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.\n\n    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.\n    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \\dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \\dots, D_k$.\n\n    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.\n    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.\n    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Suffix Automaton\n    Part: 5/7\n    ```\n\n    While this is also $O(length(S))$, it requires no extra space and no recursive calls, consequently running faster in practice.\n\n    ### Total length of all different substrings\n\n    Given a string $S$.\n    We want to compute the total length of all its various substrings.\n\n    The solution is similar to the previous one, only now it is necessary to consider two quantities for the dynamic programming part:\n    the number of different substrings $d[v]$ and their total length $ans[v]$.\n\n    We already described how to compute $d[v]$ in the previous task.\n    The value $ans[v]$ can be computed using the recursion:\n\n    $$ans[v] = \\sum_{w : (v, w, c) \\in DAWG} d[w] + ans[w]$$\n\n    We take the answer of each adjacent vertex $w$, and add to it $d[w]$ (since every substrings is one character longer when starting from the state $v$).\n\n    Again this task can be computed in $O(length(S))$ time.\n\n    Alternatively, we can, again, take advantage of the fact that each state $v$ matches to substrings of length $[minlen(v),len(v)]$.\n    Since $minlen(v) = 1 + len(link(v))$ and the arithmetic series formula $S_n = n \\cdot \\frac{a_1+a_n}{2}$ (where $S_n$ denotes the sum of $n$ terms, $a_1$ representing the first term, and $a_n$ representing the last), we can compute the length of substrings at a state in constant time.  We then sum up these totals for each state $v \\neq t_0$ in the automaton. This is shown by the code below:\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long get_tot_len_diff_substings() {\n        long long tot = 0;\n        for(int i = 1; i < sz; i++) {\n            long long shortest = st[st[i].link].len + 1;\n            long long longest = st[i].len;\n        \n            long long num_strings = longest - shortest + 1;\n            long long cur = num_strings * (longest + shortest) / 2;\n            tot += cur;\n        }\n        return tot;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of finding the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array by jumping according to specific rules, I initially implemented a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The main challenge was ensuring that the jump validity checks were correctly implemented, particularly the requirement that all intermediate values between the starting and destination indices must be less than the value at the starting index.\n\n    Initially, the code failed to account for all valid paths due to incorrect jump validity checks and an inefficient counting mechanism. The use of a visited set was appropriate to prevent revisiting indices, but it led to missed paths when not managed correctly.\n\n    The successful strategy involved implementing memoization to store results for previously computed indices, which significantly improved efficiency and ensured that all valid paths were explored. The final implementation correctly checks both left and right jumps within the allowed distance and verifies that all intermediate values meet the required conditions.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:\n            memo = {}\n        \n            def dfs(index):\n                if index in memo:\n                    return memo[index]\n            \n                max_count = 1\n            \n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index + x < len(arr) and arr[index] > arr[index + x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))\n            \n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index - x >= 0 and arr[index] > arr[index - x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x))\n            \n                memo[index] = max_count\n                return max_count\n\n            max_jumps = 0\n            for index in range(len(arr)):\n                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index))\n            return max_jumps\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing state in recursive functions and the benefits of memoization in optimizing performance.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the shortest superstring that contains all the strings in the list as substrings. The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issues**:\n   - The merging logic in the `merge` function only considers the overlap from the end of one string to the beginning of another. However, it does not account for the possibility of merging in the reverse order or finding the best overall combination of strings.\n   - The `merge_all` function attempts to merge strings iteratively, but it may not always yield the optimal result because it only looks for the best pair of strings to merge at each step without considering the overall arrangement of all strings.\n   - The permutations of the strings are generated, but the merging process does not guarantee that the shortest superstring is found since it may not explore all possible combinations effectively.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   - The merging strategy is not comprehensive enough. It should consider all possible ways to merge strings, not just the best pair at each step.\n   - The logic for checking overlaps and merging could be improved to ensure that we are always forming the shortest possible string.\n   - The output format should be checked to ensure it matches the expected output, especially regarding quotation marks.\n\nTo fix these issues, I will revise the merging logic to ensure that it effectively combines strings based on maximum overlaps and explores all possible combinations more thoroughly. \n\nHere\u2019s the revised approach:\n\n1. Create a function to calculate the maximum overlap between two strings.\n2. Use a recursive approach to explore all combinations of strings, merging them based on the maximum overlap.\n3.

The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.\n\n    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n            total_weight = sum(stones)\n            target = total_weight // 2\n            dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n            dp[0] = True\n\n            for stone in stones:\n                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n\n            for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n                if dp[j]:\n                    return total_weight - 2 * j\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum\n\n    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).\n\n    ## Problem statement\n\n    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \\ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \\ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:\n\n    $$ \\max_{ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.\n    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\n    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.\n\n    ## Algorithm 1\n\n    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm is very simple.\n\n    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.\n\n    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \\ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.\n\n    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.\n\n    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.\n\n    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ \u2014 we will only need the current element from it.\n\n    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.\n\n    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        int cur = sum - min_sum;\n        if (cur > ans) {\n            ans = cur;\n            ans_l = min_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < min_sum) {\n            min_sum = sum;\n            min_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Algorithm 2\n\n    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.\n\n    **Proof:**\n\n    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum \u2014 so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.\n\n    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.\n\n    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a \"critical\" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \\ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.\n\n    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum);\n        sum = max(sum, 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        if (sum > ans) {\n            ans = sum;\n            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < 0) {\n            sum = 0;\n            minus_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

i < S.size(); i++)\n            sa_extend(S[i]);\n \n        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {\n            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st[v].link ;\n                l = st[v].len;\n            }\n            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st [v].next[T[i]];\n                l++;\n            }\n            if (l > best) {\n                best = l;\n                bestpos = i;\n            }\n        }\n        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);\n    } \n    ```\n\n    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings\n\n    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.\n    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.\n\n    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):\n\n    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \\dots + S_k + D_k.$$\n\n    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.\n\n    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.\n    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \\dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \\dots, D_k$.\n\n    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.\n    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.\n    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Suffix Automaton\n    Part: 5/7\n    ```\n\n    While this is also $O(length(S))$, it requires no extra space and no recursive calls, consequently running faster in practice.\n\n    ### Total length of all different substrings\n\n    Given a string $S$.\n    We want to compute the total length of all its various substrings.\n\n    The solution is similar to the previous one, only now it is necessary to consider two quantities for the dynamic programming part:\n    the number of different substrings $d[v]$ and their total length $ans[v]$.\n\n    We already described how to compute $d[v]$ in the previous task.\n    The value $ans[v]$ can be computed using the recursion:\n\n    $$ans[v] = \\sum_{w : (v, w, c) \\in DAWG} d[w] + ans[w]$$\n\n    We take the answer of each adjacent vertex $w$, and add to it $d[w]$ (since every substrings is one character longer when starting from the state $v$).\n\n    Again this task can be computed in $O(length(S))$ time.\n\n    Alternatively, we can, again, take advantage of the fact that each state $v$ matches to substrings of length $[minlen(v),len(v)]$.\n    Since $minlen(v) = 1 + len(link(v))$ and the arithmetic series formula $S_n = n \\cdot \\frac{a_1+a_n}{2}$ (where $S_n$ denotes the sum of $n$ terms, $a_1$ representing the first term, and $a_n$ representing the last), we can compute the length of substrings at a state in constant time.  We then sum up these totals for each state $v \\neq t_0$ in the automaton. This is shown by the code below:\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long get_tot_len_diff_substings() {\n        long long tot = 0;\n        for(int i = 1; i < sz; i++) {\n            long long shortest = st[st[i].link].len + 1;\n            long long longest = st[i].len;\n        \n            long long num_strings = longest - shortest + 1;\n            long long cur = num_strings * (longest + shortest) / 2;\n            tot += cur;\n        }\n        return tot;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The output can be any valid shortest superstring, not necessarily in the order of the input strings.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issues**:\n   - The current implementation merges strings based on the maximum overlap but does not consider the order of merging effectively. The order in which strings are merged can significantly affect the final result.\n   - The merging logic does not account for the possibility of different arrangements of the strings leading to a shorter superstring.

The main challenge was ensuring that the jump validity checks were correctly implemented, particularly the requirement that all intermediate values between the starting and destination indices must be less than the value at the starting index.\n\n    Initially, the code failed to account for all valid paths due to incorrect jump validity checks and an inefficient counting mechanism. The use of a visited set was appropriate to prevent revisiting indices, but it led to missed paths when not managed correctly.\n\n    The successful strategy involved implementing memoization to store results for previously computed indices, which significantly improved efficiency and ensured that all valid paths were explored. The final implementation correctly checks both left and right jumps within the allowed distance and verifies that all intermediate values meet the required conditions.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:\n            memo = {}\n        \n            def dfs(index):\n                if index in memo:\n                    return memo[index]\n            \n                max_count = 1\n            \n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index + x < len(arr) and arr[index] > arr[index + x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))\n            \n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index - x >= 0 and arr[index] > arr[index - x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x))\n            \n                memo[index] = max_count\n                return max_count\n\n            max_jumps = 0\n            for index in range(len(arr)):\n                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index))\n            return max_jumps\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing state in recursive functions and the benefits of memoization in optimizing performance.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Suffix Automaton\n    Part: 5/7\n    ```\n\n    While this is also $O(length(S))$, it requires no extra space and no recursive calls, consequently running faster in practice.\n\n    ### Total length of all different substrings\n\n    Given a string $S$.\n    We want to compute the total length of all its various substrings.\n\n    The solution is similar to the previous one, only now it is necessary to consider two quantities for the dynamic programming part:\n    the number of different substrings $d[v]$ and their total length $ans[v]$.\n\n    We already described how to compute $d[v]$ in the previous task.\n    The value $ans[v]$ can be computed using the recursion:\n\n    $$ans[v] = \\sum_{w : (v, w, c) \\in DAWG} d[w] + ans[w]$$\n\n    We take the answer of each adjacent vertex $w$, and add to it $d[w]$ (since every substrings is one character longer when starting from the state $v$).\n\n    Again this task can be computed in $O(length(S))$ time.\n\n    Alternatively, we can, again, take advantage of the fact that each state $v$ matches to substrings of length $[minlen(v),len(v)]$.\n    Since $minlen(v) = 1 + len(link(v))$ and the arithmetic series formula $S_n = n \\cdot \\frac{a_1+a_n}{2}$ (where $S_n$ denotes the sum of $n$ terms, $a_1$ representing the first term, and $a_n$ representing the last), we can compute the length of substrings at a state in constant time.  We then sum up these totals for each state $v \\neq t_0$ in the automaton. This is shown by the code below:\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long get_tot_len_diff_substings() {\n        long long tot = 0;\n        for(int i = 1; i < sz; i++) {\n            long long shortest = st[st[i].link].len + 1;\n            long long longest = st[i].len;\n        \n            long long num_strings = longest - shortest + 1;\n            long long cur = num_strings * (longest + shortest) / 2;\n            tot += cur;\n        }\n        return tot;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

However, the approach failed to account for the order of merging, which is crucial for achieving the shortest result. \n\nThe core concept tested in this problem is the ability to efficiently merge strings while maximizing overlaps, which can significantly reduce the length of the resulting superstring. The strategy of using permutations was sound, but the merging logic needed to be more comprehensive to explore all possible combinations effectively.\n\nOne key error was not considering that different orders of merging could yield different results. For example, merging \"loves\" and \"alex\" first could lead to a shorter superstring than merging \"alex\" and \"loves\" first. This oversight led to incorrect outputs in tests.\n\nIn future attempts, a more robust backtracking approach that explores all combinations of merging strings while keeping track of overlaps would be beneficial. Additionally, ensuring that the merging logic is flexible enough to handle various arrangements will be crucial for solving similar problems effectively.\n\nHere\u2019s a concise version of the merging logic that was used:\n\n```python\ndef max_overlap(s1, s2):\n    max_len = 0\n    for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n        if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n            max_len = i\n    return max_len\n\ndef merge(s1, s2):\n    overlap = max_overlap(s1, s2)\n    return s1 + s2[overlap:]\n```\n\nThis logic is essential for merging strings based on their overlaps, but it needs to be integrated into a more comprehensive solution that considers all possible orders of merging."

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of finding the shortest superstring, I learned several key insights that highlight the differences between my approach and the official solution.\n\n1. **Handling Overlaps**: My initial implementation focused on merging strings based on maximum overlaps but did not effectively explore all possible combinations of string arrangements. The official solution uses a more systematic approach by defining a `merge` function that checks for overlaps in a more comprehensive manner, ensuring that the best possible merge is achieved.\n\n2. **Memoization**: The official solution employs memoization to optimize the recursive function that finds the shortest superstring. This technique significantly reduces redundant calculations by storing previously computed results, which I did not implement in my solution. This is crucial for improving performance, especially given the potential exponential number of combinations.\n\n3. **Tuple Representation**: The official solution uses tuples to represent the indices of the strings being processed, which simplifies the management of remaining strings during recursion. This contrasts with my approach, which directly manipulated lists, leading to more complex logic and potential inefficiencies.\n\n4. **Final Selection**: The official solution efficiently finds the minimum length superstring by evaluating all possible starting points and using the `min` function to select the shortest result. My approach did not adequately ensure that all permutations were considered in a way that guaranteed the shortest output.\n\n### Key Code Snippets from the Official Solution\n- **Merge Function**:\n    ```python\n    def merge(w1, w2):\n        for k in range(len(w2), -1, -1):\n            if w1.endswith(w2[:k]):\n                return w1 + w2[k:]\n    ```\n\n- **Memoization Decorator**:\n    ```python\n    def memo(f):\n        dic = {}\n        def f_alt(*args):\n            if args not in dic:\n                dic[args] = f(*args)\n            return dic[args]\n        return f_alt\n    ```\n\n- **Recursive Function**:\n    ```python\n    @memo\n    def find_short(tup, last):\n        if len(tup) == 1:\n            return A[tup[0]]\n        mtup = tuple(t for t in tup if t != last)\n        return min((merge(find_short(mtup, t), A[last]) for t in mtup), key=len)\n    ```\n\nOverall, the official solution's use of memoization, efficient merging, and tuple management provides a more effective and optimized approach to solving the problem, highlighting areas for improvement in my own coding strategies."
