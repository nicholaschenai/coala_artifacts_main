## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find a permutation of the numbers from 1 to N such that when we calculate a specific function `f(P)`, it equals a given integer K. The function `f(P)` is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. If no such permutation exists for the given N and K, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function `f(P)` behaves. The maximum value of `f(P)` occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the maximum possible sum of adjacent maximums. Conversely, the minimum value of `f(P)` occurs when the permutation is in ascending order, which results in a sum of 0. We can derive the maximum possible value of `f(P)` for a given N as follows:
   - The maximum value is `N * (N - 1) / 2`, which is the sum of the first N-1 integers.
   - If K is greater than this maximum value or less than 0, we return -1.
   - If K is achievable, we can construct the permutation by starting with the descending order and adjusting it to reach the desired K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case
           max_f = N * (N - 1) // 2
           if K > max_f or K < 0:
               print -1

               for i from 1 to N-1:
                   if current_f == K:

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to compute the maximum strength of an army formed from a list of distinct Pok√©mon strengths using an alternating sum. The alternating sum is defined as \( a[b_1] - a[b_2] + a[b_3] - a[b_4] + \ldots \). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the strengths provided.

    Initially, I attempted to sort the strengths in descending order and calculate the alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, this approach did not yield the correct results, as it failed to account for the optimal selection of strengths that would maximize the alternating sum.

    The key insight was that the maximum strength can be achieved by carefully selecting the largest strengths for positive contributions and the next largest for negative contributions. The correct approach involves sorting the strengths and then calculating the alternating sum based on their sorted order.

    Despite multiple attempts to fix the code, the output consistently failed to match the expected results. The final code structure was as follows:

    ```python
    def max_strength(test_cases):
        results = []
        for _ in range(test_cases):
            n, q = map(int, input().split())
            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
        
            max_strength = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    max_strength += strengths[i]
                else:
                    max_strength -= strengths[i]
        
            results.append(max_strength)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    t = int(input())
    max_strength(t)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and ensuring that the logic aligns with the goal of maximizing the alternating sum. The errors encountered were primarily due to miscalculating the contributions of strengths based on their order.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. 

    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach of generating all possible strings by removing and reinserting characters was effective, and the use of comparisons to track the smallest string worked as intended.

    The final implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each string, and outputting the results. The code was structured to first define the main function and then handle input/output, ensuring clarity and separation of logic. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. 

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    for i in range(N):  # Iterate through each character
        char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to move
        remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remove the character
        for j in range(N):  # Try to insert the character at every position
            new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]
            if new_string < smallest_string:  # Check if the new string is smaller
                smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of string manipulation techniques and careful iteration when solving combinatorial problems.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here‚Äôs the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.

   The task is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given integer K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. If K is greater than this maximum, we return -1. If K is less than or equal to this maximum, we can construct a permutation that achieves K by adjusting the order of the numbers. Specifically, we can start with the descending order and make small adjustments to reduce the sum to K.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given integer K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. If K is greater than this maximum, we return -1. If K is less than or equal to this maximum, we can construct a permutation that achieves K by adjusting the order of the numbers. Specifically, we can start with the descending order and make small adjustments to reduce the sum to K.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. This means that the maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N + (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 2 = N(N-1)/2\).

2. **Identifying the maximum value**:
   The maximum value of f(P) is actually \(N(N-1)/2\), not \((N * (N + 1)) // 2 - N\) as previously stated. This means that if K is greater than this maximum value, we should return -1.

3. **Constructing the permutation**:
   The approach to construct the permutation to achieve a specific K was flawed. The logic for adjusting the permutation to reach K was not correctly implemented. Specifically, the way to reduce the sum by swapping elements or adjusting them was not properly handled.

4. **Correcting the approach**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given integer K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. If K is greater than this maximum, we return -1. If K is less than or equal to this maximum, we can construct a permutation that achieves K by adjusting the order of the numbers. Specifically, we can start with the descending order and make small adjustments to reduce the sum to K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. This means that the maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N + (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 2 = N(N-1)/2\).

2. **Identifying the maximum value**:
   The maximum value of f(P) is actually \(N(N-1)/2\), not \((N * (N + 1)) // 2 - N\) as previously stated. This means that if K is greater than this maximum value, we should return -1.

3. **Constructing the permutation**:
   The approach to construct the permutation to achieve a specific K was flawed. The logic for adjusting the permutation to reach K was not correctly implemented. Specifically, the way to reduce the sum by swapping elements or adjusting them was not properly handled.

4. **Correcting the approach**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            # Start with descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_value
            
            # Adjust the permutation to reach K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the maximum we can reduce the current pair
                max_reduce = min(permutation[i] - 1, current_sum - K)
                if max_reduce > 0:
                    # Reduce the current element
                    permutation[i] -= max_reduce
                    current_sum -= max_reduce
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    # Print all results for all test cases
    print("\n".join(map(str, results)))

# Read input and call the function
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read

T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_permutation(T, test_cases)
``` 

### Key Changes:
- Corrected the calculation of the maximum possible value of f(P).

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to compute the maximum strength of an army formed from a list of distinct Pok√©mon strengths using an alternating sum. The alternating sum is defined as \( a[b_1] - a[b_2] + a[b_3] - a[b_4] + \ldots \). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the strengths provided.

    Initially, I attempted to sort the strengths in descending order and calculate the alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, this approach did not yield the correct results, as it failed to account for the optimal selection of strengths that would maximize the alternating sum.

    The key insight was that the maximum strength can be achieved by carefully selecting the largest strengths for positive contributions and the next largest for negative contributions. The correct approach involves sorting the strengths and then calculating the alternating sum based on their sorted order.

    Despite multiple attempts to fix the code, the output consistently failed to match the expected results. The final code structure was as follows:

    ```python
    def max_strength(test_cases):
        results = []
        for _ in range(test_cases):
            n, q = map(int, input().split())
            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
        
            max_strength = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    max_strength += strengths[i]
                else:
                    max_strength -= strengths[i]
        
            results.append(max_strength)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    t = int(input())
    max_strength(t)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and ensuring that the logic aligns with the goal of maximizing the alternating sum. The errors encountered were primarily due to miscalculating the contributions of strengths based on their order.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here‚Äôs the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The approach involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the current arrangement, as the books not in this subsequence would need to be moved.

    The solution utilized a dynamic programming technique to compute the LIS. The key steps included initializing an array to track the lengths of increasing subsequences and iterating through the books to update these lengths based on comparisons. The final result was derived by subtracting the length of the LIS from the total number of books.

    The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test case. The main takeaway is the effectiveness of the LIS approach in minimizing moves for sorting problems, which can be applied to similar scenarios involving permutations and orderings. 

    Here‚Äôs the core code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
        lis = [1] * N
        for i in range(1, N):
            for j in range(i):
                if books[i] > books[j]:
                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)
        longest_increasing_length = max(lis)
        return N - longest_increasing_length

    N = int(input())
    books = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))
    ``` 

    This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Based on the insights gained from the previous attempts and the understanding of the problem, I will now provide a corrected solution for the permutation problem. The key points to address are:

1. **Correct Calculation of Maximum f(P)**: The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N(N-1)/2\).
2. **Constructing the Permutation**: We need to start with the descending order and adjust it to reach the desired K by carefully modifying the permutation.

Here‚Äôs the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input Handling**: The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- **Maximum Calculation**: It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a descending permutation.
- **Permutation Construction**: It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired K by reducing elements appropriately.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This implementation should now correctly handle the test cases and produce the expected results.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given integer K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. If K is greater than this maximum, we return -1. If K is less than or equal to this maximum, we can construct a permutation that achieves K by adjusting the order of the numbers. Specifically, we can start with the descending order and make small adjustments to reduce the sum to K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. This means that the maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N + (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 2 = N(N-1)/2\).

2. **Identifying the maximum value**:
   The maximum value of f(P) is actually \(N(N-1)/2\), not \((N * (N + 1)) // 2 - N\) as previously stated. This means that if K is greater than this maximum value, we should return -1.

3. **Constructing the permutation**:
   The approach to construct the permutation to achieve a specific K was flawed. The logic for adjusting the permutation to reach K was not correctly implemented. Specifically, the way to reduce the sum by swapping elements or adjusting them was not properly handled.

4. **Correcting the approach**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            # Start with descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_value
            
            # Adjust the permutation to reach K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the maximum we can reduce the current pair
                max_reduce = min(permutation[i] - 1, current_sum - K)
                if max_reduce > 0:
                    # Reduce the current element
                    permutation[i] -= max_reduce
                    current_sum -= max_reduce
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    # Print all results for all test cases
    print("\n".join(map(str, results)))

# Read input and call the function
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_permutation(T, test_cases)
``` 

### Key Changes:
- Corrected the calculation of the maximum possible value of f(P).
- Adjusted the logic for modifying the permutation to reach the desired K.
- Ensured that the output format matches the expected results.

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input Handling**: The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- **Maximum Calculation**: It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a descending permutation.
- **Permutation Construction**: It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired K by reducing elements appropriately.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This implementation should now correctly handle the test cases and produce the expected results.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N(N-1)/2\), which is the sum of the first \(N-1\) integers.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   The previous implementation incorrectly handled the adjustment of the permutation to reach the desired K. Specifically, it did not account for how to effectively reduce the sum of adjacent maximums while maintaining a valid permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   The approach to adjust the permutation was flawed. The logic for reducing the current element and calculating the maximum reduction was not correctly implemented. The goal is to ensure that the permutation remains valid while achieving the desired sum K.

4. **Correcting the Logic**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

### Revised Approach:
1. Start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
2. Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P).
3. If K is greater than this maximum, return -1.
4. If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach K by swapping elements.

Here‚Äôs the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            # Start with descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_value
            
            # Adjust the permutation to reach K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the maximum we can reduce the current pair
                max_reduce = current_sum - K
                if max_reduce > 0:
                    # We can reduce the current pair by at most the difference
                    # between the current element and the next one
                    if permutation[i] > 1:
                        # Reduce the current element
                        reduce_amount = min(max_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)
                        permutation[i] -= reduce_amount
                        current_sum -= reduce_amount
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    # Print all results for all test cases
    print("\n".join(map(str, results)))

# Read input and call the function

T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_permutation(T, test_cases)

### Key Changes:
- The logic for adjusting the permutation has been revised to ensure that we correctly reduce the sum to reach K while maintaining a valid permutation.
- The output format matches the expected results.

This implementation should now correctly handle the test cases and produce the expected results.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given integer K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. If K is greater than this maximum, we return -1. If K is less than or equal to this maximum, we can construct a permutation that achieves K by adjusting the order of the numbers. Specifically, we can start with the descending order and make small adjustments to reduce the sum to K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```

## Instructions

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. This means that the maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N + (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 2 = N(N-1)/2\).

2. **Identifying the maximum value**:
   The maximum value of f(P) is actually \(N(N-1)/2\), not \((N * (N + 1)) // 2 - N\) as previously stated. This means that if K is greater than this maximum value, we should return -1.

3. **Constructing the permutation**:
   The approach to construct the permutation to achieve a specific K was flawed. The logic for adjusting the permutation to reach K was not correctly implemented. Specifically, the way to reduce the sum by swapping elements or adjusting them was not properly handled.

4. **Correcting the approach**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input Handling**: The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- **Maximum Calculation**: It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a descending permutation.
- **Permutation Construction**: It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired K by reducing elements appropriately.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This implementation should now correctly handle the test cases and produce the expected results.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N(N-1)/2\), which is the sum of the first \(N-1\) integers.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   The previous implementation incorrectly handled the adjustment of the permutation to reach the desired K. Specifically, it did not account for how to effectively reduce the sum of adjacent maximums while maintaining a valid permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   The approach to adjust the permutation was flawed. The logic for reducing the current element and calculating the maximum reduction was not correctly implemented. The goal is to ensure that the permutation remains valid while achieving the desired sum K.

4. **Correcting the Logic**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

### Revised Approach:
1. Start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
2. Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P).
3. If K is greater than this maximum, return -1.
4. If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach K by swapping elements.

Here‚Äôs the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            # Start with descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_value
            
            # Adjust the permutation to reach K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the maximum we can reduce the current pair
                max_reduce = current_sum - K
                if max_reduce > 0:
                    # We can reduce the current pair by at most the difference
                    # between the current element and the next one
                    if permutation[i] > 1:
                        # Reduce the current element
                        reduce_amount = min(max_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)
                        permutation[i] -= reduce_amount
                        current_sum -= reduce_amount
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    # Print all results for all test cases
    print("\n".join(map(str, results)))

# Read input and call the function

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_permutation(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- The logic for adjusting the permutation has been revised to ensure that we correctly reduce the sum to reach K while maintaining a valid permutation.
- The output format matches the expected results.

This implementation should now correctly handle the test cases and produce the expected results.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to compute the maximum strength of an army formed from a list of distinct Pok√©mon strengths using an alternating sum. The alternating sum is defined as \( a[b_1] - a[b_2] + a[b_3] - a[b_4] + \ldots \). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the strengths provided.

    Initially, I attempted to sort the strengths in descending order and calculate the alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, this approach did not yield the correct results, as it failed to account for the optimal selection of strengths that would maximize the alternating sum.

    The key insight was that the maximum strength can be achieved by carefully selecting the largest strengths for positive contributions and the next largest for negative contributions. The correct approach involves sorting the strengths and then calculating the alternating sum based on their sorted order.

    Despite multiple attempts to fix the code, the output consistently failed to match the expected results. The final code structure was as follows:

    ```python
    def max_strength(test_cases):
        results = []
        for _ in range(test_cases):
            n, q = map(int, input().split())
            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
        
            max_strength = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    max_strength += strengths[i]
                else:
                    max_strength -= strengths[i]
        
            results.append(max_strength)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    t = int(input())
    max_strength(t)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and ensuring that the logic aligns with the goal of maximizing the alternating sum. The errors encountered were primarily due to miscalculating the contributions of strengths based on their order.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here‚Äôs the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The approach involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the current arrangement, as the books not in this subsequence would need to be moved.

    The solution utilized a dynamic programming technique to compute the LIS. The key steps included initializing an array to track the lengths of increasing subsequences and iterating through the books to update these lengths based on comparisons. The final result was derived by subtracting the length of the LIS from the total number of books.

    The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test case. The main takeaway is the effectiveness of the LIS approach in minimizing moves for sorting problems, which can be applied to similar scenarios involving permutations and orderings. 

    Here‚Äôs the core code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
        lis = [1] * N
        for i in range(1, N):
            for j in range(i):
                if books[i] > books[j]:
                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)
        longest_increasing_length = max(lis)
        return N - longest_increasing_length

    N = int(input())
    books = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))
    ``` 

    This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given integer K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. If K is greater than this maximum, we return -1. If K is less than or equal to this maximum, we can construct a permutation that achieves K by adjusting the order of the numbers. Specifically, we can start with the descending order and make small adjustments to reduce the sum to K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N, K = test_case
           max_value = (N * (N + 1)) // 2 - N  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
           
           if K > max_value:
               print -1
           else:

                       if current_sum - max_reduce >= K:
                           current_sum -= max_reduce
                           # Swap to adjust the permutation
                           permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                       else:
                           # Reduce to exactly K
                           needed_reduce = current_sum - K

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. This means that the maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N + (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 2 = N(N-1)/2\).

2. **Identifying the maximum value**:
   The maximum value of f(P) is actually \(N(N-1)/2\), not \((N * (N + 1)) // 2 - N\) as previously stated. This means that if K is greater than this maximum value, we should return -1.

3. **Constructing the permutation**:
   The approach to construct the permutation to achieve a specific K was flawed. The logic for adjusting the permutation to reach K was not correctly implemented. Specifically, the way to reduce the sum by swapping elements or adjusting them was not properly handled.

4. **Correcting the approach**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            # Start with descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_value
            
            # Adjust the permutation to reach K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the maximum we can reduce the current pair
                max_reduce = min(permutation[i] - 1, current_sum - K)
                if max_reduce > 0:
                    # Reduce the current element
                    permutation[i] -= max_reduce
                    current_sum -= max_reduce
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    # Print all results for all test cases
    print("\n".join(map(str, results)))

# Read input and call the function
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_permutation(T, test_cases)
``` 

### Key Changes:
- Corrected the calculation of the maximum possible value of f(P).
- Adjusted the logic for modifying the permutation to reach the desired K.
- Ensured that the output format matches the expected results. 

This should now correctly handle the test cases provided.

   The previous implementation incorrectly handled the adjustment of the permutation to reach the desired \( K \). Specifically, it did not account for how to effectively reduce the sum of adjacent maximums while maintaining a valid permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   The approach to adjust the permutation was flawed. The logic for reducing the current element and calculating the maximum reduction was not correctly implemented. The goal is to ensure that the permutation remains valid while achieving the desired sum \( K \).

4. **Correcting the Logic**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from \( N \) to \( 1 \).
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible \( f(P) \) and check if \( K \) is achievable.
   - If \( K \) is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly \( K \).

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum \( K \).

### Revised Approach:
1. Start with the descending order of numbers from \( N \) to \( 1 \).
2. Calculate the maximum possible value of \( f(P) \).
3. If \( K \) is greater than this maximum, return -1.
4. If \( K \) is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach \( K \) by swapping elements.

### Key Observations:
- The maximum value of \( f(P) \) can be achieved with the permutation in descending order.
- To achieve a specific \( K \), we can swap elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum.

### Corrected Code:
Here‚Äôs the corrected Python code that implements the above logic:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            # Start with descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_value
            
            # Adjust the permutation to reach K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate how much we need to reduce the current sum
                needed_reduce = current_sum - K
                # The maximum we can reduce the current pair
                max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)
                if max_reduce > 0:
                    # Reduce the current element
                    permutation[i] -= max_reduce
                    current_sum -= max_reduce
            
            # If we still need to adjust, we can swap elements
            if current_sum > K:
                for i in range(N - 1):
                    if current_sum == K:
                        break
                    # Swap elements to reduce the sum
                    if permutation[i] > permutation[i + 1]:
                        # Calculate the difference we can reduce
                        diff = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
                        if current_sum - diff >= K:
                            # Perform the swap
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_sum -= diff
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    # Print all results for all test cases
    print("\n".join(map(str, results)))

# Read input and call the function
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().splitlines()

T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_permutation(T, test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input Handling**: The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- **Maximum Calculation**: It calculates the maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation.
- **Permutation Construction**: It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired \( K \) by reducing elements appropriately.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This implementation should now correctly handle the test cases and produce the expected results.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given integer K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. If K is greater than this maximum, we return -1. If K is less than or equal to this maximum, we can construct a permutation that achieves K by adjusting the order of the numbers. Specifically, we can start with the descending order and make small adjustments to reduce the sum to K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```

       for each test_case in test_cases:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. This means that the maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N + (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 2 = N(N-1)/2\).

2. **Identifying the maximum value**:
   The maximum value of f(P) is actually \(N(N-1)/2\), not \((N * (N + 1)) // 2 - N\) as previously stated. This means that if K is greater than this maximum value, we should return -1.

3. **Constructing the permutation**:
   The approach to construct the permutation to achieve a specific K was flawed. The logic for adjusting the permutation to reach K was not correctly implemented. Specifically, the way to reduce the sum by swapping elements or adjusting them was not properly handled.

4. **Correcting the approach**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            # Start with descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_value
            
            # Adjust the permutation to reach K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the maximum we can reduce the current pair
                max_reduce = min(permutation[i] - 1, current_sum - K)
                if max_reduce > 0:
                    # Reduce the current element
                    permutation[i] -= max_reduce
                    current_sum -= max_reduce
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    # Print all results for all test cases
    print("\n".join(map(str, results)))

# Read input and call the function

T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_permutation(T, test_cases)
``` 

### Key Changes:
- Corrected the calculation of the maximum possible value of f(P).
- Adjusted the logic for modifying the permutation to reach the desired K.
- Ensured that the output format matches the expected results. 

This should now correctly handle the test cases provided.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous attempts and the understanding of the problem, I will now provide a corrected solution for the permutation problem. The key points to address are:

1. **Correct Calculation of Maximum f(P)**: The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N(N-1)/2\).
2. **Constructing the Permutation**: We need to start with the descending order and adjust it to reach the desired K by carefully modifying the permutation.

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input Handling**: The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- **Maximum Calculation**: It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a descending permutation.
- **Permutation Construction**: It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired K by reducing elements appropriately.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This implementation should now correctly handle the test cases and produce the expected results.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N(N-1)/2\), which is the sum of the first \(N-1\) integers.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   The previous implementation incorrectly handled the adjustment of the permutation to reach the desired K. Specifically, it did not account for how to effectively reduce the sum of adjacent maximums while maintaining a valid permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   The approach to adjust the permutation was flawed. The logic for reducing the current element and calculating the maximum reduction was not correctly implemented. The goal is to ensure that the permutation remains valid while achieving the desired sum K.

4. **Correcting the Logic**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

### Revised Approach:
1. Start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
2. Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P).
3. If K is greater than this maximum, return -1.
4. If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach K by swapping elements.

Here‚Äôs the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            # Start with descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_value
            
            # Adjust the permutation to reach K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the maximum we can reduce the current pair
                max_reduce = current_sum - K
                if max_reduce > 0:
                    # We can reduce the current pair by at most the difference
                    # between the current element and the next one
                    if permutation[i] > 1:
                        # Reduce the current element
                        reduce_amount = min(max_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)
                        permutation[i] -= reduce_amount
                        current_sum -= reduce_amount
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    # Print all results for all test cases

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to compute the maximum strength of an army formed from a list of distinct Pok√©mon strengths using an alternating sum. The alternating sum is defined as \( a[b_1] - a[b_2] + a[b_3] - a[b_4] + \ldots \). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the strengths provided.

    Initially, I attempted to sort the strengths in descending order and calculate the alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, this approach did not yield the correct results, as it failed to account for the optimal selection of strengths that would maximize the alternating sum.

    The key insight was that the maximum strength can be achieved by carefully selecting the largest strengths for positive contributions and the next largest for negative contributions. The correct approach involves sorting the strengths and then calculating the alternating sum based on their sorted order.

    Despite multiple attempts to fix the code, the output consistently failed to match the expected results. The final code structure was as follows:

    ```python
    def max_strength(test_cases):
        results = []
        for _ in range(test_cases):
            n, q = map(int, input().split())
            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
        
            max_strength = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    max_strength += strengths[i]
                else:
                    max_strength -= strengths[i]
        
            results.append(max_strength)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    t = int(input())
    max_strength(t)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and ensuring that the logic aligns with the goal of maximizing the alternating sum. The errors encountered were primarily due to miscalculating the contributions of strengths based on their order.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The approach involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the current arrangement, as the books not in this subsequence would need to be moved.

    The solution utilized a dynamic programming technique to compute the LIS. The key steps included initializing an array to track the lengths of increasing subsequences and iterating through the books to update these lengths based on comparisons. The final result was derived by subtracting the length of the LIS from the total number of books.

    The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test case. The main takeaway is the effectiveness of the LIS approach in minimizing moves for sorting problems, which can be applied to similar scenarios involving permutations and orderings. 

    Here‚Äôs the core code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
        lis = [1] * N
        for i in range(1, N):
            for j in range(i):
                if books[i] > books[j]:
                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)
        longest_increasing_length = max(lis)
        return N - longest_increasing_length

    N = int(input())
    books = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))
    ``` 

    This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here‚Äôs the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input Handling**: The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- **Maximum Calculation**: It calculates the maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation.
- **Permutation Construction**: It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired \( K \) by reducing elements appropriately.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This implementation should now correctly handle the test cases and produce the expected results.

 Given the previous attempts and the insights gained, I will now provide a revised solution to the permutation problem. The goal is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the function \( f(P) \) equals a given integer \( K \).

### Key Points to Address:
1. **Maximum Value of f(P)**: The maximum value of \( f(P) \) for a permutation of size \( N \) is \( N(N-1)/2 \).
2. **Constructing the Permutation**: We need to start with the descending order and adjust it to reach the desired \( K \) by carefully modifying the permutation.
3. **Valid Permutation**: Ensure that the permutation remains valid while achieving the desired sum \( K \).

### Revised Approach:
1. Start with the descending order of numbers from \( N \) to \( 1 \).
2. Calculate the maximum possible value of \( f(P) \).
3. If \( K \) is greater than this maximum, return -1.
4. If \( K \) is less than or equal to the maximum, adjust the permutation to reach \( K \).

### Corrected Code:

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given integer K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. If K is greater than this maximum, we return -1. If K is less than or equal to this maximum, we can construct a permutation that achieves K by adjusting the order of the numbers. Specifically, we can start with the descending order and make small adjustments to reduce the sum to K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. This means that the maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N + (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 2 = N(N-1)/2\).

2. **Identifying the maximum value**:
   The maximum value of f(P) is actually \(N(N-1)/2\), not \((N * (N + 1)) // 2 - N\) as previously stated. This means that if K is greater than this maximum value, we should return -1.

3. **Constructing the permutation**:
   The approach to construct the permutation to achieve a specific K was flawed. The logic for adjusting the permutation to reach K was not correctly implemented. Specifically, the way to reduce the sum by swapping elements or adjusting them was not properly handled.

4. **Correcting the approach**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous attempts and the understanding of the problem, I will now provide a corrected solution for the permutation problem. The key points to address are:

1. **Correct Calculation of Maximum f(P)**: The maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N(N-1)/2\).
2. **Constructing the Permutation**: We need to start with the descending order and adjust it to reach the desired K by carefully modifying the permutation.

Here‚Äôs the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Maximum Calculation**: It calculates the maximum possible value of f(P) for a descending permutation.
- **Permutation Construction**: It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired K by reducing elements appropriately.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This implementation should now correctly handle the test cases and produce the expected results.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is indeed \(N(N-1)/2\), which is the sum of the first \(N-1\) integers.

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   The previous implementation incorrectly handled the adjustment of the permutation to reach the desired K. Specifically, it did not account for how to effectively reduce the sum of adjacent maximums while maintaining a valid permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   The approach to adjust the permutation was flawed. The logic for reducing the current element and calculating the maximum reduction was not correctly implemented. The goal is to ensure that the permutation remains valid while achieving the desired sum K.

4. **Correcting the Logic**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

### Revised Approach:
1. Start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
2. Calculate the maximum possible value of f(P).
3. If K is greater than this maximum, return -1.
4. If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach K by swapping elements.

Here‚Äôs the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            # Start with descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_value

                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the maximum we can reduce the current pair
                max_reduce = current_sum - K
                if max_reduce > 0:
                    # We can reduce the current pair by at most the difference
                    # between the current element and the next one
                    if permutation[i] > 1:
                        # Reduce the current element
                        reduce_amount = min(max_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)
                        permutation[i] -= reduce_amount
                        current_sum -= reduce_amount

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] ### Summary of Attempts for Permutation Problem

The task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the function \( f(P) \) equals a given integer \( K \). The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a permutation of size \( N \) is \( N(N-1)/2 \).

#### Key Insights:
1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \( f(P) \) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \( K \) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.
2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \( f(P) \)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \( K \) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.

#### Issues Encountered:
- The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \( K \). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.
- The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.

#### Strategies That Did Not Work:
- The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.
- The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.

#### Final Code Snippet:
The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \( K \). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            # Start with descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_value
            
            # Adjust the permutation to reach K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                needed_reduce = current_sum - K
                max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)
                if max_reduce > 0:
                    permutation[i] -= max_reduce
                    current_sum -= max_reduce
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
    print("\n".join(map(str, results)))
```

### Conclusion:
This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
For a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN) of numbers [1, 2, ..., N], we define the function f(P) = max(p1, p2) + max(p2, p3) + ... + max(pN-1, pN).
You are given N and an integer K. Find and report a permutation P of [1, 2, ..., N] such that f(P) = K, if such a permutation exists.
Note f([1]) = 0.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
- The only line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers N, K respectively.

-----Output-----
For each test case, if a permutation satisfying the condition exists, output a single line containing N space-separated integers which denotes any such permutation. If no such permutation exists, output a single integer -1 instead.
Use fast I/O methods since the size of the output is large.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 ‚â§ T ‚â§ 40
- 1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 105
- Sum of N over all test cases in each file ‚â§ 106
- 0 ‚â§ K ‚â§ 2 * 1010

-----Example-----
Input:
3
4 12
2 2
5 14

Output:
-1
1 2
5 4 3 2 1

-----Explanation-----
Example 1. There doesn't exist any permutation of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4] that can have its f value equal to 4. Hence answer is -1.
Example 2. The permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] both have their f values equal to 2. You can print any of these two permutations. 
Example 3. The permutation [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
has f value = max(5, 4) + max(4, 3) + max(3, 2) + max(2, 1) = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that a specific function, which sums the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation, equals a given integer K. If no such permutation exists, we should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how the function f(P) is calculated. The maximum possible value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is achieved when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. If K is greater than this maximum, we return -1. If K is less than or equal to this maximum, we can construct a permutation that achieves K by adjusting the order of the numbers. Specifically, we can start with the descending order and make small adjustments to reduce the sum to K.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_permutation(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify the issues in the previous solution.

1. **Understanding the function f(P)**:
   The function f(P) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of f(P) occurs when the permutation is in descending order, which gives us the sum of the first N-1 integers. This means that the maximum value of f(P) for a permutation of size N is \(N + (N-1) + (N-2) + ... + 2 = N(N-1)/2\).

2. **Identifying the maximum value**:
   The maximum value of f(P) is actually \(N(N-1)/2\), not \((N * (N + 1)) // 2 - N\) as previously stated. This means that if K is greater than this maximum value, we should return -1.

3. **Constructing the permutation**:
   The approach to construct the permutation to achieve a specific K was flawed. The logic for adjusting the permutation to reach K was not correctly implemented. Specifically, the way to reduce the sum by swapping elements or adjusting them was not properly handled.

4. **Correcting the approach**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from N to 1.
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible f(P) and check if K is achievable.
   - If K is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly K.

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum K.

Now, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K = case
        max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
        if K > max_value:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            # Start with descending order
            permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
            current_sum = max_value
            
            # Adjust the permutation to reach K
            for i in range(N - 1):
                if current_sum == K:
                    break
                # Calculate the maximum we can reduce the current pair
                max_reduce = min(permutation[i] - 1, current_sum - K)
                if max_reduce > 0:
                    # Reduce the current element
                    permutation[i] -= max_reduce
                    current_sum -= max_reduce
            
            results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))

T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, line.split())) for line in data[1:T + 1]]

find_permutation(T, test_cases)
```

- Corrected the calculation of the maximum possible value of f(P).

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Input Handling**: The code reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- **Maximum Calculation**: It calculates the maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a descending permutation.
- **Permutation Construction**: It starts with a descending permutation and adjusts it to reach the desired \( K \) by reducing elements appropriately.
- **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This implementation should now correctly handle the test cases and produce the expected results.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues in the previous solution step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**:
   The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a permutation of size \( N \) is indeed \( N(N-1)/2 \). 

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   The previous implementation incorrectly handled the adjustment of the permutation to reach the desired \( K \). Specifically, it did not account for how to effectively reduce the sum of adjacent maximums while maintaining a valid permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   The approach to adjust the permutation was flawed. The logic for reducing the current element and calculating the maximum reduction was not correctly implemented. The goal is to ensure that the permutation remains valid while achieving the desired sum \( K \).

4. **Correcting the Logic**:
   - We need to start with the descending order of numbers from \( N \) to \( 1 \).
   - We need to calculate the maximum possible \( f(P) \) and check if \( K \) is achievable.
   - If \( K \) is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach exactly \( K \).

5. **Implementation**:
   We can adjust the permutation by swapping elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum. The goal is to find a valid permutation that achieves the desired sum \( K \).

### Revised Approach:
1. Start with the descending order of numbers from \( N \) to \( 1 \).
2. Calculate the maximum possible value of \( f(P) \).
3. If \( K \) is greater than this maximum, return -1.
4. If \( K \) is less than or equal to the maximum, we need to find a way to adjust the permutation to reach \( K \) by swapping elements.

### Key Observations:
- The maximum value of \( f(P) \) can be achieved with the permutation in descending order.
- To achieve a specific \( K \), we can swap elements in a way that reduces the contribution of certain pairs to the sum.

### Corrected Code:
Here‚Äôs the corrected Python code that implements the above logic:

```python
def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
    results = []

                        # Calculate the difference we can reduce
                        diff = permutation[i] - permutation[i + 1]
                        if current_sum - diff >= K:
                            # Perform the swap
                            permutation[i], permutation[i + 1] = permutation[i + 1], permutation[i]
                            current_sum -= diff

### Revised Approach:

2. Calculate the maximum possible value of \( f(P) \).

INFO - [Task id] 1249 [generation text] In my attempts to solve the permutation problem, I learned several key insights about the approach and logic required to derive a valid permutation that meets the specified conditions. 

### Key Insights:
1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a permutation of size \( N \) is \( N(N-1)/2 \). This understanding is crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a specific \( K \).

2. **Feasibility Conditions**: The official solution checks specific conditions to determine if \( K \) is achievable:
   - For even \( N \), \( K \) must be within the bounds of \( (N(N+1)/2 - 1) \) and \( 3((N/2)^2) - 1 \).
   - For odd \( N \), similar bounds apply, but with adjustments for the odd case.

3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution constructs the permutation by:
   - Starting with a descending order.
   - Adjusting elements based on the difference between the desired \( K \) and the maximum possible sum.
   - Using a systematic approach to fill in the permutation while ensuring that the conditions for \( K \) are met.

4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution employs an iterative method to adjust the permutation based on the remaining value of \( K \) after accounting for the maximum possible sum. This involves incrementally modifying the permutation to reach the desired sum.

### Code Snippet from Official Solution:
The official solution uses a structured approach to handle both even and odd cases, ensuring that the permutation is constructed correctly based on the conditions derived from \( K \).

```python
if(n%2==0):
    if(k<(n*(n+1))//2 - 1  or  k>3*((n//2)**2) - 1): print(-1)
    # Additional logic for constructing the permutation
else:
    if(n==1): print(1) if(k==0) else print(-1)
    # Additional logic for constructing the permutation
```

### Conclusion:
The official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. My previous attempts failed primarily due to not fully accounting for the bounds of \( K \) and the systematic construction of the permutation. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and the need for a structured approach to constructing solutions in combinatorial problems.
