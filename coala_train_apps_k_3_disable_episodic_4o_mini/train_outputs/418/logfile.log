INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce a positive integer `n` to 1. The operations allowed are:
   - If `n` is even, you can divide it by 2.
   - If `n` is odd, you can either add 1 or subtract 1 from it.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach or an iterative approach. The idea is to keep reducing `n` using the allowed operations until we reach 1. If `n` is even, we simply divide it by 2. If `n` is odd, we have two choices: either add 1 or subtract 1. We will choose the operation that leads to the least number of steps to reach 1. We can use a loop or recursion to keep track of the number of operations performed.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function integerReplacement(n):
       if n is 1:
           return 0
       if n is even:
           return 1 + integerReplacement(n / 2)
       else:
           # For odd n, we can either add 1 or subtract 1
           return 1 + min(integerReplacement(n + 1), integerReplacement(n - 1))
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python

    def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Base case: if n is 1, no operations are needed
        if n == 1:

        # If n is even, we can divide it by 2
        if n % 2 == 0:
            return 1 + self.integerReplacement(n // 2)
        else:
            # If n is odd, we can either add 1 or subtract 1
            return 1 + min(self.integerReplacement(n + 1), self.integerReplacement(n - 1))

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

    Title: Josephus Problem
    Part: 1/1
    # Josephus Problem

    ## Statement

    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.
    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. 
    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.
    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.
    The process stops when one number remains.
    It is required to find the last number.

    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).

    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.
    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \log n)$.
    We want something better though.

    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution

    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.

    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:

    $$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
    n\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\
    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\
    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\
    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\
    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\
    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\
    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\
    \end{array}$$

    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:

    $$J_{n,k} = \left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \bmod n \right) + 1$$

    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$

    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:

    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \bmod n$$

    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.

    ## Implementation

    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;
    }
    ```

    **Non-recursive form** :

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
      	  res = (res + k) % i;
        return res + 1;
    }
    ```

    This formula can also be found analytically.
    Again here we assume 0-indexing.
    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.
    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \bmod n$.
    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \ \bmod n$.

    ## Modeling a $O(k \log n)$ solution

    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.
    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$) in one run without looping over.
    Afterwards we have $n - \lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k)$-th number.
    So we have to shift by that many.
    We can notice that $\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k$ is simply $-n \bmod k$.
    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.
    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.

    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.

    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;
        if (k == 1)
            return n-1;
        if (k > n)
            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;
        int cnt = n / k;
        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);
        res -= n % k;
        if (res < 0)
            res += n;
        else
            res += res / (k - 1);
        return res;
    }
    ```

    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:

    $$ n \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) ^ x = 1, $$

    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:

    $$\ln n + x \ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) = 0,$$ 
    $$x = - \frac{\ln n}{\ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)},$$

    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:

    $$x \approx k \ln n$$

    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \log n)$.

    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$

    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.

    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):

    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$

    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:

    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$

    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, "restarting" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:

    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \left(n-2^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor} \right)$$

    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$

    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler "The Josephus Problem" and Odlyzko, Wilf "Functional iteration and the Josephus problem").

[Reflection]:
    In my attempts to solve the permutation problem, I learned several key insights about the approach and logic required to derive a valid permutation that meets the specified conditions. 

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a permutation of size \( N \) is \( N(N-1)/2 \). This understanding is crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a specific \( K \).

    2. **Feasibility Conditions**: The official solution checks specific conditions to determine if \( K \) is achievable:
       - For even \( N \), \( K \) must be within the bounds of \( (N(N+1)/2 - 1) \) and \( 3((N/2)^2) - 1 \).
       - For odd \( N \), similar bounds apply, but with adjustments for the odd case.

    3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution constructs the permutation by:
       - Starting with a descending order.
       - Adjusting elements based on the difference between the desired \( K \) and the maximum possible sum.
       - Using a systematic approach to fill in the permutation while ensuring that the conditions for \( K \) are met.

    4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution employs an iterative method to adjust the permutation based on the remaining value of \( K \) after accounting for the maximum possible sum. This involves incrementally modifying the permutation to reach the desired sum.

    ### Code Snippet from Official Solution:
    The official solution uses a structured approach to handle both even and odd cases, ensuring that the permutation is constructed correctly based on the conditions derived from \( K \).

    ```python
    if(n%2==0):
        if(k<(n*(n+1))//2 - 1  or  k>3*((n//2)**2) - 1): print(-1)
        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation
    else:
        if(n==1): print(1) if(k==0) else print(-1)
        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    The official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. My previous attempts failed primarily due to not fully accounting for the bounds of \( K \) and the systematic construction of the permutation. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and the need for a structured approach to constructing solutions in combinatorial problems.

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce a positive integer `n` to `1`. The operations allowed are:
   - If `n` is even, you can divide it by `2`.
   - If `n` is odd, you can either add `1` or subtract `1` from it.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. If `n` is even, we simply divide it by `2` and count that as one operation. If `n` is odd, we have two choices: either add `1` or subtract `1`. We will recursively calculate the number of operations needed for both choices and take the minimum of the two. This will continue until we reach `1`, at which point no more operations are needed.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function integerReplacement(n):
       if n == 1:
           return 0  // No operations needed
       if n is even:
           return 1 + integerReplacement(n / 2)  // One operation to divide by 2
       else:
           // n is odd, we can either add or subtract
           return 1 + min(integerReplacement(n + 1), integerReplacement(n - 1))  // Choose the minimum operations
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python

        if n % 2 == 0:

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce a positive integer `n` to `1`. The operations allowed are:
   - If `n` is even, you can divide it by `2`.
   - If `n` is odd, you can either add `1` or subtract `1` from it.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. If `n` is even, we simply divide it by `2` and count that as one operation. If `n` is odd, we have two choices: either add `1` or subtract `1`. We will recursively calculate the number of operations needed for both choices and take the minimum of the two. This will continue until we reach `1`, at which point no more operations are needed.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function integerReplacement(n):
       if n == 1:
           return 0  // No operations needed
       if n is even:
           return 1 + integerReplacement(n / 2)  // One operation to divide by 2

           // n is odd, we can either add or subtract

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] The problem involves reducing a positive integer `n` to `1` using a minimum number of operations, where the operations depend on whether `n` is even or odd. The core concepts tested here include recursion and decision-making based on the parity of the number. 

The solution was implemented using a recursive approach, where the function checks if `n` is even or odd. If even, it divides `n` by `2` and counts that as one operation. If odd, it explores both options (adding or subtracting `1`) and takes the minimum of the two results. This approach effectively captures the necessary operations to reach `1`.

The final implementation was straightforward and passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the recursive strategy is effective for this problem. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution was efficient for the given constraints. The recursive nature of the solution allows for clear logic flow, although it could be optimized further using memoization to avoid redundant calculations in larger inputs. 

Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

INFO - [Task id] 418 [generation text] The official solution provides a more efficient approach to solving the problem of reducing a positive integer `n` to `1` through a series of operations. While my initial recursive solution was conceptually sound, it could lead to excessive function calls and potential stack overflow for larger values of `n`. The official solution, on the other hand, employs an iterative approach, which is generally more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.

Key insights from the official solution include:

1. **Iterative Approach**: Instead of using recursion, the official solution uses a `while` loop to continuously modify `n` until it reaches `1`. This avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and stack management.

2. **Handling Odd Numbers**: The official solution optimizes the handling of odd numbers by checking specific conditions:
   - If `n % 4 == 1` or `n == 3`, it decrements `n` by `1`. This is because reducing `n` in these cases leads to a quicker path to an even number, which can then be halved.
   - For other odd numbers, it increments `n` by `1`, which also leads to an even number.

3. **Counting Operations**: The solution maintains a counter (`ans`) to track the number of operations performed, which is incremented in each iteration.

Overall, the official solution is more efficient and avoids the pitfalls of recursion, making it a better choice for larger inputs. This experience highlights the importance of considering both iterative and recursive approaches when solving problems, especially in terms of performance and resource management.
