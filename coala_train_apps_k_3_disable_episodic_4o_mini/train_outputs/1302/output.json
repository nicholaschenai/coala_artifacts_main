    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The Chef has a number of boxes, each containing a number of tiles equal to its index (1 tile in the first box, 2 tiles in the second box, and so on up to N tiles in the N-th box). He has two houses, each with N rooms, and each room has a floor area that is a perfect square (1x1 for room 1, 2x2 for room 2, etc.). The goal is to determine how many rooms in both houses can be completely tiled using the tiles from the boxes, with the condition that tiles from a single box must be used to tile two rooms (one in each house) completely.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   For each box containing `i` tiles, we can only tile two rooms completely if `i` is even and equal to the sum of the areas of the two rooms. The area of room `j` is `j*j`. Therefore, we need to find pairs of rooms `(j1, j2)` such that `j1*j1 + j2*j2 = i`. We can iterate through all possible room pairs and check if the total area matches the number of tiles in the box. We will count how many rooms can be tiled completely across all boxes.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_tiled_rooms(N):\n       total_rooms = 0\n       for i from 1 to N:\n           if i is even:\n               for j1 from 1 to N:\n                   for j2 from 1 to N:\n                       if j1 != j2 and j1*j1 + j2*j2 == i:\n                           total_rooms += 2  // Count both rooms\n                           break  // Move to the next box\n       return total_rooms\n\n   function solve():\n       read T\n       for each testcase:\n           read N\n           result = count_tiled_rooms(N)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_tiled_rooms(N):\n    total_rooms = 0\n    # Iterate through each box from 1 to N\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        # Only consider even boxes\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # Check pairs of rooms\n            for j1 in range(1, N + 1):\n                for j2 in range(1, N + 1):\n                    if j1 != j2 and j1 * j1 + j2 * j2 == i:\n                        total_rooms += 2  # Count both rooms\n                        break  # Move to the next box\n    return total_rooms\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n        result = count_tiled_rooms(N)  # Calculate the total tiled rooms\n        results.append(result)  # Store the result\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)  # Print all results\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the code\nsolve()\n```",
