    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**:\n   We need to determine if we can modify a sequence of integers such that the sum of all its elements becomes zero. The modification allowed is to decrease any element \\( A[i] \\) by its index \\( i \\) (1-based). We can perform this operation any number of times, including not performing it at all.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:\n   To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total sum of the sequence. If the sum is already zero, we can immediately return \"YES\". If the sum is positive, we need to check if we can reduce it to zero by using the allowed operations. The maximum we can reduce the sum by is the sum of the indices (1 to N), which is \\( N(N + 1)/2 \\). If the sum of the sequence is less than or equal to this maximum reduction, we can achieve a sum of zero; otherwise, it's impossible.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N\n           read array A\n           calculate total_sum = sum(A)\n           calculate max_reduction = N * (N + 1) / 2\n           if total_sum <= max_reduction:\n               print \"YES\"\n           else:\n               print \"NO\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case[0]\n        A = case[1]\n        \n        total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array\n        max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible\n        \n        if total_sum <= max_reduction:\n            print(\"YES\")  # It's possible to make the sequence good\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")  # It's impossible to make the sequence good\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    test_cases.append((N, A))\n\ncan_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)\n```",
