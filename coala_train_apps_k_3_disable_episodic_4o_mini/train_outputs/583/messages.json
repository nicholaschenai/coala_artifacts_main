The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\).\n\n    #### Key Insights:\n    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \\( f(P) \\) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \\( K \\) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.\n    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \\( f(P) \\)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \\( K \\) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.\n\n    #### Issues Encountered:\n    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \\( K \\). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.\n    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.\n\n    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:\n    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.\n    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet:\n    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \\( K \\). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                # Start with descending order\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_sum = max_value\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to reach K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_sum == K:\n                        break\n                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K\n                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)\n                    if max_reduce > 0:\n                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce\n                        current_sum -= max_reduce\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n        print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. The expected output required alternating lines of numbers, where even-indexed lines counted up from `0` to the line index, and odd-indexed lines counted down from the line index to `0`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Pattern Recognition**: The output pattern alternates between counting up and counting down based on the line index. This was a crucial aspect that needed to be correctly implemented to match the expected output.\n    2. **Logic Implementation**: The initial attempts incorrectly generated lines by not adhering to the specified counting logic. The correct approach involved checking if the line index was even or odd and generating the line accordingly.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    The final corrected code that adheres to the requirements is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n        for K in test_cases:\n            for i in range(K):\n                line = \"\"\n                if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index: count up from 0 to i\n                    for j in range(i + 1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                else:  # Odd index: count down from i to 0\n                    for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                print(line)\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]\n    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    ### Lessons Learned:\n    - It is essential to carefully analyze the output requirements and ensure that the logic implemented matches those requirements.\n    - Alternating patterns can often lead to confusion; clear separation of logic for different cases (even vs. odd) is necessary to avoid errors.\n    - Testing with various inputs can help identify edge cases and ensure the robustness of the solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.\n\n    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.\n\n    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q\n            index += 1\n        \n            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills\n            index += 1\n        \n            # Create a prefix sum array\n            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)\n        \n            # Fill the prefix sum array\n            for i in range(1, N + 1):\n                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]\n        \n            # Process each query\n            for __ in range(Q):\n                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query\n                index += 1\n            \n                # Calculate the sum from X to Y\n                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]\n                results.append(result)  # Store the result\n    \n        # Print all results for all queries\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    # Call the solve function to execute the code\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\).\n\n    #### Key Insights:\n    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \\( f(P) \\) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \\( K \\) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.\n    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \\( f(P) \\)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \\( K \\) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.\n\n    #### Issues Encountered:\n    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \\( K \\). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.\n    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.\n\n    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:\n    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.\n    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet:\n    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \\( K \\). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                # Start with descending order\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_sum = max_value\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to reach K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_sum == K:\n                        break\n                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K\n                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)\n                    if max_reduce > 0:\n                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce\n                        current_sum -= max_reduce\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n        print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input \\( K \\) for multiple test cases.

This method is efficient and directly addresses the problem's requirements without unnecessary complexity.\n\nIn contrast, my solution initially conflated the conditions for determining if the sequence could be made good, leading to incorrect outputs in certain test cases. The official solution's clarity in handling edge cases, particularly when \\( N = 1 \\), also highlights the importance of considering special cases explicitly.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more effective in breaking down the problem and ensuring that all scenarios are accounted for, which is a valuable lesson for future problem-solving endeavors."

It calculates the total sum of the sequence and the maximum possible reduction based on the sequence's length. If the total sum is already zero, it outputs \"YES\". If the total sum is positive and can be reduced to zero within the calculated maximum reduction, it also outputs \"YES\". Otherwise, it outputs \"NO\", indicating that making the sequence good is impossible. The results for each test case are printed sequentially.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to determine if a sequence of integers can be manipulated to achieve a specific sum, particularly in competitive programming or algorithm design. It can be applied in problems involving constraints on operations that can be performed on elements of a sequence, such as reducing values based on their indices. Understanding how to calculate the total sum and the maximum possible reduction helps in efficiently solving similar problems with different constraints or operations."
