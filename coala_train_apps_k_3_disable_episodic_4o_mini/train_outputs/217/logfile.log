INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have an array of non-negative integers, and we need to find the number of unique results obtained by taking the bitwise OR of all possible contiguous subarrays. A subarray is any continuous segment of the array. We only count each unique result once, even if it appears multiple times.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array and for each starting index, calculate the bitwise OR for all possible ending indices. We can keep track of the results using a set, which automatically handles duplicates for us. The bitwise OR operation combines bits from the numbers, and as we extend the subarray, the result can only stay the same or increase (it never decreases). Thus, we can efficiently compute the results without recalculating from scratch for overlapping subarrays.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty set to store unique results
   Initialize a variable to keep track of the current OR value
   For each starting index i in the array:
       Set current OR to 0
       For each ending index j from i to the end of the array:
           Update current OR with the bitwise OR of current OR and A[j]
           Add current OR to the set of results
   Return the size of the set as the final answer
   ```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array by jumping according to specific rules, I initially implemented a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The main challenge was ensuring that the jump validity checks were correctly implemented, particularly the requirement that all intermediate values between the starting and destination indices must be less than the value at the starting index.

    Initially, the code failed to account for all valid paths due to incorrect jump validity checks and an inefficient counting mechanism. The use of a visited set was appropriate to prevent revisiting indices, but it led to missed paths when not managed correctly.

    The successful strategy involved implementing memoization to store results for previously computed indices, which significantly improved efficiency and ensured that all valid paths were explored. The final implementation correctly checks both left and right jumps within the allowed distance and verifies that all intermediate values meet the required conditions.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:
            memo = {}
        
            def dfs(index):
                if index in memo:
                    return memo[index]
            
                max_count = 1
            
                for x in range(1, d + 1):
                    if index + x < len(arr) and arr[index] > arr[index + x]:
                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):
                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))
            
                for x in range(1, d + 1):
                    if index - x >= 0 and arr[index] > arr[index - x]:
                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):
                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x))
            
                memo[index] = max_count
                return max_count

            max_jumps = 0
            for index in range(len(arr)):
                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index))
            return max_jumps
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing state in recursive functions and the benefits of memoization in optimizing performance.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to compute the maximum strength of an army formed from a list of distinct Pokémon strengths using an alternating sum. The alternating sum is defined as \( a[b_1] - a[b_2] + a[b_3] - a[b_4] + \ldots \). The challenge was to maximize this sum based on the strengths provided.

    Initially, I attempted to sort the strengths in descending order and calculate the alternating sum by adding strengths at even indices and subtracting those at odd indices. However, this approach did not yield the correct results, as it failed to account for the optimal selection of strengths that would maximize the alternating sum.

    The key insight was that the maximum strength can be achieved by carefully selecting the largest strengths for positive contributions and the next largest for negative contributions. The correct approach involves sorting the strengths and then calculating the alternating sum based on their sorted order.

    Despite multiple attempts to fix the code, the output consistently failed to match the expected results. The final code structure was as follows:

    ```python
    def max_strength(test_cases):
        results = []
        for _ in range(test_cases):
            n, q = map(int, input().split())
            strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
            strengths.sort(reverse=True)
        
            max_strength = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    max_strength += strengths[i]
                else:
                    max_strength -= strengths[i]
        
            results.append(max_strength)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    t = int(input())
    max_strength(t)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and ensuring that the logic aligns with the goal of maximizing the alternating sum. The errors encountered were primarily due to miscalculating the contributions of strengths based on their order.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
We have an array A of non-negative integers.
For every (contiguous) subarray B = [A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[j]] (with i <= j), we take the bitwise OR of all the elements in B, obtaining a result A[i] | A[i+1] | ... | A[j].
Return the number of possible results.  (Results that occur more than once are only counted once in the final answer.)
 

Example 1:
Input: [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
There is only one possible result: 0.


Example 2:
Input: [1,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The possible subarrays are [1], [1], [2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 1, 2].
These yield the results 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3.
There are 3 unique values, so the answer is 3.


Example 3:
Input: [1,2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The possible results are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.




 
Note:

1 <= A.length <= 50000

INFO - [Task id] 217 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to find the number of unique results obtained by taking the bitwise OR of all possible contiguous subarrays from a given array of non-negative integers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible starting points of subarrays. For each starting point, we will compute the bitwise OR for all possible ending points. We will keep track of the results in a set to ensure uniqueness. The bitwise OR operation accumulates values, meaning that once we include a new element in our subarray, the result can only stay the same or increase. Thus, we can efficiently compute the results without recalculating the OR from scratch for overlapping subarrays.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function subarrayBitwiseORs(A):
       create an empty set to store unique results
       create a variable to hold the current OR value
       for each starting index i from 0 to length of A:
           set current OR to 0
           for each ending index j from i to length of A:
               update current OR with A[j] using bitwise OR
               add current OR to the set of results

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] The problem involved calculating the number of unique results from the bitwise OR of all contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The key insight was that the bitwise OR operation accumulates values, meaning that once a new element is included in the subarray, the result can only stay the same or increase. This allowed for an efficient approach to compute results without recalculating the OR from scratch for overlapping subarrays.

The implemented solution involved iterating through each possible starting index of the subarray and then iterating through each possible ending index, updating the current OR value and storing it in a set to ensure uniqueness. This approach effectively captured all unique results.

The final code snippet is as follows:

```python
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: list[int]) -> int:
        unique_results = set()
        for i in range(len(A)):
            current_or = 0
            for j in range(i, len(A)):
                current_or |= A[j]
                unique_results.add(current_or)
        return len(unique_results)
```

The solution passed all test cases, indicating that the approach was effective and efficient for the problem constraints. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        res = set()
        cur = set()
        for a in A:
            cur = {a | i for i in cur}
            cur |= {a}
            res |= cur
        return len(res)

INFO - [Task id] 217 [generation text] The official solution employs a more efficient approach to solve the problem of counting unique bitwise OR results from subarrays. Instead of iterating through all possible subarrays, it uses a set to keep track of the current bitwise OR results as it processes each element in the array. 

### Key Insights from the Official Solution:
1. **Use of Sets**: The solution maintains two sets: `res` for storing all unique results and `cur` for storing the current bitwise OR results derived from the current element being processed.
  
2. **Efficient Update**: For each element `a` in the array, it updates the `cur` set by performing a bitwise OR operation with all existing values in `cur`. This allows it to efficiently compute new results without needing to iterate through all possible subarrays explicitly.

3. **Combining Results**: After updating `cur`, it combines the results into `res`, ensuring that all unique results are captured.

4. **Final Count**: The final result is simply the size of the `res` set, which contains all unique bitwise OR results.

### Comparison to My Approach:
- My initial approach involved nested loops to explicitly calculate the bitwise OR for each subarray, which is less efficient, especially for larger arrays. The official solution's method reduces the time complexity by avoiding redundant calculations and leveraging the properties of the bitwise OR operation.
- The official solution is more concise and elegant, demonstrating a better understanding of set operations and the nature of the problem.

Overall, the official solution highlights the importance of optimizing algorithms by reducing unnecessary computations and utilizing data structures effectively. This experience reinforces the value of exploring different approaches to problem-solving in programming.
