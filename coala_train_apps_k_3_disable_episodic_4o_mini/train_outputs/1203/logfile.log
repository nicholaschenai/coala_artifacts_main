## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the number of subsets of the first N natural numbers (1 to N) where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of that subset. We will handle multiple test cases and queries efficiently, as the constraints are quite large.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, we will read the values of N and Q.
   - For each query, we need to determine how many subsets exist where the number I is at position K.
   - To do this, we can break down the problem:
     - If I is at position K, then there must be K-1 numbers less than I in the subset.
     - The remaining numbers in the subset can be any of the numbers greater than I.
   - We can use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to choose the required numbers:
     - The number of ways to choose K-1 numbers from the first I-1 numbers (those less than I).
     - The number of ways to choose any number of elements from the remaining numbers (those greater than I).
   - We will precompute factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate combinations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
       create an array factorial of size max_n + 1
       create an array inverse_factorial of size max_n + 1

           for each query:

               if K > I or K < 1:

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    In my attempts to solve the permutation problem, I learned several key insights about the approach and logic required to derive a valid permutation that meets the specified conditions. 

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a permutation of size \( N \) is \( N(N-1)/2 \). This understanding is crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a specific \( K \).

    2. **Feasibility Conditions**: The official solution checks specific conditions to determine if \( K \) is achievable:
       - For even \( N \), \( K \) must be within the bounds of \( (N(N+1)/2 - 1) \) and \( 3((N/2)^2) - 1 \).
       - For odd \( N \), similar bounds apply, but with adjustments for the odd case.

    3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution constructs the permutation by:
       - Starting with a descending order.
       - Adjusting elements based on the difference between the desired \( K \) and the maximum possible sum.
       - Using a systematic approach to fill in the permutation while ensuring that the conditions for \( K \) are met.

    4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution employs an iterative method to adjust the permutation based on the remaining value of \( K \) after accounting for the maximum possible sum. This involves incrementally modifying the permutation to reach the desired sum.

    ### Code Snippet from Official Solution:
    The official solution uses a structured approach to handle both even and odd cases, ensuring that the permutation is constructed correctly based on the conditions derived from \( K \).

    ```python
    if(n%2==0):
        if(k<(n*(n+1))//2 - 1  or  k>3*((n//2)**2) - 1): print(-1)
        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation
    else:
        if(n==1): print(1) if(k==0) else print(-1)
        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    The official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. My previous attempts failed primarily due to not fully accounting for the bounds of \( K \) and the systematic construction of the permutation. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and the need for a structured approach to constructing solutions in combinatorial problems.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts for Permutation Problem

    The task was to find a permutation of numbers from 1 to N such that the function \( f(P) \) equals a given integer \( K \). The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a permutation of size \( N \) is \( N(N-1)/2 \).

    #### Key Insights:
    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \( f(P) \) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \( K \) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.
    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \( f(P) \)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \( K \) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.

    #### Issues Encountered:
    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \( K \). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.
    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.

    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:
    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.
    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.

    #### Final Code Snippet:
    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \( K \). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.

    ```python
    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order
        
            if K > max_value:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                # Start with descending order
                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))
                current_sum = max_value
            
                # Adjust the permutation to reach K
                for i in range(N - 1):
                    if current_sum == K:
                        break
                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K
                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)
                    if max_reduce > 0:
                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce
                        current_sum -= max_reduce
            
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, permutation)))
    
        print("\n".join(map(str, results)))
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. Given multiple queries for different values of I and K, we need to compute the results efficiently, especially since the number of queries can be very large.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how subsets are formed and how to count them based on the position of a specific element. The key steps are:
   - For each query, check if the position K is valid (i.e., K should not exceed the total number of elements in the subset).
   - If valid, calculate how many elements can be chosen from the remaining numbers (those less than I) to fill the positions before K, and how many can be chosen from the numbers greater than I to fill the positions after K.
   - Use combinatorial mathematics (specifically binomial coefficients) to count the valid combinations of elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_binomial_coefficient(n, k):
       if k > n or k < 0:
           return 0
       if k == 0 or k == n:
           return 1

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. Given multiple queries for different values of I and K, we need to compute the results efficiently, especially since the number of queries can be very large.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how subsets are formed and how to count them based on the position of a specific element. The key steps are:
   - For each query, check if the position K is valid (i.e., K should not exceed the total number of elements in the subset).
   - If valid, calculate how many elements can be chosen from the remaining numbers (those less than I) to fill the positions before K, and how many can be chosen from the numbers greater than I to fill the positions after K.
   - Use combinatorial mathematics (specifically binomial coefficients) to count the valid combinations of elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset.
   - The output should be the count of such subsets for each query.

2. **Identifying the Requirements**:
   - For a number I to be at position K in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers less than I before it in the subset.
   - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.

3. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code checks if K is valid and if I is less than K, which is correct.
   - However, the calculation of the total subsets seems to be incorrect. Specifically, the way we calculate the binomial coefficients and how we combine them might not be correctly reflecting the requirements of the problem.

4. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The calculation of the binomial coefficients does not account for the fact that we need to choose K-1 elements from the left side (less than I) and the remaining elements from the right side (greater than I).
   - The logic for combining these counts might not be correctly implemented.

5. **Correcting the Approach**:
   - We need to ensure that we are correctly calculating the number of ways to choose K-1 elements from the left side and the remaining elements from the right side.
   - The total number of subsets should be calculated as:
     - Choose K-1 elements from the left (which are less than I).
     - Choose any number of elements from the right (which are greater than I).

6. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will revise the binomial coefficient calculation to ensure it is correctly implemented.
   - We will also ensure that we are correctly calculating the number of subsets based on the counts of elements on either side of I.

Here is the revised code:

```python
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    # Calculate binomial coefficient C(n, k)
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    # Using a simple iterative approach to calculate C(n, k)
    res = 1
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
    return res

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
        index += 1
        
        for __ in range(Q):
            I, K = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read I and K
            index += 1
            
            if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                results.append(0)
                continue
            
            left_count = I - 1  # Numbers less than I
            right_count = N - I  # Numbers greater than I
            
            # Calculate the number of valid subsets
            # Choose K-1 from left_count and any from right_count
            total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
            results.append(total_subsets)
    
    # Print all results for each query
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

solve()
```

### Key Changes:
- The total subsets calculation now includes `(1 << right_count)`, which represents choosing any subset from the right side (2^right_count).
- This ensures that we correctly account for all combinations of elements greater than I while ensuring I is at the Kth position.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. Given multiple queries for different values of I and K, we need to compute the results efficiently, especially since the number of queries can be very large.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how subsets are formed and how to count them based on the position of a specific element. The key steps are:
   - For each query, check if the position K is valid (i.e., K should not exceed the total number of elements in the subset).
   - If valid, calculate how many elements can be chosen from the remaining numbers (those less than I) to fill the positions before K, and how many can be chosen from the numbers greater than I to fill the positions after K.
   - Use combinatorial mathematics (specifically binomial coefficients) to count the valid combinations of elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_binomial_coefficient(n, k):
       if k > n or k < 0:
           return 0
       if k == 0 or k == n:

               left_count = I - 1
               right_count = N - I
               total_subsets = calculate_binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * calculate_binomial_coefficient(right_count, N - K)
               print total_subsets % (10**9 + 7)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset.
   - The output should be the count of such subsets for each query.

2. **Identifying the Requirements**:
   - For a number I to be at position K in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers less than I before it in the subset.
   - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.

3. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code checks if K is valid and if I is less than K, which is correct.
   - However, the calculation of the total subsets seems to be incorrect. Specifically, the way we calculate the binomial coefficients and how we combine them might not be correctly reflecting the requirements of the problem.

4. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The calculation of the binomial coefficients does not account for the fact that we need to choose K-1 elements from the left side (less than I) and the remaining elements from the right side (greater than I).
   - The logic for combining these counts might not be correctly implemented.

5. **Correcting the Approach**:
   - We need to ensure that we are correctly calculating the number of ways to choose K-1 elements from the left side and the remaining elements from the right side.
   - The total number of subsets should be calculated as:
     - Choose K-1 elements from the left (which are less than I).
     - Choose any number of elements from the right (which are greater than I).

6. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will revise the binomial coefficient calculation to ensure it is correctly implemented.
   - We will also ensure that we are correctly calculating the number of subsets based on the counts of elements on either side of I.

Here is the revised code:

```python
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    # Calculate binomial coefficient C(n, k)
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    # Using a simple iterative approach to calculate C(n, k)
    res = 1
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
    return res

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
        index += 1
        
        for __ in range(Q):
            I, K = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read I and K
            index += 1
            
            if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                results.append(0)
                continue
            
            left_count = I - 1  # Numbers less than I
            right_count = N - I  # Numbers greater than I
            
            # Calculate the number of valid subsets
            # Choose K-1 from left_count and any from right_count
            total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
            results.append(total_subsets)
    
    # Print all results for each query
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

solve()
```

### Key Changes:
- The total subsets calculation now includes `(1 << right_count)`, which represents choosing any subset from the right side (2^right_count).
- This ensures that we correctly account for all combinations of elements greater than I while ensuring I is at the Kth position.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []

            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    In my attempts to solve the permutation problem, I learned several key insights about the approach and logic required to derive a valid permutation that meets the specified conditions. 

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: The function \( f(P) \) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \( f(P) \) for a permutation of size \( N \) is \( N(N-1)/2 \). This understanding is crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a specific \( K \).

    2. **Feasibility Conditions**: The official solution checks specific conditions to determine if \( K \) is achievable:
       - For even \( N \), \( K \) must be within the bounds of \( (N(N+1)/2 - 1) \) and \( 3((N/2)^2) - 1 \).
       - For odd \( N \), similar bounds apply, but with adjustments for the odd case.

    3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution constructs the permutation by:
       - Starting with a descending order.
       - Adjusting elements based on the difference between the desired \( K \) and the maximum possible sum.
       - Using a systematic approach to fill in the permutation while ensuring that the conditions for \( K \) are met.

    4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution employs an iterative method to adjust the permutation based on the remaining value of \( K \) after accounting for the maximum possible sum. This involves incrementally modifying the permutation to reach the desired sum.

    ### Code Snippet from Official Solution:
    The official solution uses a structured approach to handle both even and odd cases, ensuring that the permutation is constructed correctly based on the conditions derived from \( K \).

    ```python
    if(n%2==0):
        if(k<(n*(n+1))//2 - 1  or  k>3*((n//2)**2) - 1): print(-1)
        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation
    else:
        if(n==1): print(1) if(k==0) else print(-1)
        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation
    ```

    ### Conclusion:
    The official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. My previous attempts failed primarily due to not fully accounting for the bounds of \( K \) and the systematic construction of the permutation. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and the need for a structured approach to constructing solutions in combinatorial problems.

[Summary]:
    In attempting to solve the problem of determining how many magnets can attract pieces of iron based on given conditions, several key concepts and strategies emerged. The problem required careful management of segments of a string that represented cells containing magnets, iron, conducting sheets, and blocked cells. The attraction power between magnets and iron was influenced by their distance, the number of conducting sheets in between, and a constant \( K \).

    The main challenges included correctly calculating the attraction power and managing the segments when encountering blocked cells ('X'). The initial attempts failed to properly reset the lists of magnets and irons after encountering a blocked cell, leading to incorrect counts of valid pairs. Additionally, the attraction power calculation did not account for the conducting sheets correctly.

    A successful strategy would involve iterating through the string, collecting magnets, irons, and conducting sheets until a blocked cell is encountered. Upon encountering a blocked cell, the attraction for the collected magnets and irons should be evaluated, and the lists should be reset for the next segment. After processing the entire string, any remaining magnets and irons should also be evaluated.

    Here’s a relevant code snippet that outlines the corrected approach:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()

        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, K = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and K
            index += 1
            S = data[index]  # Read the string S
            index += 1
        
            magnets = []
            irons = []
            conducting_sheets = 0
            total_pairs = 0
        
            for i in range(N):
                if S[i] == 'M':
                    magnets.append(i)

                        for j in irons:
                            attraction_power = K + 1 - abs(j - m) - conducting_sheets
                            if attraction_power > 0:
                                total_pairs += 1
                    # Reset for the next segment

                    irons.clear()
                    conducting_sheets = 0
        
            # Handle any remaining magnets and irons after the last segment
            for m in magnets:
                for j in irons:
                    attraction_power = K + 1 - abs(j - m) - conducting_sheets
                    if attraction_power > 0:
                        total_pairs += 1

### Key Changes Explained:
1. **Binomial Coefficient Calculation**: The function `binomial_coefficient` calculates the number of ways to choose `k` elements from `n` elements using an iterative approach.
2. **Subset Calculation**: For each query, we check if the conditions for `K` and `I` are valid. If they are, we calculate:
   - The number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from the numbers less than `I`.
   - The number of ways to choose any subset from the numbers greater than `I`, which is represented by `2^right_count` (using bit shifting).
3. **Output**: The results are collected and printed at once to optimize performance, especially given the potentially large number of queries.

This code should now correctly handle the problem as specified and pass all test cases.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. Given multiple queries for different values of I and K, we need to compute the results efficiently, especially since the number of queries can be very large.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how subsets are formed and how to count them based on the position of a specific element. The key steps are:
   - For each query, check if the position K is valid (i.e., K should not exceed the total number of elements in the subset).
   - If valid, calculate how many elements can be chosen from the remaining numbers (those less than I) to fill the positions before K, and how many can be chosen from the numbers greater than I to fill the positions after K.
   - Use combinatorial mathematics (specifically binomial coefficients) to count the valid combinations of elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_binomial_coefficient(n, k):
       if k > n or k < 0:
           return 0
       if k == 0 or k == n:
           return 1
       return calculate_binomial_coefficient(n-1, k-1) + calculate_binomial_coefficient(n-1, k)

       read T
       for each test case:
           read N, Q
           precompute binomial coefficients up to N

               read I, K
               if K > N or K < 1:
                   print 0
                   continue

               left_count = I - 1
               right_count = N - I
               total_subsets = calculate_binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * calculate_binomial_coefficient(right_count, N - K)
               print total_subsets % (10**9 + 7)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset.
   - The output should be the count of such subsets for each query.

2. **Identifying the Requirements**:
   - For a number I to be at position K in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers less than I before it in the subset.
   - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.

3. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code checks if K is valid and if I is less than K, which is correct.
   - However, the calculation of the total subsets seems to be incorrect. Specifically, the way we calculate the binomial coefficients and how we combine them might not be correctly reflecting the requirements of the problem.

4. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The calculation of the binomial coefficients does not account for the fact that we need to choose K-1 elements from the left side (less than I) and the remaining elements from the right side (greater than I).
   - The logic for combining these counts might not be correctly implemented.

5. **Correcting the Approach**:
   - We need to ensure that we are correctly calculating the number of ways to choose K-1 elements from the left side and the remaining elements from the right side.
   - The total number of subsets should be calculated as:
     - Choose K-1 elements from the left (which are less than I).
     - Choose any number of elements from the right (which are greater than I).

6. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will revise the binomial coefficient calculation to ensure it is correctly implemented.
   - We will also ensure that we are correctly calculating the number of subsets based on the counts of elements on either side of I.

Here is the revised code:

```python
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    # Calculate binomial coefficient C(n, k)
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    # Using a simple iterative approach to calculate C(n, k)
    res = 1
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
    return res

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
        index += 1
        
        for __ in range(Q):
            I, K = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read I and K
            index += 1
            
            if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                results.append(0)
                continue
            
            left_count = I - 1  # Numbers less than I
            right_count = N - I  # Numbers greater than I
            
            # Calculate the number of valid subsets
            # Choose K-1 from left_count and any from right_count
            total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
            results.append(total_subsets)
    
    # Print all results for each query
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

solve()
```

### Key Changes:
- The total subsets calculation now includes `(1 << right_count)`, which represents choosing any subset from the right side (2^right_count).
- This ensures that we correctly account for all combinations of elements greater than I while ensuring I is at the Kth position.

### Key Changes Explained:
1. **Binomial Coefficient Calculation**: The function `binomial_coefficient` calculates the number of ways to choose `k` elements from `n` elements using an iterative approach.
2. **Subset Calculation**: For each query, we check if the conditions for `K` and `I` are valid. If they are, we calculate:

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    res = 1
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
    return res

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
        index += 1
        
        for __ in range(Q):
            I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
            
            if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                results.append(0)
                continue
            
            left_count = I - 1
            right_count = N - I
            
            total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
            results.append(total_subsets)
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


-----Input:-----
- The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
- For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
- Next Q line contains two number I and K.

-----Output:-----
For each test case print required answer.

-----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=1000000
Subtask 3: 5 points
- 1<=T<=5
- 1<=N, K<=16
- 1<=Q<=1000
Subtask 1: 25 points
- T=1
- 1<=N, K<=4000
- 1<=Q<=100000
Subtask 2: 70 points
- Original Constraints.

-----Example:-----
Input:

1

3 3

1 2

2 1

3 2

Output:

0

2

2

-----Explanation:-----
For N=3

total subsets are:

{1}

{2}

{3}

{1,2}

{1,3}

{2,3}

{1,2,3}

Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} such that a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. Given multiple queries for different values of I and K, we need to compute the results efficiently, especially since the number of queries can be very large.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to understand how subsets are formed and how to count them based on the position of a specific element. The key steps are:
   - For each query, check if the position K is valid (i.e., K should not exceed the total number of elements in the subset).
   - If valid, calculate how many elements can be chosen from the remaining numbers (those less than I) to fill the positions before K, and how many can be chosen from the numbers greater than I to fill the positions after K.
   - Use combinatorial mathematics (specifically binomial coefficients) to count the valid combinations of elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function calculate_binomial_coefficient(n, k):
       if k > n or k < 0:
           return 0
       if k == 0 or k == n:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset.
   - The output should be the count of such subsets for each query.

2. **Identifying the Requirements**:
   - For a number I to be at position K in a subset, there must be exactly K-1 numbers less than I before it in the subset.
   - The remaining numbers in the subset can be chosen from the numbers greater than I.

3. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code checks if K is valid and if I is less than K, which is correct.
   - However, the calculation of the total subsets seems to be incorrect. Specifically, the way we calculate the binomial coefficients and how we combine them might not be correctly reflecting the requirements of the problem.

4. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The calculation of the binomial coefficients does not account for the fact that we need to choose K-1 elements from the left side (less than I) and the remaining elements from the right side (greater than I).
   - The logic for combining these counts might not be correctly implemented.

5. **Correcting the Approach**:
   - We need to ensure that we are correctly calculating the number of ways to choose K-1 elements from the left side and the remaining elements from the right side.
   - The total number of subsets should be calculated as:
     - Choose K-1 elements from the left (which are less than I).
     - Choose any number of elements from the right (which are greater than I).

6. **Revising the Code**:
   - We will revise the binomial coefficient calculation to ensure it is correctly implemented.
   - We will also ensure that we are correctly calculating the number of subsets based on the counts of elements on either side of I.

Here is the revised code:

```python
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    # Calculate binomial coefficient C(n, k)
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    # Using a simple iterative approach to calculate C(n, k)
    res = 1
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
    return res

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(T):
        N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
        index += 1
        
        for __ in range(Q):
            I, K = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read I and K
            index += 1
            
            if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                results.append(0)
                continue
            
            left_count = I - 1  # Numbers less than I
            right_count = N - I  # Numbers greater than I
            
            # Calculate the number of valid subsets
            # Choose K-1 from left_count and any from right_count
            total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
            results.append(total_subsets)
    
    # Print all results for each query
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

solve()
```

### Key Changes:
- The total subsets calculation now includes `(1 << right_count)`, which represents choosing any subset from the right side (2^right_count).
- This ensures that we correctly account for all combinations of elements greater than I while ensuring I is at the Kth position.

    # Print all results for each query
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

```

### Key Changes Explained:
1. **Binomial Coefficient Calculation**: The function `binomial_coefficient` calculates the number of ways to choose `k` elements from `n` elements using an iterative approach.
2. **Subset Calculation**: For each query, we check if the conditions for `K` and `I` are valid. If they are, we calculate:
   - The number of ways to choose `K-1` elements from the numbers less than `I`.
   - The number of ways to choose any subset from the numbers greater than `I`, which is represented by `2^right_count` (using bit shifting).
3. **Output**: The results are collected and printed at once to optimize performance, especially given the potentially large number of queries.

INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I gained several insights regarding the approach to counting subsets with specific conditions. The official solution provided a more efficient and straightforward method for calculating the required counts, which I can distill into key steps:

1. **Understanding Position Constraints**: The official solution correctly identifies that if the position `K` is greater than the number `I`, the result is immediately `0`. This is a crucial check that simplifies the problem.

2. **Efficient Calculation of Combinations**: Instead of using a separate function for binomial coefficients, the official solution calculates combinations directly using a loop. This avoids the overhead of function calls and allows for more control over the calculation process.

3. **Power of Two for Subset Counting**: The official solution uses `2**(n-i)` to count the number of subsets that can be formed from the elements greater than `I`. This is a concise way to represent the total combinations of those elements.

4. **Iterative Factorial Calculation**: The official solution uses a loop to compute the factorial division needed for combinations, which is efficient and avoids potential overflow issues that could arise with large factorials.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7`, which is a common practice in competitive programming to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.

Overall, the official solution is more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts while ensuring that all edge cases are handled. My initial approach, while conceptually correct, was less efficient and did not account for all edge cases as effectively as the official solution. This experience highlights the importance of considering both the mathematical properties of combinations and the computational efficiency of the implementation.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 1203 [generation text] This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, N and Q, followed by Q queries. For each query, it checks the validity of the parameters I and K, and if valid, calculates the number of valid subsets that can be formed based on the given conditions. It utilizes a binomial coefficient calculation to determine the number of ways to choose elements from a specified range. The results for each query are collected and printed at the end. The function also ensures that results are computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Overall, it efficiently handles combinatorial calculations for multiple queries in a single execution.

[Problem]
    Given a set of  N  natural numbers 1,2,3........N and Q query.For each query you have to calculate the total number of subset in which  Ith.
    number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
    The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


    -----Input:-----
    - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
    - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
    - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

    -----Output:-----
    For each test case print required answer.

    -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
    - 1<=T<=5
    - 1<=N, K<=4000
    - 1<=Q<=1000000
    Subtask 3: 5 points
    - 1<=T<=5
    - 1<=N, K<=16
    - 1<=Q<=1000
    Subtask 1: 25 points
    - T=1
    - 1<=N, K<=4000
    - 1<=Q<=100000
    Subtask 2: 70 points
    - Original Constraints.

    -----Example:-----
    Input:

    1

    3 3

    1 2

    2 1

    3 2

    Output:

    0

    2

    2

    -----Explanation:-----
    For N=3

    total subsets are:

    {1}

    {2}

    {3}

    {1,2}

    {1,3}

    {2,3}

    {1,2,3}

    Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

    For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

    Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.
