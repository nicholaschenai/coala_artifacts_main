He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.\nMr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.\nEg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5\nOnly Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.\nEach room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.\n- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.\n- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.\n\n-----Output:-----\nMaximum money obtained.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5\n- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4\n- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100\n- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 1\n3\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n12\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nFor the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. \nThis is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

He can only unlock the first or last room initially, and he has a limited number of keys to unlock additional rooms. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect by strategically using the keys to unlock the rooms.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will consider the maximum money that can be collected by unlocking rooms from either end of the row. We will keep track of the total money collected as we unlock rooms, ensuring that we do not exceed the number of keys available.

The core concept involved sorting the prices to prioritize cheaper chocolates, allowing for the maximization of the quantity purchased within the budget constraints.\n\n    The solution strategy was straightforward: sort the prices in ascending order, then iterate through the sorted list, keeping track of the total spent and the number of chocolates bought. The iteration stops when adding another chocolate's price would exceed the budget. This greedy approach effectively ensures that the maximum number of chocolates is purchased.\n\n    The implementation was successful, with the provided code passing the sample test case. The key takeaway is the importance of sorting and a greedy algorithm in optimization problems involving budget constraints. The solution was efficient and adhered to the problem's constraints, demonstrating a clear understanding of the requirements. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):\n        prices.sort()\n        total_spent = 0\n        chocolates_bought = 0\n    \n        for price in prices:\n            if total_spent + price <= k:\n                total_spent += price\n                chocolates_bought += 1\n            else:\n                break\n    \n        return chocolates_bought\n\n    n, k = map(int, input().split())\n    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    result = max_chocolates(n, k, prices)\n    print(result)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the effectiveness of sorting and greedy algorithms in solving optimization problems efficiently.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money to a group of minions such that he ends up with exactly zero money left. The key concepts involved were understanding the total demand from the minions and ensuring that each individual demand could be satisfied without exceeding the amount of money Gru had at any point.\n\n    Initially, the approach was to simply check if the total demand equaled the amount of money Gru had. However, this was insufficient because it did not account for the individual demands of the minions. The correct approach required checking both the total demand and ensuring that each individual demand was less than or equal to the money Gru had.\n\n    The final solution involved calculating the total demand and checking if it matched Gru's total money. If it did, the output was \"YES\"; otherwise, it was \"NO\". However, the solution failed to pass the tests because it did not consider the scenario where the total demand could be less than Gru's money but still not allow for exact distribution.\n\n    The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of considering both aggregate and individual constraints when solving distribution problems. The final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Extract number of minions and amount of money Gru has\n            A = case[2]  # Extract the list of demands from minions\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)  # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by minions\n        \n            # Check if the total demand equals the money Gru has\n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")  # Gru can distribute the money exactly\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")  # Gru cannot distribute the money as required\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the need for careful consideration of problem constraints and the importance of validating both total and individual conditions in distribution scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
