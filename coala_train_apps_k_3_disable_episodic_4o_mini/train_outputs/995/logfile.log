## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Mr. Krabs is in a bank with a row of rooms, each containing some money. He can only unlock the first or last room initially, and he has a limited number of keys to unlock additional rooms. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money he can collect by strategically using the keys to unlock the rooms.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will consider the maximum money that can be collected by unlocking rooms from either end of the row. We will keep track of the total money collected as we unlock rooms, ensuring that we do not exceed the number of keys available. We will explore both directions (from the left and from the right) and calculate the maximum money obtainable by unlocking rooms in a way that maximizes the total amount collected.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_money(n, A, k):
       left_money = 0
       right_money = 0
       
       // Calculate money from the left side
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           left_money += A[i]
       
       // Calculate money from the right side
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
       
       // Find the maximum money obtainable
       max_money = max(left_money, right_money)
       
       // Check combinations of keys used from both sides
       for i from 1 to k - 1:
           if i < n and (k - i) < n:
               current_money = sum of A[0 to i-1] + sum of A[n - 1 to n - (k - i)]
               max_money = max(max_money, current_money)
       
       return max_money
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_money(n, A, k):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of money collected from both ends
    left_money = 0
    right_money = 0
    
    # Calculate total money that can be collected from the left side
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        left_money += A[i]
    
    # Calculate total money that can be collected from the right side
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
    
    # Start with the maximum money obtainable from either side
    max_money = max(left_money, right_money)
    
    # Check combinations of keys used from both sides
    for i in range(1, k):
        if i < n and (k - i) < n:

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy given a list of prices and a budget. The core concept involved sorting the prices to prioritize cheaper chocolates, allowing for the maximization of the quantity purchased within the budget constraints.

    The solution strategy was straightforward: sort the prices in ascending order, then iterate through the sorted list, keeping track of the total spent and the number of chocolates bought. The iteration stops when adding another chocolate's price would exceed the budget. This greedy approach effectively ensures that the maximum number of chocolates is purchased.

    The implementation was successful, with the provided code passing the sample test case. The key takeaway is the importance of sorting and a greedy algorithm in optimization problems involving budget constraints. The solution was efficient and adhered to the problem's constraints, demonstrating a clear understanding of the requirements. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
        prices.sort()
        total_spent = 0
        chocolates_bought = 0
    
        for price in prices:
            if total_spent + price <= k:
                total_spent += price
                chocolates_bought += 1
            else:
                break
    
        return chocolates_bought

    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = max_chocolates(n, k, prices)
    print(result)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the effectiveness of sorting and greedy algorithms in solving optimization problems efficiently.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money to a group of minions such that he ends up with exactly zero money left. The key concepts involved were understanding the total demand from the minions and ensuring that each individual demand could be satisfied without exceeding the amount of money Gru had at any point.

    Initially, the approach was to simply check if the total demand equaled the amount of money Gru had. However, this was insufficient because it did not account for the individual demands of the minions. The correct approach required checking both the total demand and ensuring that each individual demand was less than or equal to the money Gru had.

    The final solution involved calculating the total demand and checking if it matched Gru's total money. If it did, the output was "YES"; otherwise, it was "NO". However, the solution failed to pass the tests because it did not consider the scenario where the total demand could be less than Gru's money but still not allow for exact distribution.

    The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of considering both aggregate and individual constraints when solving distribution problems. The final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Extract number of minions and amount of money Gru has
            A = case[2]  # Extract the list of demands from minions
        
            total_demand = sum(A)  # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by minions
        
            # Check if the total demand equals the money Gru has
            if total_demand == K:
                print("YES")  # Gru can distribute the money exactly
            else:
                print("NO")  # Gru cannot distribute the money as required
    ```

    This experience highlighted the need for careful consideration of problem constraints and the importance of validating both total and individual conditions in distribution scenarios.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**:
   Mr. Krabs is in a bank with `n` rooms arranged in a row, where only the first and last rooms can be accessed initially. Each room contains a certain amount of money, and Mr. Krabs has `k` keys to unlock the rooms. He can only unlock adjacent rooms after unlocking a room next to them. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money Mr. Krabs can collect using the `k` keys.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will consider two scenarios: unlocking rooms starting from the leftmost room and unlocking rooms starting from the rightmost room. For each scenario, we will keep track of the total money collected and the number of keys used. We will then compare the maximum money collected from both scenarios to find the overall maximum.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function max_money(n, A, k):
       left_money = 0
       right_money = 0
       
       // Calculate money collected from the left
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           left_money += A[i]
       
       // Calculate money collected from the right
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
       
       // Compare the two scenarios
       return max(left_money, right_money)
   
   // Read input values
   n = read integer
   A = read list of integers
   k = read integer
   
   // Call the function and print the result
   result = max_money(n, A, k)
   print(result)
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def max_money(n, A, k):
    left_money = 0
    right_money = 0
    
    # Calculate money collected from the left
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        left_money += A[i]
    
    # Calculate money collected from the right
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
    
    # Compare the two scenarios
    return max(left_money, right_money)

# Read input values
n = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
k = int(input())

# Call the function and print the result
result = max_money(n, A, k)
print(result)
``` 

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum money Mr. Krabs can collect by considering both ends of the row of rooms and using the keys optimally.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Mr. Krabs loves money. He enters a bank and sees that there are n rooms arranged in a row. The only rooms with doors are the two rooms on either corner. Initially, all the rooms are locked (including the corner ones). To enter a room, it must be unlocked with a key.
Mr. Krabs is able to steal k keys from the sleeping night guard. Each key can be used to unlock only one room. To reach one of the inner rooms, he has to unlock an adjacent room first.
Eg: If there are 5 rooms labelled: 1 2 3 4 5
Only Rooms 1 and 5 can be accessed initially. To unlock room 2, either room 1 or room 3 must be unlocked. Similarly to unlock Room 4, he must unlock room 5 or room 3 first.
Each room has some money in it. The money present in room i is given by A[i]. Using the k keys, calculate what is the maximum possible amount of money obtainable.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain n,  number of rooms.
- Second line will contain space separated integers, denoting A[i], money present in each room.
- Third line will contain an integer, k, the number of keys available.

-----Output:-----
Maximum money obtained.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 10^5
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= Number of Rooms

-----Subtasks-----
- 40 points : 1 <= Number of Rooms <= 100
- 60 points : Number of Rooms > 100

-----Sample Input:-----
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 1
3

-----Sample Output:-----
12

-----Explanation:-----
For the first step, Mr. Krabs can only unlock the room at the left corner or the right corner. If he unlocks the room in the right corner, he obtains 1 dollar. He can then go on to unlock the second last room and gain 6 dollars, for a total of 7 dollars. Finally he can unlock the third last room and get 5 dollars, for a total of 12 dollars. 
This is the maximum amount of money he can get with only 3 keys.

INFO - [Task id] 995 [prompt] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**:
   Mr. Krabs is in a bank with `n` rooms arranged in a row, where only the first and last rooms can be accessed initially. Each room contains a certain amount of money, and Mr. Krabs has `k` keys to unlock the rooms. He can only unlock adjacent rooms after unlocking a room next to them. The goal is to determine the maximum amount of money Mr. Krabs can collect using the `k` keys.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:
   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will consider two scenarios: unlocking rooms starting from the leftmost room and unlocking rooms starting from the rightmost room. For each scenario, we will keep track of the total money collected and the number of keys used. We will then compare the maximum money collected from both scenarios to find the overall maximum.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function max_money(n, A, k):
       left_money = 0
       right_money = 0
       
       // Calculate money collected from the left
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           left_money += A[i]
       
       // Calculate money collected from the right
       for i from 0 to min(k, n) - 1:
           right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
       
       // Compare the two scenarios

   A = read list of integers
   k = read integer
   
   // Call the function and print the result
   result = max_money(n, A, k)
   print(result)
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def max_money(n, A, k):
    left_money = 0
    right_money = 0
    
    # Calculate money collected from the left
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        left_money += A[i]
    
    # Calculate money collected from the right
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        right_money += A[n - 1 - i]

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine the maximum amount of money Mr. Krabs could collect from a series of rooms using a limited number of keys. The key concepts involved understanding the constraints of unlocking adjacent rooms and optimizing the collection of money from either end of the row of rooms.

The solution utilized a greedy approach by calculating the total money collectible from both the leftmost and rightmost rooms, given the number of keys available. This involved iterating through the first `k` rooms from the left and the last `k` rooms from the right, then comparing the two totals to find the maximum.

The final implementation was straightforward and efficient, handling the constraints well. The code successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The key takeaway was the importance of considering both ends of a linear structure when faced with constraints on access, which is a common pattern in similar optimization problems. 

Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
def max_money(n, A, k):
    left_money = 0
    right_money = 0
    
    # Calculate money collected from the left
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        left_money += A[i]
    
    # Calculate money collected from the right
    for i in range(min(k, n)):
        right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
    
    # Compare the two scenarios
    return max(left_money, right_money)

# Read input values
n = int(input())
A = list(map(int, input().split()))
k = int(input())

# Call the function and print the result
result = max_money(n, A, k)
print(result)
``` 

This experience reinforced the value of breaking down problems into manageable parts and considering multiple scenarios to find an optimal solution.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution

rev=-1
a,b=0,-1
tot=[]
#print(money[-3:-1])
x=0

    #print(money[b:-1],money[0:a])
    x=sum(money[b:])+sum(money[0:keys-abs(b)])
    tot.append(x)
    b-=1
print(max(tot))


INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] The official solution takes a different approach by iterating through the number of keys and calculating the total money that can be collected based on the current position of the keys. It uses a loop to explore all possible combinations of unlocking rooms from both ends, which allows it to capture the maximum money obtainable with the given keys.

Key insights from the official solution:
1. **Dynamic Calculation**: The solution dynamically calculates the total money for each possible combination of keys used from both ends of the room array. This is done by adjusting the indices based on the number of keys used.
2. **Use of Lists**: It maintains a list `tot` to store the total money collected for each configuration, which is then used to find the maximum.
3. **Negative Indexing**: The use of negative indexing (`b` starts at -1 and decrements) allows the solution to easily access the rooms from the right end without additional calculations.

In contrast, my initial approach was more straightforward but limited in its exploration of combinations. It only considered the total money from the leftmost and rightmost rooms separately, which could miss optimal combinations that involve unlocking rooms from both ends. 

The official solution's method of iterating through possible key distributions provides a more comprehensive view of the problem, ensuring that all potential maximums are considered. This highlights the importance of exploring multiple configurations in problems involving combinations and constraints.

The main function is `max_money`.
INFO - [Task id] 995 [generation text] This function calculates the maximum amount of money that can be collected by either taking the first 'k' elements or the last 'k' elements from a list of integers. It first sums the values from the left side of the list up to 'k' elements, then sums the values from the right side of the list up to 'k' elements. After obtaining both sums, it compares them and returns the larger value. The function ensures that it does not exceed the bounds of the list when 'k' is greater than the number of elements. This allows for a flexible approach to determine the optimal collection strategy. The result is a single integer representing the maximum money collected.
