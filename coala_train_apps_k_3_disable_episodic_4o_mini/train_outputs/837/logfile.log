INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N". We will do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - For each test case, we will find the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N. This can be done by taking the integer division of N by 10 and then multiplying by 10.
   - Once we have the largest multiple of 10, we can calculate the sum of all multiples of 10 up to that number. The multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series where the first term is 10, the last term is the largest multiple of 10, and the common difference is also 10.
   - The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of terms. The number of terms can be found by dividing the largest multiple of 10 by 10.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_of_multiples_of_10(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           largest_multiple_of_10 = (N // 10) * 10
           number_of_terms = largest_multiple_of_10 // 10
           sum = (number_of_terms / 2) * (10 + largest_multiple_of_10)
           print(sum)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10(T, test_cases):
    # Iterate through each test case
    for N in test_cases:
        # Find the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N
        largest_multiple_of_10 = (N // 10) * 10
        # Calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10
        number_of_terms = largest_multiple_of_10 // 10
        # Calculate the sum using the arithmetic series formula
        sum_of_multiples = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple_of_10)) // 2
        # Print the result for the current test case
        print(sum_of_multiples)

# Read input from standard input

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \( A[i] \) by its index \( i \) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:

    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is "YES". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is "NO". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \( N \) natural numbers.

    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \( N(N + 1)/2 \). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.

    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is zero.
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
       - Returning "NO" otherwise.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
        
            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, A))

    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning "YES" or "NO".
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.

INFO - [Task id] 837 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N". This needs to be done for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the sum of multiples of 10 up to a number N, we can identify the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to N. This can be calculated as `N // 10 * 10`. The multiples of 10 up to this number form an arithmetic series: 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest multiple. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{\text{number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
   \]
   where the first term is 10 and the last term is the largest multiple of 10.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
       largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
       number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10
       sum = (number_of_terms / 2) * (10 + largest_multiple)

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] The problem involved calculating the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The solution required understanding arithmetic series and efficiently calculating the sum without iterating through all multiples, which is crucial given the constraints (N can be as large as 1 billion).

The approach used was to determine the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, then calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10 up to that point. The sum was computed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. This method is efficient and avoids potential performance issues with large inputs.

The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway is the importance of leveraging mathematical formulas for series to optimize calculations, especially when dealing with large ranges. 

Hereâ€™s the core function used:

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):
    largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10
    number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10
    sum_multiples = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2
    return sum_multiples
```

This function efficiently computes the desired sum, demonstrating the effectiveness of using arithmetic properties in programming challenges.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for t in range(eval(input())):
 n=eval(input())
 n-=n%10
 n/=10
 print(n*(n+1)/2*10)

INFO - [Task id] 837 [generation text] The official solution provided is concise and efficient, leveraging a mathematical approach to calculate the sum of multiples of 10. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Direct Calculation**: The official solution directly computes the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N by subtracting the remainder when N is divided by 10 (`n -= n % 10`). This avoids the need for looping through all multiples of 10.

2. **Arithmetic Series Formula**: Instead of summing the multiples iteratively, the solution uses the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers, where `k` is the number of multiples of 10 up to `n/10`. The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{10} \times \left(\frac{n}{10} + 1\right) \times 10
   \]
   This efficiently computes the sum in constant time.

3. **Efficiency**: The official solution runs in O(1) time for each test case, making it very efficient even for the upper limits of the constraints (N up to 1 billion).

In contrast, my initial approach involved calculating the number of terms and the sum using a more verbose method, which, while correct, was less efficient in terms of readability and performance. The official solution's use of direct arithmetic operations simplifies the logic and reduces the potential for errors in more complex calculations.

Overall, this experience reinforces the importance of recognizing patterns in mathematical problems and utilizing formulas to simplify calculations, especially when dealing with large numbers.
