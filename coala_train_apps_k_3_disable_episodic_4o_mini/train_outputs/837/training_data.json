    "summary": "The problem involved calculating the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to a given number \"N\" for multiple test cases. The solution required understanding arithmetic series and efficiently calculating the sum without iterating through all multiples, which is crucial given the constraints (N can be as large as 1 billion).\n\nThe approach used was to determine the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N, then calculate the number of terms in the series of multiples of 10 up to that point. The sum was computed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. This method is efficient and avoids potential performance issues with large inputs.\n\nThe final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The key takeaway is the importance of leveraging mathematical formulas for series to optimize calculations, especially when dealing with large ranges. \n\nHere\u2019s the core function used:\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_multiples_of_10(N):\n    largest_multiple = (N // 10) * 10\n    number_of_terms = largest_multiple // 10\n    sum_multiples = (number_of_terms * (10 + largest_multiple)) // 2\n    return sum_multiples\n```\n\nThis function efficiently computes the desired sum, demonstrating the effectiveness of using arithmetic properties in programming challenges.",
    "reflection": "The official solution provided is concise and efficient, leveraging a mathematical approach to calculate the sum of multiples of 10. Here are the key insights from the official solution:\n\n1. **Direct Calculation**: The official solution directly computes the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to N by subtracting the remainder when N is divided by 10 (`n -= n % 10`). This avoids the need for looping through all multiples of 10.\n\n2. **Arithmetic Series Formula**: Instead of summing the multiples iteratively, the solution uses the formula for the sum of the first `k` integers, where `k` is the number of multiples of 10 up to `n/10`. The formula used is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n}{10} \\times \\left(\\frac{n}{10} + 1\\right) \\times 10\n   \\]\n   This efficiently computes the sum in constant time.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The official solution runs in O(1) time for each test case, making it very efficient even for the upper limits of the constraints (N up to 1 billion).\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach involved calculating the number of terms and the sum using a more verbose method, which, while correct, was less efficient in terms of readability and performance. The official solution's use of direct arithmetic operations simplifies the logic and reduces the potential for errors in more complex calculations.\n\nOverall, this experience reinforces the importance of recognizing patterns in mathematical problems and utilizing formulas to simplify calculations, especially when dealing with large numbers.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThe function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where the first line indicates the number of cases. For each subsequent line, it retrieves an integer value and calculates the sum of all multiples of 10 that are less than or equal to that integer. The results for each test case are collected in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. This allows for efficient processing and output of the sums for all provided test cases. The function effectively handles input and output while performing arithmetic calculations based on the input values.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to calculate the sum of multiples of a specific number (in this case, 10) efficiently, especially when dealing with large upper limits (up to 1 billion). It can be applied in programming contests, algorithm design, or any situation where performance is critical and direct iteration over a large range would be inefficient. Understanding how to leverage arithmetic series for such calculations can also help in optimizing similar problems involving sums of multiples."
