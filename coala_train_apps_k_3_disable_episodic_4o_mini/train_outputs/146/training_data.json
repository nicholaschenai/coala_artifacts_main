    "summary": "The problem involved decoding a string formatted with patterns like `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string`. The solution required parsing the string while managing nested structures, which is a common pattern in problems involving brackets.\n\nThe approach utilized a stack to keep track of the current string and the repeat count. As we iterated through the string, we built numbers for repeat counts, pushed the current state onto the stack when encountering `[`, and popped from the stack to construct the final string when encountering `]`. This method effectively handled nested encodings.\n\nThe final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. Key concepts included managing state with a stack and handling string concatenation efficiently. The solution demonstrated the importance of careful parsing and state management in problems involving nested structures. \n\nHere\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n        stack = []\n        current_string = \"\"\n        number = 0\n        \n        for char in s:\n            if char.isdigit():\n                number = number * 10 + int(char)\n            elif char == '[':\n                stack.append((current_string, number))\n                current_string = \"\"\n                number = 0\n            elif char == ']':\n                last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count\n            else:\n                current_string += char\n        \n        return current_string\n``` \n\nThis experience reinforced the utility of stacks in managing nested structures and the importance of careful iteration and state management in string manipulation tasks.",
    "reflection": "The official solution effectively utilizes a stack to manage the decoding of the string, which is a common approach for problems involving nested structures. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by initializing a stack with a base entry of an empty string and a count of 1. This serves as a foundation for building the final decoded string.\n\n2. **Building the Number**: As the solution iterates through each character, it builds the number when digits are encountered. This is done by appending digits to a string until a non-digit character is found.\n\n3. **Handling Opening Brackets**: When an opening bracket `[` is encountered, the current number (which indicates how many times the subsequent string should be repeated) is converted to an integer and pushed onto the stack along with an empty string to start building the new segment.\n\n4. **Handling Closing Brackets**: Upon encountering a closing bracket `]`, the solution pops the last string and its repeat count from the stack. It then appends the repeated string to the last string in the stack, effectively building the decoded string segment.\n\n5. **Appending Characters**: For any other character, it appends the character to the most recent string in the stack, ensuring that the current segment is being built correctly.\n\n6. **Final Output**: The final decoded string is retrieved from the first element of the stack after processing all characters.\n\nThe official solution is concise and effectively handles the nested structure of the encoded string. My initial approach was similar but lacked the clarity in managing the stack and the number building, particularly in how the segments were combined. The official solution's use of a list to store both the string and the repeat count together in the stack is a more elegant way to manage the state during decoding. \n\nOverall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, demonstrating a clear understanding of stack operations in the context of string manipulation.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThis function decodes a string that contains encoded segments in the format of numbers followed by brackets, where the number indicates how many times the string inside the brackets should be repeated. It uses a stack to keep track of the current string and the repeat count whenever it encounters an opening bracket. As it processes each character, it builds numbers for repeat counts and constructs the current string. When it encounters a closing bracket, it pops the last string and repeat count from the stack, repeats the current string accordingly, and appends it to the last string. The function continues this process until all characters are processed. Finally, it returns the fully decoded string.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where you need to decode strings that follow a specific encoding pattern, such as in data compression, parsing encoded messages, or handling input formats in programming contests. It can also be applied in situations where you need to manipulate or transform strings based on certain rules, such as in text processing or when implementing custom serialization/deserialization logic."
