## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to decode a string that contains encoded patterns. The encoding format is `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string` that follows it inside square brackets. Our task is to return the fully decoded string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters and numbers as we parse through the string. When we encounter a digit, we build the number until we hit a `[`, at which point we push the number and the current string onto the stack. When we encounter a `]`, we pop from the stack to get the last number and string, repeat the string that many times, and append it to the string we are currently building. This process continues until we have processed the entire input string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   Initialize an empty current_string
   Initialize a number variable to 0

   For each character in the input string:
       If the character is a digit:
           Update the number (build the complete number)
       Else if the character is '[':
           Push the current_string and the number onto the stack
           Reset current_string and number
       Else if the character is ']':
           Pop the number and the last string from the stack
           Repeat current_string the number of times and append to the last string
           Update current_string to this new string
       Else:
           Append the character to current_string

   Return current_string
   ```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by using a while loop that checks for the presence of the substring "abc" in the input string. It utilizes the `count` method to determine if "abc" exists and the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of "abc" in one go. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the string is processed until no "abc" substrings remain.

    One key insight from the official solution is the use of `s.count("abc")` to check for occurrences, which simplifies the condition for the while loop. In my initial solution, I used `in` to check for the substring, which is also valid but less explicit in terms of counting occurrences. The official solution's method is more efficient in that it directly removes all instances of "abc" in one operation, rather than removing them one at a time.

    Overall, the official solution is concise and leverages built-in string methods effectively, making it both easy to read and efficient. In future implementations, I should consider using similar built-in methods for string manipulation to enhance clarity and performance.
[/Reflection]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to rearrange a string of appetizers based on their binary indices when read upside down. The key concepts involved binary number manipulation, string reversal, and indexing. The problem required converting indices to binary, reversing those binary strings, and then converting them back to decimal to determine the new positions of the appetizers.

    The solution involved iterating through each test case, calculating the number of appetizers as `2^k`, and then for each index, performing the necessary conversions and rearrangements. The final arrangement was constructed in a list and printed as a string.

    The code was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The main operations included formatting numbers to binary, reversing strings, and converting between binary and decimal, which were efficiently implemented using Python's built-in functions. The solution passed all test cases without errors, indicating that the approach was effective and correctly addressed the problem's requirements. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def rearrange_appetizers(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            k, appetizers_string = case.split()
            k = int(k)
            n = 2 ** k
            result = [''] * n
        
            for i in range(n):
                binary_index = format(i, '0' + str(k) + 'b')
                reversed_index = binary_index[::-1]
                new_index = int(reversed_index, 2)
                result[new_index] = appetizers_string[i]
        
            print(''.join(result))

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(T)]
    rearrange_appetizers(T, test_cases)
    ```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


Examples:

s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with:

INFO - [Task id] 146 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to decode a string that contains encoded segments in the format `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times the `encoded_string` should be repeated. The goal is to return the fully decoded string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the characters and numbers as we parse through the string. When we encounter a digit, we build the number until we hit a `[`, at which point we push the number onto the stack. When we encounter a `]`, we pop from the stack until we find the corresponding `[`, and then we repeat the string segment the number of times indicated by the popped number. We continue this process until we have processed the entire string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Initialize an empty stack
   Initialize an empty current_string
   Initialize a number variable to 0

   For each character in the input string:
       If the character is a digit:
           Update the number (build the number)
       Else if the character is '[':
           Push the current_string and the number onto the stack
           Reset current_string and number
       Else if the character is ']':

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] The problem involved decoding a string formatted with patterns like `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is a positive integer indicating how many times to repeat the `encoded_string`. The solution required parsing the string while managing nested structures, which is a common pattern in problems involving brackets.

The approach utilized a stack to keep track of the current string and the repeat count. As we iterated through the string, we built numbers for repeat counts, pushed the current state onto the stack when encountering `[`, and popped from the stack to construct the final string when encountering `]`. This method effectively handled nested encodings.

The final implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. Key concepts included managing state with a stack and handling string concatenation efficiently. The solution demonstrated the importance of careful parsing and state management in problems involving nested structures. 

Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        current_string = ""
        number = 0
        
        for char in s:
            if char.isdigit():
                number = number * 10 + int(char)
            elif char == '[':
                stack.append((current_string, number))
                current_string = ""
                number = 0
            elif char == ']':
                last_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()
                current_string = last_string + current_string * repeat_count
            else:
                current_string += char
        
        return current_string
``` 

This experience reinforced the utility of stacks in managing nested structures and the importance of careful iteration and state management in string manipulation tasks.

INFO - [Task id] 146 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes a stack to manage the decoding of the string, which is a common approach for problems involving nested structures. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Initialization**: The solution starts by initializing a stack with a base entry of an empty string and a count of 1. This serves as a foundation for building the final decoded string.

2. **Building the Number**: As the solution iterates through each character, it builds the number when digits are encountered. This is done by appending digits to a string until a non-digit character is found.

3. **Handling Opening Brackets**: When an opening bracket `[` is encountered, the current number (which indicates how many times the subsequent string should be repeated) is converted to an integer and pushed onto the stack along with an empty string to start building the new segment.

4. **Handling Closing Brackets**: Upon encountering a closing bracket `]`, the solution pops the last string and its repeat count from the stack. It then appends the repeated string to the last string in the stack, effectively building the decoded string segment.

5. **Appending Characters**: For any other character, it appends the character to the most recent string in the stack, ensuring that the current segment is being built correctly.

6. **Final Output**: The final decoded string is retrieved from the first element of the stack after processing all characters.

The official solution is concise and effectively handles the nested structure of the encoded string. My initial approach was similar but lacked the clarity in managing the stack and the number building, particularly in how the segments were combined. The official solution's use of a list to store both the string and the repeat count together in the stack is a more elegant way to manage the state during decoding. 

Overall, the official solution is efficient and straightforward, demonstrating a clear understanding of stack operations in the context of string manipulation.
