## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 105
- 1 â‰¤ Ri â‰¤ N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.
- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.

-----Subtasks-----

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef is investigating a murder case involving a mafia organization. Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and there is a single Don who reports to no one (indicated by a reporting value of 0). The task is to identify the members of the mafia who are not reported to by anyone else, as these members are considered potential killers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the potential killers, we need to determine which members of the mafia do not appear as a reporting target for any other member. We can achieve this by:
   - Creating a list to track how many members report to each member.
   - Iterating through the reporting list to populate this tracking list.
   - Finally, we will collect the indices of members who have a count of zero in the tracking list, as these members are not reported to by anyone.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a list 'report_count' of size N+1 with all zeros
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If Ri is not 0:
           Increment report_count[Ri] by 1
   Initialize an empty list 'potential_killers'
   For each member i from 1 to N:
       If report_count[i] is 0:
           Append i to potential_killers
   Sort potential_killers
   Print the elements of potential_killers as space-separated integers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python

    # Read the number of members
    N = int(input())
    # Read the reporting structure
    R = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize a list to count how many people report to each member
    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)
    
    # Count the number of reports for each member
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        Ri = R[i - 1]  # R is 0-indexed, members are 1-indexed
        if Ri != 0:
            report_count[Ri] += 1
    
    # Find all members who are not reported to by anyone
    potential_killers = []
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        if report_count[i] == 0:

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof at the origin (0, 0) based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). 

    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.

    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum. The approach was straightforward and worked well within the constraints provided. 

    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently handling input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. The solution utilized a linear search for counting walls, which was acceptable given the constraints, but could be optimized further with binary search if necessary. Overall, the solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls
            index += 1
        
            walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions
            index += 1
        
            Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                x_j, y_j = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read query coordinates
                index += 1
            
                sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
                # Check if the point lies on any wall
                if sum_xy in walls:
                    results.append(-1)
                else:
                    # Count how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                    count = 0
                    for wall in walls:
                        if wall > sum_xy:
                            count += 1

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective attendance frequencies. The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.

    The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.

    Key code snippets included:
    ```python
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            temp = b
            b = a % b
            a = temp
        return a

    def lcm(a, b):
        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):
        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)

    def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):
        total_hours = N * 24
        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)
        return total_hours // lcm_value
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.

    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.

    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q
            index += 1
        
            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills
            index += 1
        
            # Create a prefix sum array
            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)
        
            # Fill the prefix sum array
            for i in range(1, N + 1):
                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]
        
            # Process each query
            for __ in range(Q):
                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query
                index += 1
            
                # Calculate the sum from X to Y
                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]
                results.append(result)  # Store the result
    
        # Print all results for all queries
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    # Call the solve function to execute the code
    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves identifying potential killers in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and the Don (the leader) reports to no one (indicated by a reporting value of 0). A potential killer is defined as a member who no one reports to, meaning they are not reported to by any other member. The task is to find and list these potential killers in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to determine which members are not reported to by anyone. We can achieve this by creating a list to track how many members report to each member. We will iterate through the reporting list and increment the count for each member that is reported to. After processing the reporting structure, we will check which members have a count of zero (indicating that no one reports to them) and collect their indices. Finally, we will sort these indices and print them.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_potential_killers(N, reporting):
       Initialize a list `report_count` of size N+1 with all zeros
       
       for i from 1 to N:
           R = reporting[i-1]  // Get the reporting value for member i
           if R is not 0:
               Increment report_count[R] by 1  // Increment the count for the member reported to

       Initialize an empty list `potential_killers`
       for i from 1 to N:
           if report_count[i] is 0:
               Append i to potential_killers  // This member is not reported to by anyone

       Sort potential_killers
       return potential_killers
   ```

Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and the Don (the leader) reports to no one (indicated by a reporting value of 0). A potential killer is defined as a member who no one reports to, meaning they are not reported to by any other member. The task is to find and list these potential killers in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to determine which members are not reported to by anyone. We can achieve this by creating a list to track how many members report to each member. We will iterate through the reporting list and increment the count for each member that is reported to. After processing the reporting structure, we will check which members have a count of zero (indicating that no one reports to them) and collect their indices. Finally, we will sort these indices and print them.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_potential_killers(N, reporting):
       Initialize a list `report_count` of size N+1 with all zeros
       
       for i from 1 to N:
           R = reporting[i-1]  // Get the reporting value for member i
           if R is not 0:
               Increment report_count[R] by 1  // Increment the count for the member reported to

       Initialize an empty list `potential_killers`
       for i from 1 to N:
           if report_count[i] is 0:
               Append i to potential_killers  // This member is not reported to by anyone

       Sort potential_killers
       return potential_killers
   ```

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef is a private detective. He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.
Chef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.
There are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.
Now, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.

-----Input-----
The first line of input contains one integer N.
Next line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri â€” the person whom the ith member reports to.

-----Output-----
Output a list of space-separated integers in ascending order â€” the indices of potential killers.

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to identify potential killers in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. The key concept was to determine which members were not reported to by anyone, indicating they were "minor criminals." The solution involved counting how many members reported to each member and then identifying those with a count of zero.

The approach was straightforward: 
1. Initialize a list to track the number of reports for each member.
2. Iterate through the reporting list to populate this count.
3. Collect members with a count of zero into a separate list.
4. Sort and output this list.

The implementation was successful, and the code efficiently handled the constraints provided (up to 100,000 members). The final solution was structured to read input, process the reporting structure, and output the potential killers in ascending order.

Key code snippet:
```python
def find_potential_killers(N, reporting):
    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        R = reporting[i - 1]
        if R != 0:
            report_count[R] += 1
    potential_killers = [i for i in range(1, N + 1) if report_count[i] == 0]
    potential_killers.sort()
    return potential_killers
```

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding hierarchical structures and efficiently counting relationships, which is a common pattern in problems involving trees or graphs.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:

    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
n = eval(input())
r = list(map(int, input().split()))

tree = dict()
i = 1
for j in r:
 c = tree.get(j)
 if c:
  tree[j].append(i)
 else:
  tree[j] = [i]
 if not tree.get(i):
  tree[i] = []
 i += 1
s = []
for elem in tree:
 if not tree[elem]:
  s.append(str(elem))
print(' '.join(s))

INFO - [Task id] 1188 [generation text] The official solution takes a different approach by using a dictionary to represent the reporting structure, which allows for a more intuitive mapping of members to their reports. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Data Structure**: The solution uses a dictionary (`tree`) to map each member to a list of members that report to them. This is a more flexible structure compared to a simple list, as it allows for easy addition and retrieval of members.

2. **Building the Reporting Structure**: The solution iterates through the reporting list and populates the dictionary. For each member, it checks if they already have a list of reporters; if not, it initializes an empty list. This ensures that every member is accounted for, even if they have no reports.

3. **Identifying Potential Killers**: After constructing the reporting structure, the solution checks each member in the dictionary. If a member's list of reporters is empty, they are added to the list of potential killers. This is a straightforward way to determine which members are not reported to by anyone.

4. **Output**: Finally, the solution formats the output by joining the list of potential killers into a space-separated string.

The official solution is efficient and clear, leveraging the dictionary's capabilities to handle the relationships dynamically. My initial approach was also valid but used a list to count reports, which is less intuitive for this specific problem. The dictionary method provides a clearer representation of the relationships and simplifies the identification of potential killers. 

In future problems, considering the use of dictionaries for mapping relationships could lead to more elegant and efficient solutions.
