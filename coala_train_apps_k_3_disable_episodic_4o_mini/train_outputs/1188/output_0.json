    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves identifying potential killers in a mafia organization based on a reporting structure. Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and the Don (the leader) reports to no one (indicated by a reporting value of 0). A potential killer is defined as a member who no one reports to, meaning they are not reported to by any other member. The task is to find and list these potential killers in ascending order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we need to determine which members are not reported to by anyone. We can achieve this by creating a list to track how many members report to each member. We will iterate through the reporting list and increment the count for each member that is reported to. After processing the reporting structure, we will check which members have a count of zero (indicating that no one reports to them) and collect their indices. Finally, we will sort these indices and print them.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_potential_killers(N, reporting):\n       Initialize a list `report_count` of size N+1 with all zeros\n       \n       for i from 1 to N:\n           R = reporting[i-1]  // Get the reporting value for member i\n           if R is not 0:\n               Increment report_count[R] by 1  // Increment the count for the member reported to\n\n       Initialize an empty list `potential_killers`\n       for i from 1 to N:\n           if report_count[i] is 0:\n               Append i to potential_killers  // This member is not reported to by anyone\n\n       Sort potential_killers\n       return potential_killers\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers(N, reporting):\n    # Initialize a list to count how many members report to each member\n    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)\n    \n    # Count the number of reports for each member\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        R = reporting[i - 1]  # Get the reporting value for member i\n        if R != 0:\n            report_count[R] += 1  # Increment the count for the member reported to\n\n    # List to hold potential killers (members nobody reports to)\n    potential_killers = []\n    \n    # Identify members who are not reported to by anyone\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if report_count[i] == 0:\n            potential_killers.append(i)  # This member is not reported to by anyone\n\n    # Sort the list of potential killers\n    potential_killers.sort()\n    \n    # Return the list of potential killers\n    return potential_killers\n\n# Read input\nN = int(input())\nreporting = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Find potential killers and print them\nresult = find_potential_killers(N, reporting)\nprint(\" \".join(map(str, result)))\n```",
