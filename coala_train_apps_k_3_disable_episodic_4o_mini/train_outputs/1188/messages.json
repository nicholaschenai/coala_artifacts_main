He was asked to investigate a case of murder in the city of Frangton.\nChef arrived in Frangton to find out that the mafia was involved in the case. Chef spent some time watching for people that belong to the clan and was able to build a map of relationships between them. He knows that a mafia's organizational structure consists of a single Don, heading a hierarchical criminal organization. Each member reports exactly to one other member of the clan. It's obvious that there are no cycles in the reporting system of the mafia.\nThere are N people in the clan, for simplicity indexed from 1 to N, and Chef knows who each of them report to. Member i reports to member Ri.\nNow, Chef needs to identfy all potential killers to continue his investigation. Having considerable knowledge about the mafia's activities, Chef knows that the killer must be a minor criminal, that is, one of the members who nobody reports to. Please find the list of potential killers for Chef. Since Don reports to nobody, his Ri will be equal to 0.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of input contains one integer N.\nNext line has N space-separated integers, the ith integer denotes Ri \u2014 the person whom the ith member reports to.\n\n-----Output-----\nOutput a list of space-separated integers in ascending order \u2014 the indices of potential killers.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 105\n- 1 \u2264 Ri \u2264 N except for Don, whose Ri equals to 0.\n- It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the reporting structure.\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask #1 [50 points]: N \u2264 10000\n- Subtask #2 [50 points]: No additional constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n6\n0 1 1 2 2 3\n\nOutput:\n4 5 6\n\n-----Explanation-----\nThe reporting structure:\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each member of the mafia reports to another member, and there is a single Don who reports to no one (indicated by a reporting value of 0). The task is to identify the members of the mafia who are not reported to by anyone else, as these members are considered potential killers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To find the potential killers, we need to determine which members of the mafia do not appear as a reporting target for any other member. We can achieve this by:\n   - Creating a list to track how many members report to each member.\n   - Iterating through the reporting list to populate this tracking list.\n   - Finally, we will collect the indices of members who have a count of zero in the tracking list, as these members are not reported to by anyone.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize a list 'report_count' of size N+1 with all zeros\n   For each member i from 1 to N:\n       If Ri is not 0:\n           Increment report_count[Ri] by 1\n   Initialize an empty list 'potential_killers'\n   For each member i from 1 to N:\n       If report_count[i] is 0:\n           Append i to potential_killers\n   Sort potential_killers\n   Print the elements of potential_killers as space-separated integers\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef find_potential_killers():\n    # Read the number of members\n    N = int(input())\n    # Read the reporting structure\n    R = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Initialize a list to count how many people report to each member\n    report_count = [0] * (N + 1)\n    \n    # Count the number of reports for each member\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        Ri = R[i - 1]  # R is 0-indexed, members are 1-indexed\n        if Ri != 0:\n            report_count[Ri] += 1\n    \n    # Find all members who are not reported to by anyone\n    potential_killers = []\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if report_count[i] == 0:\n            potential_killers.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the potential killers\n    potential_killers.sort()\n    \n    # Print the result as space-separated integers\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, potential_killers)))\n\n```"

The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). \n\n    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.\n\n    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum. The approach was straightforward and worked well within the constraints provided. \n\n    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently handling input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. The solution utilized a linear search for counting walls, which was acceptable given the constraints, but could be optimized further with binary search if necessary. Overall, the solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls\n            index += 1\n        \n            walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions\n            index += 1\n        \n            Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                x_j, y_j = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read query coordinates\n                index += 1\n            \n                sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                # Check if the point lies on any wall\n                if sum_xy in walls:\n                    results.append(-1)\n                else:\n                    # Count how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                    count = 0\n                    for wall in walls:\n                        if wall > sum_xy:\n                            count += 1\n                    results.append(count)\n    \n        # Print all results for all queries\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    # Call the solve function to execute the code\n    solve()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies employed, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine how many times first, second, and third-year students would all be present on campus together over a specified number of days, given their respective attendance frequencies. The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.\n\n    The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.\n\n    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.\n\n    Key code snippets included:\n    ```python\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            temp = b\n            b = a % b\n            a = temp\n        return a\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\n    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):\n        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)\n\n    def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):\n        total_hours = N * 24\n        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        return total_hours // lcm_value\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.\n\n    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.\n\n    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q\n            index += 1\n        \n            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills\n            index += 1\n        \n            # Create a prefix sum array\n            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)\n        \n            # Fill the prefix sum array\n            for i in range(1, N + 1):\n                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]\n        \n            # Process each query\n            for __ in range(Q):\n                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query\n                index += 1\n            \n                # Calculate the sum from X to Y\n                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]\n                results.append(result)  # Store the result\n    \n        # Print all results for all queries\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    # Call the solve function to execute the code\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is a more flexible structure compared to a simple list, as it allows for easy addition and retrieval of members.\n\n2. **Building the Reporting Structure**: The solution iterates through the reporting list and populates the dictionary.

This ensures that every member is accounted for, even if they have no reports.\n\n3. **Identifying Potential Killers**: After constructing the reporting structure, the solution checks each member in the dictionary.
