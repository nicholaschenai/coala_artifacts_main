    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Chef wants to create a schedule for his restaurant that serves one of four Ukrainian dishes each day. The schedule must ensure that no two consecutive days serve the same dish, and the first and last days must also serve different dishes. The task is to calculate how many valid schedules can be created for a given number of days, N, and return the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can use combinatorial reasoning. For the first day, we have 4 choices (one for each dish). For each subsequent day, we have 3 choices (since we cannot serve the same dish as the previous day). However, we need to ensure that the last day is different from the first day. This can be handled by calculating the total arrangements and then adjusting for the constraint on the last day.\n\n   The formula can be derived as follows:\n   - For the first day, we have 4 options.\n   - For the next \\(N-2\\) days, we have 3 options each day.\n   - For the last day, we have 3 options (it must be different from the dish served on the first day).\n\n   Thus, the total number of valid schedules can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total schedules} = 4 \\times 3^{(N-1)}\n   \\]\n   However, since the last day must be different from the first, we need to multiply by 3 again for the last day, leading to:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total schedules} = 4 \\times 3^{(N-1)} \\times 3 = 4 \\times 3^N\n   \\]\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_schedules(N):\n       MOD = 10^9 + 7\n       if N == 1:\n           return 4\n       else:\n           return (4 * (3^N) % MOD) % MOD\n\n   function main():\n       T = read number of test cases\n       for each test case:\n           N = read number of days\n           result = calculate_schedules(N)\n           print(result)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef power(base, exp, mod):\n    # Function to calculate (base^exp) % mod using iterative method\n    result = 1\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:  # If exp is odd\n            result = (result * base) % mod\n        base = (base * base) % mod  # Square the base\n        exp //= 2  # Divide exp by 2\n    return result\n\ndef calculate_schedules(N):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    if N == 1:\n        return 4  # Only one day, 4 choices\n    else:\n        # Total schedules = 4 * (3^N) % MOD\n        return (4 * power(3, N, MOD)) % MOD\n\ndef main():\n    T = int(input())  # Read number of test cases\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input())  # Read number of days for each test case\n        result = calculate_schedules(N)  # Calculate the number of schedules\n        print(result)  # Output the result\n\nmain()\n```",
