This data structure holds information about array of N elements and can process two types of operations:\n\n- Add some value to ith element of the array\n- Calculate sum of all elements on any prefix of the array\n\nBoth operations take O(log N) time. This data structure is also well known for its low memory usage. To be more precise, it needs exactly the same amount of memory as that of array.\n\nGiven some array A, first we build data structure in some other array T. Ti stores the sum of the elements Astart, Astart + 1, ..., Ai. Index start is calculated with formula start = Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1)). Here \"&\" denotes bitwise AND operation.\nSo, in order to find a sum of elements A0, A1, ..., AL you start with index L and calculate sum of TL + TFdown(L)-1 + TFdown(Fdown(L)-1)-1 + ... + TFdown(Fdown(...(Fdown(L)-1)-1)-1. Usually it is performed with cycle that goes from L down to 0 with function Fdown and sums some elements from T. Chef wants to verify that the time complexity to calculate sum of A0, A1, A2, ..., AL is O(log L). In order to do so, he wonders how many times he has to access array T to calculate this sum. Help him to find this out.\nSince Chef works with really big indices. The value of L can be very large and is provided to you in binary representation as concatenation of strings L1, L2 repeated N times and string L3.\n\n-----Input-----\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains three non-empty strings L1, L2, L3 and an integer N. Strings will contain only characters 0 and 1. To obtain binary representation of index L concatenate L1 with L2 repeated N times and with L3. You are guaranteed that the index will be positive.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, output a single line containing number of times Fenwick tree data structure will access array T in order to compute sum of A0, A1, A2, ..., AL.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- 1 \u2264 T \u2264 300\n- 1 \u2264 Length(Li) \u2264 1000\n- 1 \u2264 N \u2264 106\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask #1 (20 points): |L1| + |L2| * N + |L3| \u2264 60\n- Subtask #2 (30 points): 1 \u2264 T \u2264 30, 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n- Subtask #3 (50 points): No additional constraints\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n4\n001 100 011 4\n1000 1101 100 3\n1010 001 101 4\n010 101 000 4\n\nOutput:\n6\n12\n8\n10\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The index L is constructed by concatenating three binary strings, where the second string is repeated N times. The goal is to determine the number of accesses to the array T for each test case.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve the problem, we need to:\n   - Construct the binary representation of L by concatenating L1, L2 repeated N times, and L3.\n   - Convert this binary string into an integer to get the value of L.\n   - Calculate how many times we need to access the array T to compute the sum of elements from A0 to AL using the Fenwick tree properties. This involves repeatedly applying the function Fdown, which is defined as `Fdown(i) = (i & (i + 1))`, until we reach 0. Each application of Fdown corresponds to one access to the array T.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_accesses(L1, L2, L3, N):\n       # Step 1: Construct the binary string L\n       L = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3\n       \n       # Step 2: Convert binary string L to an integer\n       L_value = convert_binary_to_integer(L)\n       \n       # Step 3: Initialize access count\n       access_count = 0\n       \n       # Step 4: Calculate the number of accesses using Fdown\n       while L_value > 0:\n           access_count += 1\n           L_value = Fdown(L_value)\n       \n       return access_count\n\n   function Fdown(i):\n       return (i & (i + 1))\n\n   main:\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read L1, L2, L3, N\n           result = count_accesses(L1, L2, L3, N)\n           print(result)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef Fdown(i):\n    return (i & (i + 1))\n\ndef count_accesses(L1, L2, L3, N):\n    # Step 1: Construct the binary string L\n    L = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3\n    \n    # Step 2: Convert binary string L to an integer\n    L_value = int(L, 2)\n    \n    # Step 3: Initialize access count\n    access_count = 0\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the number of accesses using Fdown\n    while L_value > 0:\n        access_count += 1\n        L_value = Fdown(L_value)\n    \n    return access_count\n\n# Main function to read input and output results\nT = int(input())\nfor _ in range(T):\n    L1, L2, L3, N = input().split()\n    N = int(N)\n    result = count_accesses(L1, L2, L3, N)\n    print(result)\n```"

The key concept was to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the three frequencies to find the interval at which all groups would be present simultaneously.\n\n    The solution involved defining helper functions for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM, and then using these to compute the total number of hours in `N` days. The final count of simultaneous attendance was derived by dividing the total hours by the LCM of the attendance frequencies.\n\n    The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output requirements. The code was structured to read multiple test cases and output results accordingly. The approach was efficient, leveraging mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to ensure performance even with large input sizes.\n\n    Key code snippets included:\n    ```python\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b != 0:\n            temp = b\n            b = a % b\n            a = temp\n        return a\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)\n\n    def lcm_of_three(x, y, z):\n        return lcm(lcm(x, y), z)\n\n    def count_audience_days(N, x, y, z):\n        total_hours = N * 24\n        lcm_value = lcm_of_three(x, y, z)\n        return total_hours // lcm_value\n    ```\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding mathematical concepts like LCM and GCD in solving problems related to periodic events. The solution was efficient and met the problem's constraints effectively.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.\n\n    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.\n\n    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q\n            index += 1\n        \n            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills\n            index += 1\n        \n            # Create a prefix sum array\n            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)\n        \n            # Fill the prefix sum array\n            for i in range(1, N + 1):\n                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]\n        \n            # Process each query\n            for __ in range(Q):\n                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query\n                index += 1\n            \n                # Calculate the sum from X to Y\n                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]\n                results.append(result)  # Store the result\n    \n        # Print all results for all queries\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    # Call the solve function to execute the code\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code might be going wrong.\n\n1. **Understanding the Fdown Function**:\n   The function `Fdown(i)` is defined as `i & (i + 1)`. This function is used to determine the next index to access in the Fenwick tree. The way we are using it in the `count_accesses` function is correct, but we need to ensure that we are correctly decrementing `L` before applying `Fdown`.\n\n2. **Counting Accesses**:\n   The logic for counting accesses is to repeatedly apply `Fdown` until we reach 0. However, the way we are decrementing `L` before calling `Fdown` might be incorrect. The decrement should happen after we check if `L` is greater than 0, and we should be careful about how we handle the decrement.\n\n3. **Binary to Decimal Conversion**:\n   The conversion from binary to decimal using `int(L, 2)` is correct. However, we need to ensure that the constructed binary string `L` is accurate and reflects the expected value.\n\n4. **Expected Output**:\n   The expected output for the test cases indicates that the number of accesses is higher than what our code is producing. This suggests that we might not be counting all the necessary accesses correctly.\n\n### Where I Went Wrong:\n- The decrement of `L` before applying `Fdown` might be causing us to miss some accesses. We should be applying `Fdown` directly to `L` without decrementing it first.\n- The logic for counting accesses should ensure that we are correctly counting every time we access the array `T`.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. Construct the binary string `L` correctly.\n2. Convert `L` to a decimal integer.\n3. Count the accesses by applying `Fdown` directly to `L` until `L` becomes 0, without decrementing `L` beforehand.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.\n\n```python\ndef Fdown(i):\n    # Function to calculate Fdown(i) = i & (i + 1)\n    return (i & (i + 1))\n\ndef count_accesses(L):\n    # Function to count the number of accesses to T to compute sum up to A[L]\n    count = 0\n    while L > 0:\n        L = Fdown(L)  # Update L using Fdown without decrementing\n        count += 1  # Increment the access count\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        L1, L2, L3, N = data[i].split()  # Read each test case\n        N = int(N)  # Convert N to integer\n        \n        # Construct the binary representation of L\n        L = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3\n        \n        # Convert binary string L to decimal integer\n        L_decimal = int(L, 2)\n        \n        # Count the number of accesses to T\n        accesses = count_accesses(L_decimal)\n        \n        # Store the result\n        results.append(accesses)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the code\nsolve()\n``` \n\nThis revised code should correctly count the number of accesses to the Fenwick tree for each test case."

The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). \n\n    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.\n\n    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum.

        "content": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step to identify the issues in the current implementation:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   The goal is to count how many times we access the Fenwick tree's internal array `T` when calculating the sum of elements from `A[0]` to `A[L]`. The index `L` is constructed from three binary strings, and we need to ensure that the counting logic is correct.\n\n2. **Reviewing the `count_accesses` Function**:\n   The `count_accesses` function is designed to count the number of accesses by repeatedly applying the `Fdown` function. However, the logic for how we are applying `Fdown` might not be correct. The function should be applied to `L - 1` instead of `L` to correctly simulate the access pattern of the Fenwick tree.\n\n3. **Potential Infinite Loop**:\n   If `L` is not being decremented correctly, it could lead to an infinite loop or excessive iterations, which might be causing the runtime error or time limit exceeded error. We need to ensure that we are decrementing `L` properly before applying `Fdown`.\n\n4. **Binary String Construction**:\n   The construction of the binary string `L` seems correct, but we need to ensure that the resulting binary string is accurately converted to a decimal integer.\n\n### Where I Went Wrong:\n- The `count_accesses` function should apply `Fdown` to `L - 1` instead of `L` to correctly simulate the Fenwick tree's access pattern.\n- The loop condition and decrementing logic need to be carefully handled to avoid infinite loops.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. Construct the binary string `L` correctly.\n2. Convert `L` to a decimal integer.\n3. Count the accesses by applying `Fdown` to `L - 1` until we reach 0.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.\n\n```python\ndef Fdown(i):\n    # Function to calculate Fdown(i) = i & (i + 1)\n    return (i & (i + 1))\n\ndef count_accesses(L):\n    # Function to count the number of accesses to T to compute sum up to A[L]\n    count = 0\n    while L > 0:\n        L = Fdown(L - 1)  # Update L using Fdown after decrementing\n        count += 1  # Increment the access count\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        L1, L2, L3, N = data[i].split()  # Read each test case\n        N = int(N)  # Convert N to integer\n        \n        # Construct the binary representation of L\n        L = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3\n        \n        # Convert binary string L to decimal integer\n        L_decimal = int(L, 2)\n        \n        # Count the number of accesses to T\n        accesses = count_accesses(L_decimal)\n        \n        # Store the result\n        results.append(accesses)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the code\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- The `count_accesses` function now applies `Fdown` to `L - 1` to correctly simulate the access pattern of the Fenwick tree.\n- This should resolve any potential infinite loops and ensure that the counting logic is accurate.\n\nThis code should now correctly compute the number of accesses for each test case as specified in the problem statement."

        "content": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step to identify the issues in the current implementation:\n\n1. **Understanding the Access Counting Logic**:\n   The goal is to count how many times we access the Fenwick tree's internal array `T` when calculating the sum of elements from `A[0]` to `A[L]`. The access pattern is determined by repeatedly applying the `Fdown` function, which is defined as `Fdown(i) = i & (i + 1)`.\n\n2. **Reviewing the `count_accesses` Function**:\n   The current implementation of `count_accesses` applies `Fdown` to `L - 1`, which is incorrect. The Fenwick tree accesses should be based on `L` itself, not `L - 1`. The correct approach is to start with `L` and apply `Fdown` until we reach 0.\n\n3. **Counting Logic**:\n   The counting logic should be:\n   - Start with `L`.\n   - While `L` is greater than 0, apply `Fdown` to `L` and increment the count.\n   - This will correctly simulate the number of accesses needed to compute the sum.\n\n4. **Binary String Construction**:\n   The construction of the binary string `L` seems correct, but we need to ensure that the resulting binary string is accurately converted to a decimal integer.\n\n### Where I Went Wrong:\n- The `count_accesses` function should apply `Fdown` directly to `L` instead of `L - 1`. This is the main source of the incorrect access counts.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. Construct the binary string `L` correctly.\n2. Convert `L` to a decimal integer.\n3. Count the accesses by applying `Fdown` to `L` until we reach 0.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected logic in the code.\n\n```python\ndef Fdown(i):\n    # Function to calculate Fdown(i) = i & (i + 1)\n    return (i & (i + 1))\n\ndef count_accesses(L):\n    # Function to count the number of accesses to T to compute sum up to A[L]\n    count = 0\n    while L > 0:\n        L = Fdown(L)  # Update L using Fdown directly\n        count += 1  # Increment the access count\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        L1, L2, L3, N = data[i].split()  # Read each test case\n        N = int(N)  # Convert N to integer\n        \n        # Construct the binary representation of L\n        L = L1 + (L2 * N) + L3\n        \n        # Convert binary string L to decimal integer\n        L_decimal = int(L, 2)\n        \n        # Count the number of accesses to T\n        accesses = count_accesses(L_decimal)\n        \n        # Store the result\n        results.append(accesses)\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the code\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n- The `count_accesses` function now applies `Fdown` directly to `L` instead of `L - 1`, ensuring that we correctly simulate the access pattern of the Fenwick tree.\n- This should resolve the incorrect access counts and ensure that the counting logic is accurate.\n\nThis code should now correctly compute the number of accesses for each test case as specified in the problem statement."

The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). \n\n    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.\n\n    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum. The approach was straightforward and worked well within the constraints provided. \n\n    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently handling input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. The solution utilized a linear search for counting walls, which was acceptable given the constraints, but could be optimized further with binary search if necessary. Overall, the solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls\n            index += 1\n        \n            walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions\n            index += 1\n        \n            Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                x_j, y_j = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read query coordinates\n                index += 1\n            \n                sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                # Check if the point lies on any wall\n                if sum_xy in walls:\n                    results.append(-1)\n                else:\n                    # Count how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                    count = 0\n                    for wall in walls:\n                        if wall > sum_xy:\n                            count += 1\n                    results.append(count)\n    \n        # Print all results for all queries\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    # Call the solve function to execute the code\n    solve()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies employed, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.\n\n    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.\n\n    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python. Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and Q\n            index += 1\n        \n            bills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the bills\n            index += 1\n        \n            # Create a prefix sum array\n            prefix_sum = [0] * (N + 1)\n        \n            # Fill the prefix sum array\n            for i in range(1, N + 1):\n                prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + bills[i - 1]\n        \n            # Process each query\n            for __ in range(Q):\n                X, Y = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read the query\n                index += 1\n            \n                # Calculate the sum from X to Y\n                result = prefix_sum[Y] - prefix_sum[X - 1]\n                results.append(result)  # Store the result\n    \n        # Print all results for all queries\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    # Call the solve function to execute the code\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful input/output handling and the efficiency of using prefix sums for range queries.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

However, my implementation had a critical flaw in how I applied the `Fdown` function. I mistakenly decremented `L` before applying `Fdown`, which led to incorrect access counts and ultimately failed to pass the test cases.\n\nThe official solution provided a more straightforward approach. It constructs the binary representation of `L` directly by concatenating the strings and converting the result to a decimal integer in one step. The key insight from the official solution is the use of the expression `d = (d & (d + 1)) - 1`, which effectively simulates the access pattern of the Fenwick tree without the need for decrementing `d` beforehand. This approach ensures that the number of accesses is counted correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the official solution efficiently handles input and output, storing results in a list and printing them in a single loop at the end. This is a good practice for performance, especially when dealing with multiple test cases.\n\nIn summary, the main takeaway is to ensure that the logic for accessing the Fenwick tree is implemented correctly and to streamline the input/output process for better performance. The official solution's approach to constructing `L` and counting accesses is a valuable reference for similar problems in the future."
