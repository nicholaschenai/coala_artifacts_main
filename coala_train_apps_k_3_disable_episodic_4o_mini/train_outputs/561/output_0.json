    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves determining if Gru can distribute a certain amount of money to a group of minions such that he ends up with exactly zero money left. Each minion has a specific amount of money they demand, and Gru can only give money if the demand is less than or equal to what he has at that moment.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   For each test case, we need to check if the total amount of money demanded by all minions equals the amount of money Gru has. If the total demand is less than or equal to the money Gru has, then he can distribute the money accordingly. If the total demand exceeds the money Gru has, then it is impossible for him to distribute the money as required.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N and K\n           read the list of demands A\n           total_demand = sum of A\n           if total_demand == K:\n               print \"YES\"\n           else:\n               print \"NO\"\n\n   read T\n   test_cases = []\n   for i from 1 to T:\n       read N and K\n       read demands A\n       append (N, K, A) to test_cases\n   can_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Extract number of minions and amount of money Gru has\n        A = case[2]  # Extract the list of demands from minions\n        \n        total_demand = sum(A)  # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by minions\n        \n        # Check if the total demand equals the money Gru has\n        if total_demand == K:\n            print(\"YES\")  # Gru can distribute the money exactly\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")  # Gru cannot distribute the money as required\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())  # Read N and K\n    A = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the demands\n    test_cases.append((N, K, A))  # Store the test case\n\n# Call the function to process the test cases\ncan_distribute_money(T, test_cases)\n```",
