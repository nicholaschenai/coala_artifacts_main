    "raw_msg": "Here is the corrected Python code that addresses the problem of determining if all players in a tennis tournament can win the same number of matches and generates the appropriate output format:\n\n```python\ndef solve_tournament(T, test_cases):\n    for N in test_cases:\n        if N % 2 == 0:  # Check if N is even\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            # Create an N x N matrix initialized with '0'\n            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]\n            for i in range(N):\n                # Each player i wins against player (i + 1) % N\n                matrix[i][(i + 1) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against the next player\n                matrix[(i + 1) % N][i] = '0'  # The next player loses to player i\n            for row in matrix:\n                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    test_cases.append(N)\n\nsolve_tournament(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Input Handling**: The code first reads the number of test cases \\( T \\) and then reads \\( N \\) for each test case, storing them in a list.\n2. **Tournament Logic**:\n   - If \\( N \\) is even, it prints \"NO\" since it's impossible for all players to win the same number of matches.\n   - If \\( N \\) is odd, it prints \"YES\" and constructs a win/loss matrix.\n3. **Matrix Construction**:\n   - The matrix is initialized with '0's.\n   - Each player \\( i \\) wins against the next player in a circular manner, ensuring that each player wins exactly one match and loses exactly one match.\n4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the matrix row by row, converting each row list to a string.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem and pass all tests.",
