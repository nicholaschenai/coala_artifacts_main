    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves a tennis tournament where each player competes against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties. The goal is to determine if it's possible for all players to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we need to provide a representation of the match outcomes in a specific format.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we need to recognize that if there are an even number of players (N), it is impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because each player would have to win and lose an equal number of matches, which is not feasible. However, if N is odd, we can create a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly one match against one player and loses against another, ensuring that the wins are evenly distributed. We can represent the results in a matrix format where each row corresponds to a player and each column indicates whether that player won against another player.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function solve_tournament(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           N = test_case\n           if N is even:\n               print \"NO\"\n           else:\n               print \"YES\"\n               create an N x N matrix initialized with '0'\n               for i from 0 to N-1:\n                   for j from 1 to N-1:\n                       if j != i:\n                           matrix[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  // player i wins against player (i + j) % N\n               for each row in matrix:\n                   print row as a string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef solve_tournament(T, test_cases):\n    for N in test_cases:\n        if N % 2 == 0:  # Check if N is even\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            # Create an N x N matrix initialized with '0'\n            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]\n            for i in range(N):\n                for j in range(1, N):  # Each player wins against one player\n                    if j != i:\n                        matrix[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against (i + j) % N\n            for row in matrix:\n                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    test_cases.append(N)\n\nsolve_tournament(T, test_cases)\n```",
