## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine if it's possible for a group of players in a tennis tournament to each win the same number of matches when every player plays against every other player exactly once. If it's possible, we also need to provide a representation of the match outcomes in a specific format.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - If the number of players \( N \) is odd, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because each player would have to win \( (N-1)/2 \) matches, which is not an integer. Thus, we would output "NO".
   - If \( N \) is even, we can create a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly \( N/2 \) matches. We can achieve this by having players win against the next \( N/2 \) players in a circular manner. For example, player 1 beats players 2 to \( N/2 + 1 \), player 2 beats players 3 to \( N/2 + 2 \), and so on, wrapping around when necessary.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           if N is odd:
               print "NO"
           else:
               print "YES"
               create a 2D list results of size N x N initialized with '0'
               for i from 0 to N-1:
                   for j from 1 to N/2:
                       results[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'  // player i wins against player (i + j) % N
               for each row in results:
                   print row as a string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 != 0:  # Check if N is odd
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            results = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]  # Create a 2D list initialized with '0'

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.

    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \( A[i] \) by its index \( i \) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:

    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is "YES". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is "NO". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \( N \) natural numbers.

    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \( N(N + 1)/2 \). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.

    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is zero.
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
       - Returning "NO" otherwise.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
        
            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, A))

    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning "YES" or "NO".
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_contests(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.

   The problem involves a tennis tournament where each player competes against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves a tennis tournament where each player competes against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties. The goal is to determine if it's possible for all players to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we need to provide a representation of the match outcomes in a specific format.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to recognize that if there are an even number of players (N), it is impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because each player would have to win and lose an equal number of matches, which is not feasible. However, if N is odd, we can create a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly one match against one player and loses against another, ensuring that the wins are evenly distributed. We can represent the results in a matrix format where each row corresponds to a player and each column indicates whether that player won against another player.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to create a tournament where each player wins the same number of matches. If the number of players \( N \) is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches, so we should output "NO". If \( N \) is odd, we need to construct a valid win/loss matrix.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   In the previous solution, the logic for filling the matrix was incorrect. The way I was determining the winners was flawed. Specifically, the line:
   ```python
   matrix[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'
   ```
   does not ensure that each player wins exactly one match and loses exactly one match. Instead, it creates a situation where some players may end up winning more than one match or having contradictory results.

3. **Correcting the Logic**:
   For an odd number of players, we can use a round-robin approach where each player beats the next player in a circular manner. For example, player 0 beats player 1, player 1 beats player 2, and so on, with the last player beating the first player. This ensures that each player wins exactly one match and loses exactly one match.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   I will revise the code to correctly implement this logic. Each player will win against the next player in a circular manner, and the matrix will be filled accordingly.

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 == 0:  # Check if N is even
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Create an N x N matrix initialized with '0'
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                # Each player i wins against player (i + 1) % N
                matrix[i][(i + 1) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against the next player
                matrix[(i + 1) % N][i] = '0'  # The next player loses to player i
            for row in matrix:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

solve_tournament(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- The matrix is filled such that each player wins against the next player in a circular manner.
- The output format is maintained as required, ensuring that each player has exactly one win and one loss. 

This should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem.

### Key Changes:
- The matrix is filled such that each player wins against the next player in a circular manner.
- The output format is maintained as required, ensuring that each player has exactly one win and one loss. 

This should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of alternating '1's and '0's based on an integer input \( K \) for multiple test cases. The pattern required printing \( K \) lines for each test case, where each line \( i \) contains \( i \) characters.

    The solution involved iterating through each test case and constructing the required lines by checking the index of each character to determine whether to append '1' or '0'. The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided.

    One key aspect was ensuring that the output format matched the expected results, which involved printing each line immediately after constructing it. The solution was efficient and adhered to the problem's requirements without any external libraries.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
        for K in test_cases:
            for i in range(1, K + 1):
                line = ""
                for j in range(i):
                    if j % 2 == 0:
                        line += "1"
                    else:
                        line += "0"
                print(line)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]
    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing output formatting and the utility of nested loops for generating patterns based on incremental conditions.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input \( K \) for multiple test cases. The expected output required alternating lines of numbers, where even-indexed lines counted up from `0` to the line index, and odd-indexed lines counted down from the line index to `0`.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Pattern Recognition**: The output pattern alternates between counting up and counting down based on the line index. This was a crucial aspect that needed to be correctly implemented to match the expected output.
    2. **Logic Implementation**: The initial attempts incorrectly generated lines by not adhering to the specified counting logic. The correct approach involved checking if the line index was even or odd and generating the line accordingly.

    ### Code Snippet:
    The final corrected code that adheres to the requirements is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
        for K in test_cases:
            for i in range(K):
                line = ""
                if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index: count up from 0 to i
                    for j in range(i + 1):
                        line += str(j)
                else:  # Odd index: count down from i to 0
                    for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                        line += str(j)
                print(line)

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]
    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
    ```

    ### Lessons Learned:
    - It is essential to carefully analyze the output requirements and ensure that the logic implemented matches those requirements.
    - Alternating patterns can often lead to confusion; clear separation of logic for different cases (even vs. odd) is necessary to avoid errors.
    - Testing with various inputs can help identify edge cases and ensure the robustness of the solution.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.

    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----
- 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
- 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

-----Sample Input:-----
2
3
2

-----Sample Output:-----
YES
010
001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

1. Restate the problem in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves a tennis tournament where each player competes against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties. The goal is to determine if it's possible for all players to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we need to provide a representation of the match outcomes in a specific format.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to recognize that if there are an even number of players (N), it is impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because each player would have to win and lose an equal number of matches, which is not feasible. However, if N is odd, we can create a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly one match against one player and loses against another, ensuring that the wins are evenly distributed. We can represent the results in a matrix format where each row corresponds to a player and each column indicates whether that player won against another player.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           if N is even:

           else:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to create a tournament where each player wins the same number of matches. If the number of players \( N \) is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches, so we should output "NO". If \( N \) is odd, we need to construct a valid win/loss matrix.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   In the previous solution, the logic for filling the matrix was incorrect. The way I was determining the winners was flawed. Specifically, the line:
   ```python
   matrix[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'
   ```
   does not ensure that each player wins exactly one match and loses exactly one match. Instead, it creates a situation where some players may end up winning more than one match or having contradictory results.

3. **Correcting the Logic**:
   For an odd number of players, we can use a round-robin approach where each player beats the next player in a circular manner. For example, player 0 beats player 1, player 1 beats player 2, and so on, with the last player beating the first player. This ensures that each player wins exactly one match and loses exactly one match.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   I will revise the code to correctly implement this logic. Each player will win against the next player in a circular manner, and the matrix will be filled accordingly.

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 == 0:  # Check if N is even
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Create an N x N matrix initialized with '0'
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                # Each player i wins against player (i + 1) % N
                matrix[i][(i + 1) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against the next player
                matrix[(i + 1) % N][i] = '0'  # The next player loses to player i
            for row in matrix:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

solve_tournament(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- The matrix is filled such that each player wins against the next player in a circular manner.
- The output format is maintained as required, ensuring that each player has exactly one win and one loss. 

This should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to determine if a tennis tournament with \( N \) players could be structured such that each player wins the same number of matches. The key insight was recognizing that if \( N \) is even, it's impossible for all players to have the same number of wins, while if \( N \) is odd, a valid structure can be created.

Initially, I incorrectly filled the win/loss matrix, leading to potential contradictions in match outcomes. The correct approach involved a circular win pattern where each player wins against the next player in line, ensuring that each player has exactly one win and one loss.

The final solution effectively checks the parity of \( N \) and constructs the matrix accordingly. The code snippet below reflects the correct implementation:

```python
def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 == 0:  # Check if N is even
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                matrix[i][(i + 1) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against the next player
            for row in matrix:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string
```

This experience reinforced the importance of carefully constructing data structures to meet specific requirements and highlighted the need to validate logic against the problem constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

-----Output:-----
- If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
- Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
- If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
- You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
- You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $2 \leq N \leq 100$

-----Subtasks-----

001
100
NO

-----Explanation:-----
One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem involves a tennis tournament where each player competes against every other player exactly once, and there are no ties. The goal is to determine if it's possible for all players to win the same number of matches. If it is possible, we need to provide a representation of the match outcomes in a specific format.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to recognize that if there are an even number of players (N), it is impossible for each player to win the same number of matches because each player would have to win and lose an equal number of matches, which is not feasible. However, if N is odd, we can create a round-robin tournament where each player wins exactly one match against one player and loses against another, ensuring that the wins are evenly distributed. We can represent the results in a matrix format where each row corresponds to a player and each column indicates whether that player won against another player.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = test_case
           if N is even:
               print "NO"
           else:
               print "YES"

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [prompt] Let's analyze the issues step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   The goal is to create a tournament where each player wins the same number of matches. If the number of players \( N \) is even, it's impossible for each player to win the same number of matches, so we should output "NO". If \( N \) is odd, we need to construct a valid win/loss matrix.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   In the previous solution, the logic for filling the matrix was incorrect. The way I was determining the winners was flawed. Specifically, the line:
   ```python
   matrix[i][(i + j) % N] = '1'
   ```
   does not ensure that each player wins exactly one match and loses exactly one match. Instead, it creates a situation where some players may end up winning more than one match or having contradictory results.

3. **Correcting the Logic**:
   For an odd number of players, we can use a round-robin approach where each player beats the next player in a circular manner. For example, player 0 beats player 1, player 1 beats player 2, and so on, with the last player beating the first player. This ensures that each player wins exactly one match and loses exactly one match.

4. **Revising the Code**:
   I will revise the code to correctly implement this logic. Each player will win against the next player in a circular manner, and the matrix will be filled accordingly.

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
    for N in test_cases:
        if N % 2 == 0:  # Check if N is even
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")
            # Create an N x N matrix initialized with '0'
            matrix = [['0'] * N for _ in range(N)]
            for i in range(N):
                # Each player i wins against player (i + 1) % N
                matrix[i][(i + 1) % N] = '1'  # Player i wins against the next player
                matrix[(i + 1) % N][i] = '0'  # The next player loses to player i
            for row in matrix:
                print(''.join(row))  # Print each row as a string

# Read the number of test cases
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N = int(input())
    test_cases.append(N)

solve_tournament(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes:
- The matrix is filled such that each player wins against the next player in a circular manner.
- The output format is maintained as required, ensuring that each player has exactly one win and one loss. 

This should now correctly handle the requirements of the problem.

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code first reads the number of test cases \( T \) and then reads \( N \) for each test case, storing them in a list.
2. **Tournament Logic**:
   - If \( N \) is even, it prints "NO" since it's impossible for all players to win the same number of matches.
   - If \( N \) is odd, it prints "YES" and constructs a win/loss matrix.
3. **Matrix Construction**:
   - The matrix is initialized with '0's.
   - Each player \( i \) wins against the next player in a circular manner, ensuring that each player wins exactly one match and loses exactly one match.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the matrix row by row, converting each row list to a string.

INFO - [Task id] 1573 [generation text] In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I recognize that my initial approach to constructing the win/loss matrix was flawed. I incorrectly implemented the logic for determining match outcomes, which led to incorrect results in some cases. The key insight from the official solution is the use of a straightforward method to ensure that each player wins exactly one match and loses one match when \( N \) is odd.

The official solution effectively checks if \( N \) is even or odd. If \( N \) is even, it outputs "NO" since equal wins are impossible. If \( N \) is odd, it constructs a list for each player that tracks their wins. The inner loop iterates through half of the players, ensuring that each player wins against the next player in a circular manner. This guarantees that the win/loss distribution is balanced.

A notable difference in the official solution is the use of a list to count wins, which is then converted to a string for output. This approach is efficient and clear, avoiding the need for a full matrix representation. The final output is constructed in a way that directly reflects the win/loss results without needing to manage a two-dimensional array.

In summary, the official solution's method of using a single list to track wins and its clear handling of the circular win condition provide a more efficient and straightforward approach to solving the problem. This experience highlights the importance of carefully considering the logic behind constructing tournament outcomes and the potential for simplification in problem-solving.
