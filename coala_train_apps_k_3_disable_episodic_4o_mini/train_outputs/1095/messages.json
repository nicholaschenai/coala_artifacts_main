He wants to rearrange them in ascending order (1, 2, ..., N) using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can take any book and place it in a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine how many moves are necessary to achieve the sorted order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to identify the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. The reason for this is that the books that are already in the correct position do not need to be moved.

Here is an example for a $5 \\times 5$ chessboard.\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix}\n    \\bf{1} & 2 & \\bf{5} & 6 & \\bf{9} \\\\\\\n    2 & \\bf{5} & 6 & \\bf{9} & 8 \\\\\\\n    \\bf{5} & 6 & \\bf{9} & 8 & \\bf{7} \\\\\\\n    6 & \\bf{9} & 8 & \\bf{7} & 4 \\\\\\\n    \\bf{9} & 8 & \\bf{7} & 4 & \\bf{3} \\\\\\\n    \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    Let `D[i][j]` denote the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonals with indices up to `i` which have the same color as diagonal `i`.\n    Then `i = 1...2N-1` and `j = 0...K`.\n\n    We can calculate `D[i][j]` using only values of `D[i-2]` (we subtract 2 because we only consider diagonals of the same color as $i$).\n    There are two ways to get `D[i][j]`.\n    Either we place all `j` bishops on previous diagonals: then there are `D[i-2][j]` ways to achieve this.\n    Or we place one bishop on diagonal `i` and `j-1` bishops on previous diagonals.\n    The number of ways to do this equals the number of squares in diagonal `i` minus `j-1`, because each of `j-1` bishops placed on previous diagonals will block one square on the current diagonal.\n    The number of squares in diagonal `i` can be calculated as follows:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int squares (int i) {\n        if (i & 1)\n            return i / 4 * 2 + 1;\n        else\n            return (i - 1) / 4 * 2 + 2;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The base case is simple: `D[i][0] = 1`, `D[1][1] = 1`.\n\n    Once we have calculated all values of `D[i][j]`, the answer can be obtained as follows:\n    consider all possible numbers of bishops placed on black diagonals `i=0...K`, with corresponding numbers of bishops on white diagonals `K-i`.\n    The bishops placed on black and white diagonals never attack each other, so the placements can be done independently.\n    The index of the last black diagonal is `2N-1`, the last white one is `2N-2`.\n    For each `i` we add `D[2N-1][i] * D[2N-2][K-i]` to the answer.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n    int bishop_placements(int N, int K)\n    {\n        if (K > 2 * N - 1)\n            return 0;\n\n        vector<vector<int>> D(N * 2, vector<int>(K + 1));\n        for (int i = 0; i < N * 2; ++i)\n            D[i][0] = 1;\n        D[1][1] = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i < N * 2; ++i)\n            for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j)\n                D[i][j] = D[i-2][j] + D[i-2][j-1] * (squares(i) - j + 1);\n\n        int ans = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i)\n            ans += D[N*2-1][i] * D[N*2-2][K-i];\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of finding the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array by jumping according to specific rules, I initially implemented a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The main challenge was ensuring that the jump validity checks were correctly implemented, particularly the requirement that all intermediate values between the starting and destination indices must be less than the value at the starting index.\n\n    Initially, the code failed to account for all valid paths due to incorrect jump validity checks and an inefficient counting mechanism. The use of a visited set was appropriate to prevent revisiting indices, but it led to missed paths when not managed correctly.\n\n    The successful strategy involved implementing memoization to store results for previously computed indices, which significantly improved efficiency and ensured that all valid paths were explored. The final implementation correctly checks both left and right jumps within the allowed distance and verifies that all intermediate values meet the required conditions.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:\n            memo = {}\n        \n            def dfs(index):\n                if index in memo:\n                    return memo[index]\n            \n                max_count = 1\n            \n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index + x < len(arr) and arr[index] > arr[index + x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))\n            \n                for x in range(1, d + 1):\n                    if index - x >= 0 and arr[index] > arr[index - x]:\n                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):\n                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x))\n            \n                memo[index] = max_count\n                return max_count\n\n            max_jumps = 0\n            for index in range(len(arr)):\n                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index))\n            return max_jumps\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing state in recursive functions and the benefits of memoization in optimizing performance.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.\n\n    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.\n\n    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:\n            total_weight = sum(stones)\n            target = total_weight // 2\n            dp = [False] * (target + 1)\n            dp[0] = True\n\n            for stone in stones:\n                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):\n                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]\n\n            for j in range(target, -1, -1):\n                if dp[j]:\n                    return total_weight - 2 * j\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
