    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   Indraneel has a collection of books arranged in a specific order, and he wants to rearrange them in ascending order (from 1 to N). He can move any book to any position on the shelf. The goal is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can identify the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. The books that are not part of this subsequence will need to be moved. The minimum number of moves required will be equal to the total number of books minus the length of this longest subsequence. We can use a dynamic programming approach to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n       # Create an array to store the longest increasing subsequence lengths\n       lis = array of size N initialized to 1\n       \n       # Calculate the longest increasing subsequence\n       for i from 1 to N-1:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if books[i] > books[j]:\n                   lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)\n       \n       # The length of the longest increasing subsequence\n       longest_increasing_length = max(lis)\n       \n       # The minimum moves required\n       return N - longest_increasing_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n    # Create an array to store the longest increasing subsequence lengths\n    lis = [1] * N\n    \n    # Calculate the longest increasing subsequence\n    for i in range(1, N):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if books[i] > books[j]:\n                lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)\n    \n    # The length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    longest_increasing_length = max(lis)\n    \n    # The minimum moves required\n    return N - longest_increasing_length\n\n# Read input\nN = int(input())\nbooks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Output the result\nprint(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))\n```",
