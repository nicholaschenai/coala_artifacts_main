## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Output:-----
A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq N \leq 200000$.
- You may also assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs, $1 \leq N \leq 5000$.

-----Sample Input-----

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Indraneel has a collection of books numbered from 1 to N, arranged in a certain order on a shelf. He wants to rearrange them in ascending order (1, 2, ..., N) using the minimum number of moves. In each move, he can take any book and place it in a different position on the shelf. The task is to determine how many moves are necessary to achieve the sorted order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to identify the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. The reason for this is that the books that are already in the correct position do not need to be moved. The minimum number of moves required to sort the shelf will then be the total number of books minus the length of this longest subsequence. We can find this longest subsequence using a method similar to finding the longest increasing subsequence.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
       create an array 'position' of size N+1
       for i from 0 to N-1:
           position[books[i]] = i
       
       longest_increasing_length = 0
       current_length = 0
       
       for i from 1 to N:
           if position[i] > position[i-1]:
               current_length += 1
           else:

    Title: Placing Bishops on a Chessboard
    Part: 1/1
    # Placing Bishops on a Chessboard

    Find the number of ways to place $K$ bishops on an $N \times N$ chessboard so that no two bishops attack each other.

    ## Algorithm

    This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

    Let's enumerate the diagonals of the chessboard as follows: black diagonals have odd indices, white diagonals have even indices, and the diagonals are numbered in non-decreasing order of the number of squares in them. Here is an example for a $5 \times 5$ chessboard.

    $$\begin{matrix}
    \bf{1} & 2 & \bf{5} & 6 & \bf{9} \\\
    2 & \bf{5} & 6 & \bf{9} & 8 \\\
    \bf{5} & 6 & \bf{9} & 8 & \bf{7} \\\
    6 & \bf{9} & 8 & \bf{7} & 4 \\\
    \bf{9} & 8 & \bf{7} & 4 & \bf{3} \\\
    \end{matrix}$$

    Let `D[i][j]` denote the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonals with indices up to `i` which have the same color as diagonal `i`.
    Then `i = 1...2N-1` and `j = 0...K`.

    We can calculate `D[i][j]` using only values of `D[i-2]` (we subtract 2 because we only consider diagonals of the same color as $i$).
    There are two ways to get `D[i][j]`.
    Either we place all `j` bishops on previous diagonals: then there are `D[i-2][j]` ways to achieve this.
    Or we place one bishop on diagonal `i` and `j-1` bishops on previous diagonals.
    The number of ways to do this equals the number of squares in diagonal `i` minus `j-1`, because each of `j-1` bishops placed on previous diagonals will block one square on the current diagonal.
    The number of squares in diagonal `i` can be calculated as follows:

    ```cpp
    int squares (int i) {
        if (i & 1)
            return i / 4 * 2 + 1;
        else
            return (i - 1) / 4 * 2 + 2;
    }
    ```

    The base case is simple: `D[i][0] = 1`, `D[1][1] = 1`.

    Once we have calculated all values of `D[i][j]`, the answer can be obtained as follows:
    consider all possible numbers of bishops placed on black diagonals `i=0...K`, with corresponding numbers of bishops on white diagonals `K-i`.
    The bishops placed on black and white diagonals never attack each other, so the placements can be done independently.
    The index of the last black diagonal is `2N-1`, the last white one is `2N-2`.
    For each `i` we add `D[2N-1][i] * D[2N-2][K-i]` to the answer.

    ## Implementation

    ```cpp
    int bishop_placements(int N, int K)
    {
        if (K > 2 * N - 1)
            return 0;

        vector<vector<int>> D(N * 2, vector<int>(K + 1));
        for (int i = 0; i < N * 2; ++i)
            D[i][0] = 1;
        D[1][1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i < N * 2; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j)
                D[i][j] = D[i-2][j] + D[i-2][j-1] * (squares(i) - j + 1);

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i)
            ans += D[N*2-1][i] * D[N*2-2][K-i];
        return ans;
    }
    ```

[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of finding the maximum number of indices that can be visited in an array by jumping according to specific rules, I initially implemented a depth-first search (DFS) approach. The main challenge was ensuring that the jump validity checks were correctly implemented, particularly the requirement that all intermediate values between the starting and destination indices must be less than the value at the starting index.

    Initially, the code failed to account for all valid paths due to incorrect jump validity checks and an inefficient counting mechanism. The use of a visited set was appropriate to prevent revisiting indices, but it led to missed paths when not managed correctly.

    The successful strategy involved implementing memoization to store results for previously computed indices, which significantly improved efficiency and ensured that all valid paths were explored. The final implementation correctly checks both left and right jumps within the allowed distance and verifies that all intermediate values meet the required conditions.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def maxJumps(self, arr: list[int], d: int) -> int:
            memo = {}
        
            def dfs(index):
                if index in memo:
                    return memo[index]
            
                max_count = 1
            
                for x in range(1, d + 1):
                    if index + x < len(arr) and arr[index] > arr[index + x]:
                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index + 1, index + x + 1)):
                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index + x))
            
                for x in range(1, d + 1):
                    if index - x >= 0 and arr[index] > arr[index - x]:
                        if all(arr[index] > arr[i] for i in range(index - 1, index - x - 1, -1)):
                            max_count = max(max_count, 1 + dfs(index - x))
            
                memo[index] = max_count
                return max_count

            max_jumps = 0
            for index in range(len(arr)):
                max_jumps = max(max_jumps, dfs(index))
            return max_jumps
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing state in recursive functions and the benefits of memoization in optimizing performance.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.

    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.

    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            total_weight = sum(stones)
            target = total_weight // 2
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True

            for stone in stones:
                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    return total_weight - 2 * j
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Indraneel has to sort the books in his library. His library has one long shelf. His books are numbered $1$ through $N$ and he wants to rearrange the books so that they appear in the sequence $1,2, ..., N$.
He intends to do this by a sequence of moves. In each move he can pick up any book from the shelf and insert it at a different place in the shelf. Suppose Indraneel has $5$ books and they are initially arranged in the order
21453214532 \quad 1 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Indraneel will rearrange this in ascending order by first moving book $1$ to the beginning of the shelf to get
12453124531 \quad 2 \quad 4 \quad 5 \quad 3
Then, moving book $3$ to position $3$, he gets
12345123451 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4 \quad 5
Your task is to write a program to help Indraneel determine the minimum number of moves that are necessary to sort his book shelf.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input will contain a single integer $N$ indicating the number of books in Indraneel's library. This is followed by a line containing a permutation of $1, 2, ..., N$ indicating the intial state of Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Output:-----
A single integer indicating the minimum number of moves necessary to sort Indraneel's book-shelf.

-----Constraints:-----

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Indraneel has a collection of books arranged in a specific order, and he wants to rearrange them in ascending order (from 1 to N). He can move any book to any position on the shelf. The goal is to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort the books.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can identify the longest subsequence of books that are already in the correct order. The books that are not part of this subsequence will need to be moved. The minimum number of moves required will be equal to the total number of books minus the length of this longest subsequence. We can use a dynamic programming approach to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The approach involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the current arrangement, as the books not in this subsequence would need to be moved.

The solution utilized a dynamic programming technique to compute the LIS. The key steps included initializing an array to track the lengths of increasing subsequences and iterating through the books to update these lengths based on comparisons. The final result was derived by subtracting the length of the LIS from the total number of books.

The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test case. The main takeaway is the effectiveness of the LIS approach in minimizing moves for sorting problems, which can be applied to similar scenarios involving permutations and orderings. 

Here’s the core code snippet for future reference:

```python
def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
    lis = [1] * N
    for i in range(1, N):
        for j in range(i):
            if books[i] > books[j]:
                lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)
    longest_increasing_length = max(lis)
    return N - longest_increasing_length

N = int(input())
books = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))
``` 

This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
n=int(input())
arr=[int(x) for x in input().split()]
l=[1]*n
if sorted(arr)==arr:
    print('0')
else:
    for i in range(0,len(arr)):

            if arr[i]>=arr[j] and l[i]<l[j]+1:
                l[i]=l[j]+1
    print(n-max(l))

INFO - [Task id] 1095 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem of sorting the books by determining the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in the given arrangement. The key insight is that the minimum number of moves required to sort the books is equal to the total number of books minus the length of the LIS. This approach is efficient and straightforward.

### Key Steps in the Official Solution:
1. **Input Handling**: The solution reads the number of books and their current arrangement.
2. **Initial Check**: It checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, it immediately returns `0` as no moves are needed.
3. **LIS Calculation**: It initializes an array `l` to keep track of the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each index. The nested loops compare each book with the previous ones to update the LIS lengths.
4. **Final Calculation**: The minimum moves required are calculated as the total number of books minus the maximum value in the `l` array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

### Insights:
- The official solution is efficient in terms of time complexity, operating in O(N^2), which is acceptable given the constraints.
- The check for already sorted input at the beginning optimizes the solution by avoiding unnecessary calculations.
- The use of a single array to track LIS lengths is a space-efficient approach.

Overall, the official solution is clear and effective, and it reinforces the importance of checking for edge cases early in the implementation. My initial approach was similar but lacked the early exit for already sorted cases, which could lead to unnecessary computations.
