Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. Each test case provides the colors of the six sides of the cube, and we need to check for each test case if such a triplet of adjacent sides exists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to identify the sets of three sides that are adjacent to each other on a cube. The pairs of adjacent sides can be grouped as follows:
   - Front, Left, Top
   - Front, Right, Top
   - Back, Left, Top
   - Back, Right, Top
   - Front, Left, Bottom
   - Front, Right, Bottom
   - Back, Left, Bottom
   - Back, Right, Bottom

   For each test case, we will check if any of these groups of three sides have the same color. If we find at least one such group, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read colors for front, back, left, right, top, bottom
           check the following combinations:
               if (front == left == top) or
                  (front == right == top) or
                  (back == left == top) or
                  (back == right == top) or
                  (front == left == bottom) or
                  (front == right == bottom) or
                  (back == left == bottom) or
                  (back == right == bottom):
                   output "YES"
               else:
                   output "NO"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def check_adjacent_colors(test_cases):
    results = []
    for colors in test_cases:
        front, back, left, right, top, bottom = colors

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides a more concise and efficient approach to solving the problem of counting triangles formed by points of the same color. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

    1. **Data Organization**: The solution uses a dictionary `p` to group points by their colors. This allows for easy access to all points of a specific color when calculating triangles.

    2. **Triangle Counting**: The solution employs the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of three points for each color. It then checks if these points can form a valid triangle using the `triangle` function.

    3. **Area Calculation**: The `triangle` function determines if three points form a triangle by calculating the lengths of the sides and checking if the area is greater than zero. This is done using the `area` function, which computes the area using Heron's formula.

    4. **Final Output**: The solution constructs the final output by calculating the total number of points, the number of unique colors, the total number of triangles, and identifying the color(s) with the maximum number of triangles.

    5. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It avoids unnecessary checks and directly computes the required values in a streamlined manner.

    In contrast, my initial approach had issues with correctly identifying when no triangles could be formed and ensuring the output format matched the expected results. The official solution's use of area calculation for triangle validity is a more robust method than my determinant approach, which could lead to inaccuracies in certain configurations. Overall, the official solution is a good reference for efficiently handling similar problems in the future.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.

    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.

[Summary]:
    The problem involved determining if a grid arrangement of beds in a hospital was "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on the adjacency of beds represented by '1's in a square grid. The key concept was to check for adjacent '1's in the grid, while allowing diagonal placements to be safe.

    The solution was structured into two main functions: `is_safe_area` to check the grid for adjacent beds, and `solve` to handle input and output. The adjacency check involved iterating through each cell and checking its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) for '1's. If any adjacent '1's were found, the arrangement was marked as "UNSAFE".

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The core strategy of checking adjacent cells was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during the process. This experience reinforced the importance of careful adjacency checks in grid-based problems. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def is_safe_area(grid):
        N = len(grid)
        for row in range(N):
            for column in range(N):
                if grid[row][column] == 1:
                    if (row > 0 and grid[row-1][column] == 1) or \
                       (row < N-1 and grid[row+1][column] == 1) or \
                       (column > 0 and grid[row][column-1] == 1) or \
                       (column < N-1 and grid[row][column+1] == 1):
                        return "UNSAFE"
        return "SAFE"

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem requires us to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. Each cube has six sides, and we need to check multiple test cases to see if such a combination exists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to identify the pairs of adjacent sides on a cube. The pairs of adjacent sides can be grouped as follows:
   - Front, Left, Top
   - Front, Right, Top
   - Back, Left, Top
   - Back, Right, Top
   - Front, Left, Bottom
   - Front, Right, Bottom
   - Back, Left, Bottom
   - Back, Right, Bottom

   For each test case, we will check if any of these combinations of three sides have the same color. If we find at least one combination that meets this criterion, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_adjacent_sides(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           colors = test_case
           if (colors[0] == colors[1] == colors[2]) or  // Front, Left, Top

    2. **Triangle Counting**: The solution employs the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of three points for each color. It then checks if these points can form a valid triangle using the `triangle` function.

    3. **Area Calculation**: The `triangle` function determines if three points form a triangle by calculating the lengths of the sides and checking if the area is greater than zero. This is done using the `area` function, which computes the area using Heron's formula.

    4. **Final Output**: The solution constructs the final output by calculating the total number of points, the number of unique colors, the total number of triangles, and identifying the color(s) with the maximum number of triangles.

    5. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It avoids unnecessary checks and directly computes the required values in a streamlined manner.

    In contrast, my initial approach had issues with correctly identifying when no triangles could be formed and ensuring the output format matched the expected results. The official solution's use of area calculation for triangle validity is a more robust method than my determinant approach, which could lead to inaccuracies in certain configurations. Overall, the official solution is a good reference for efficiently handling similar problems in the future.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.

    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.

[Summary]:
    The problem involved determining if a grid arrangement of beds in a hospital was "SAFE" or "UNSAFE" based on the adjacency of beds represented by '1's in a square grid. The key concept was to check for adjacent '1's in the grid, while allowing diagonal placements to be safe.

    The solution was structured into two main functions: `is_safe_area` to check the grid for adjacent beds, and `solve` to handle input and output. The adjacency check involved iterating through each cell and checking its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) for '1's. If any adjacent '1's were found, the arrangement was marked as "UNSAFE".

    The implementation was straightforward and successfully passed the provided test cases. The core strategy of checking adjacent cells was effective, and no unexpected errors occurred during the process. This experience reinforced the importance of careful adjacency checks in grid-based problems.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The problem requires us to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. Each cube has six sides, and we need to check multiple test cases to see if such a combination exists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we need to identify the pairs of adjacent sides on a cube. The pairs of adjacent sides can be grouped as follows:
   - Front, Left, Top
   - Front, Right, Top
   - Back, Left, Top
   - Back, Right, Top
   - Front, Left, Bottom
   - Front, Right, Bottom
   - Back, Left, Bottom
   - Back, Right, Bottom

   For each test case, we will check if any of these combinations of three sides have the same color. If we find at least one combination that meets this criterion, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_adjacent_sides(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           colors = test_case
           if (colors[0] == colors[1] == colors[2]) or  // Front, Left, Top
              (colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[2]) or  // Front, Right, Top

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `check_adjacent_sides` takes a list of test cases, where each test case contains the colors of the cube's sides.
2. **Checking Combinations**: For each test case, it checks all possible combinations of three adjacent sides to see if they are the same color.
3. **Input Handling**: The number of test cases is read first, followed by reading the colors for each test case.
4. **Output**: For each test case, it prints "YES" if there are three adjacent sides of the same color, otherwise it prints "NO".

    colors = input().split()
    test_cases.append(colors)

# Check for adjacent sides in the test cases
check_adjacent_sides(test_cases)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `check_adjacent_sides` takes a list of test cases, where each test case contains the colors of the cube's sides.
2. **Checking Combinations**: For each test case, it checks all possible combinations of three adjacent sides to see if they are the same color.
3. **Input Handling**: The number of test cases is read first, followed by reading the colors for each test case.
4. **Output**: For each test case, it prints "YES" if there are three adjacent sides of the same color, otherwise it prints "NO".

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] To address the problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Restate the Problem
We need to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. The cube has six sides, and for each test case, we are given the colors of these sides in a specific order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom.

### Step 2: Conceptualize a Solution
To solve this problem, we need to identify the pairs of adjacent sides on the cube. The pairs of adjacent sides can be grouped as follows:
- (front, left, top)
- (front, right, top)
- (front, left, bottom)
- (front, right, bottom)
- (back, left, top)
- (back, right, top)
- (back, left, bottom)
- (back, right, bottom)

For each test case, we will check if any of these groups of three sides have the same color. If we find at least one such group, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

### Step 3: Pseudocode Solution
1. Read the number of test cases, T.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the colors of the six sides.
   - Check the eight combinations of adjacent sides.
   - If any combination has the same color, print "YES".
   - If none do, print "NO".

### Step 4: Final Python 3 Solution
Now, let's implement the solution in Python.

```python
def check_adjacent_sides(T, cases):
    results = []
    
    for i in range(T):
        colors = cases[i]
        
        # Check the eight combinations of adjacent sides
        if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # front, left, top
            colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # front, right, top
            colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # front, left, bottom
            colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # front, right, bottom
            colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # back, left, top
            colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # back, right, top
            colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # back, left, bottom
            colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):    # back, right, bottom
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results

# Read input
T = int(input())
cases = [input().split() for _ in range(T)]

# Get results
results = check_adjacent_sides(T, cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We define a function `check_adjacent_sides` that takes the number of test cases and a list of cases.
- For each case, we check the eight combinations of adjacent sides to see if any three sides are the same color.
- We store the results ("YES" or "NO") in a list and print them after processing all test cases.
- The input is read from standard input, and the results are printed to standard output.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.

    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.

    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.

    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.

    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Read number of boxes and capacity of each box
            ducks = case[2]  # Read the list of duck counts
            boxes = []  # This will hold the distribution of ducks in each box
        
            # Create a list of colors with their counts
            color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]
        
            # Fill each box
            for _ in range(N):
                m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box
                c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box
            
                # Try to fill the box with ducks
                for i in range(len(color_counts)):
                    if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full
                        if color_counts[i][1] > 0:  # If there are ducks of this color

    The official solution provides a more concise and efficient approach to solving the problem of counting triangles formed by points of the same color. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

    1. **Data Organization**: The solution uses a dictionary `p` to group points by their colors. This allows for easy access to all points of a specific color when calculating triangles.

    2. **Triangle Counting**: The solution employs the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible combinations of three points for each color. It then checks if these points can form a valid triangle using the `triangle` function.

    3. **Area Calculation**: The `triangle` function determines if three points form a triangle by calculating the lengths of the sides and checking if the area is greater than zero. This is done using the `area` function, which computes the area using Heron's formula.

    4. **Final Output**: The solution constructs the final output by calculating the total number of points, the number of unique colors, the total number of triangles, and identifying the color(s) with the maximum number of triangles.

    5. **Efficiency**: The official solution is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. It avoids unnecessary checks and directly computes the required values in a streamlined manner.

    In contrast, my initial approach had issues with correctly identifying when no triangles could be formed and ensuring the output format matched the expected results. The official solution's use of area calculation for triangle validity is a more robust method than my determinant approach, which could lead to inaccuracies in certain configurations. Overall, the official solution is a good reference for efficiently handling similar problems in the future.

- The input is read from standard input, and the results are printed to standard output.

This implementation is efficient and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement. Each test case is processed in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [prompt] To address the problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Restate the Problem
We need to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. The cube has six sides, and for each test case, we are given the colors of these sides in a specific order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom.

### Step 2: Conceptualize a Solution
To solve this problem, we need to identify the pairs of adjacent sides on the cube. The pairs of adjacent sides can be grouped as follows:
- (front, left, top)
- (front, right, top)
- (front, left, bottom)
- (front, right, bottom)
- (back, left, top)
- (back, right, top)
- (back, left, bottom)
- (back, right, bottom)

For each test case, we will check if any of these groups of three sides have the same color. If we find at least one such group, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

### Step 3: Pseudocode Solution
1. Read the number of test cases, T.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the colors of the six sides.
   - Check the eight combinations of adjacent sides.
   - If any combination has the same color, print "YES".
   - If none do, print "NO".

### Step 4: Final Python 3 Solution
Now, let's implement the solution in Python.

```python
def check_adjacent_sides(T, cases):
    results = []
    
    for i in range(T):
        colors = cases[i]
        
        # Check the eight combinations of adjacent sides
        if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # front, left, top
            colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # front, right, top
            colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # front, left, bottom
            colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # front, right, bottom
            colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # back, left, top
            colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # back, right, top
            colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # back, left, bottom
            colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):    # back, right, bottom
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results

# Read input
T = int(input())
cases = [input().split() for _ in range(T)]

# Get results
results = check_adjacent_sides(T, cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We define a function `check_adjacent_sides` that takes the number of test cases and a list of cases.
- For each case, we check the eight combinations of adjacent sides to see if any three sides are the same color.
- We store the results ("YES" or "NO") in a list and print them after processing all test cases.
- The input is read from standard input, and the results are printed to standard output.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to determine if three adjacent sides of a cube were painted the same color based on given test cases. The solution involved checking specific combinations of adjacent sides for color matches. 

The core concept tested was understanding the spatial relationships of a cube's sides and efficiently checking for color equality among them. The eight combinations of adjacent sides were identified and checked using simple conditional statements.

The initial implementation was correct in logic but required clarity and adherence to the problem's constraints. The final solution efficiently processed each test case in constant time, leading to an overall complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases.

Key code snippet for checking adjacent sides:
```python
if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # front, left, top
    colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # front, right, top
    colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # front, left, bottom
    colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # front, right, bottom
    colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # back, left, top
    colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # back, right, top
    colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # back, left, bottom
    colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):    # back, right, bottom
```

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding geometric relationships in programming problems and the need for clear, efficient code.

INFO - [Task id] 1227 [prompt] To address the problem, let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Restate the Problem
We need to determine if there are three adjacent sides of a cube that are painted the same color. The cube has six sides, and for each test case, we are given the colors of these sides in a specific order: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom.

### Step 2: Conceptualize a Solution
To solve this problem, we need to identify the pairs of adjacent sides on the cube. The pairs of adjacent sides can be grouped as follows:
- (front, left, top)
- (front, right, top)
- (front, left, bottom)
- (front, right, bottom)
- (back, left, top)
- (back, right, top)
- (back, left, bottom)
- (back, right, bottom)

For each test case, we will check if any of these groups of three sides have the same color. If we find at least one such group, we will output "YES"; otherwise, we will output "NO".

### Step 3: Pseudocode Solution
1. Read the number of test cases, T.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the colors of the six sides.
   - Check the eight combinations of adjacent sides.
   - If any combination has the same color, print "YES".
   - If none do, print "NO".

### Step 4: Final Python 3 Solution
Now, let's implement the solution in Python.

```python

    results = []

    for i in range(T):
        colors = cases[i]
        
        # Check the eight combinations of adjacent sides
        if (colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[4] or  # front, left, top
            colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[4] or  # front, right, top
            colors[0] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # front, left, bottom
            colors[0] == colors[3] == colors[5] or  # front, right, bottom

            colors[1] == colors[2] == colors[5] or  # back, left, bottom
            colors[1] == colors[3] == colors[5]):    # back, right, bottom
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    return results

# Read input
T = int(input())
cases = [input().split() for _ in range(T)]

# Get results
results = check_adjacent_sides(T, cases)

# Print results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Code
- The function `check_adjacent_sides` processes each test case to check for three adjacent sides of the cube that are the same color.
- It checks all possible combinations of three adjacent sides and appends "YES" or "NO" to the results list based on whether a matching combination is found.
- The input is read from standard input, and the results are printed to standard output.

This implementation is efficient and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement. Each test case is processed in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

In tackling the problem of determining if three adjacent sides of a cube are painted the same color, my initial approach was logically sound and correctly identified the necessary combinations of sides to check. However, the official solution provided a more concise and efficient implementation.

**Key Insights from the Official Solution:**
1. **Use of Indexing**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent the indices of the adjacent sides directly. This approach simplifies the checking process by avoiding multiple conditional statements and instead iterating through predefined combinations.
  
2. **Set for Uniqueness**: The official solution leverages the `set` data structure to check if all three colors are the same. By converting the list of colors to a set, it effectively checks for uniqueness in a single line, which is both elegant and efficient.

3. **Control Flow**: The use of a counter (`c`) to track whether a match was found is straightforward, but the official solution could be further simplified by directly printing "YES" or "NO" based on the condition without needing an additional variable.

**Comparison with My Approach**:
- My solution explicitly checked each combination with multiple `or` conditions, which, while clear, could be seen as verbose compared to the official solution's use of a loop over a predefined list of combinations.
- The official solution's use of `set` for checking color equality is a more Pythonic approach, reducing the complexity of the condition checks.

### Conclusion
The official solution is more efficient in terms of readability and maintainability. It highlights the importance of leveraging built-in data structures and concise control flow in Python. In future problems, I will aim to adopt similar strategies to enhance the clarity and efficiency of my code.
