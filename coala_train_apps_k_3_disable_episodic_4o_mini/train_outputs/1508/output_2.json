    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights and corrections needed from the previous attempts, here is the revised code that correctly generates the desired pattern for each test case based on the integer \\( K \\). The logic has been adjusted to ensure that the output matches the specified requirements.\n\n### Revised Code:\n```python\ndef generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n    # Iterate through each test case\n    for K in test_cases:\n        # For each value of K, generate the pattern\n        for i in range(K):\n            line = \"\"\n            # Generate the line based on the current index\n            for j in range(i + 1):\n                line += str(j)  # Count up from 0 to i\n            # Print the generated line\n            print(line)\n        for i in range(K - 1, 0, -1):\n            line = \"\"\n            # Generate the line based on the current index\n            for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                line += str(j)  # Count down from i to 0\n            # Print the generated line\n            print(line)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\n# Read each test case into a list\ntest_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]\n# Call the function to generate the pattern\ngenerate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `generate_pattern` takes the number of test cases \\( T \\) and a list of test cases.\n2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the integer \\( K \\).\n3. **Generate Lines**:\n   - The first loop generates lines counting up from `0` to `i` for each line \\( i \\) from `0` to \\( K-1 \\).\n   - The second loop generates lines counting down from \\( i \\) to `0` for each line \\( i \\) from \\( K-1 \\) to `1`.\n4. **Output**: Each generated line is printed immediately after it is created.\n\nThis code should now correctly produce the required output for all test cases as specified in the problem statement.",
