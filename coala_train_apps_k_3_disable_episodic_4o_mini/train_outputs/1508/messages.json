The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\).\n\n    #### Key Insights:\n    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \\( f(P) \\) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \\( K \\) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.\n    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \\( f(P) \\)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \\( K \\) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.\n\n    #### Issues Encountered:\n    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \\( K \\). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.\n    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.\n\n    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:\n    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.\n    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet:\n    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \\( K \\). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                # Start with descending order\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_sum = max_value\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to reach K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_sum == K:\n                        break\n                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K\n                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)\n                    if max_reduce > 0:\n                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce\n                        current_sum -= max_reduce\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n        print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In my attempts to solve the permutation problem, I learned several key insights about the approach and logic required to derive a valid permutation that meets the specified conditions. \n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\). This understanding is crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a specific \\( K \\).\n\n    2. **Feasibility Conditions**: The official solution checks specific conditions to determine if \\( K \\) is achievable:\n       - For even \\( N \\), \\( K \\) must be within the bounds of \\( (N(N+1)/2 - 1) \\) and \\( 3((N/2)^2) - 1 \\).\n       - For odd \\( N \\), similar bounds apply, but with adjustments for the odd case.\n\n    3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution constructs the permutation by:\n       - Starting with a descending order.\n       - Adjusting elements based on the difference between the desired \\( K \\) and the maximum possible sum.\n       - Using a systematic approach to fill in the permutation while ensuring that the conditions for \\( K \\) are met.\n\n    4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution employs an iterative method to adjust the permutation based on the remaining value of \\( K \\) after accounting for the maximum possible sum. This involves incrementally modifying the permutation to reach the desired sum.\n\n    ### Code Snippet from Official Solution:\n    The official solution uses a structured approach to handle both even and odd cases, ensuring that the permutation is constructed correctly based on the conditions derived from \\( K \\).\n\n    ```python\n    if(n%2==0):\n        if(k<(n*(n+1))//2 - 1  or  k>3*((n//2)**2) - 1): print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    else:\n        if(n==1): print(1) if(k==0) else print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    The official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. My previous attempts failed primarily due to not fully accounting for the bounds of \\( K \\) and the systematic construction of the permutation. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and the need for a structured approach to constructing solutions in combinatorial problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

This understanding is crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a specific \\( K \\).\n\n    2. **Feasibility Conditions**: The official solution checks specific conditions to determine if \\( K \\) is achievable:\n       - For even \\( N \\), \\( K \\) must be within the bounds of \\( (N(N+1)/2 - 1) \\) and \\( 3((N/2)^2) - 1 \\).\n       - For odd \\( N \\), similar bounds apply, but with adjustments for the odd case.\n\n    3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution constructs the permutation by:\n       - Starting with a descending order.\n       - Adjusting elements based on the difference between the desired \\( K \\) and the maximum possible sum.\n       - Using a systematic approach to fill in the permutation while ensuring that the conditions for \\( K \\) are met.\n\n    4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution employs an iterative method to adjust the permutation based on the remaining value of \\( K \\) after accounting for the maximum possible sum. This involves incrementally modifying the permutation to reach the desired sum.\n\n    ### Code Snippet from Official Solution:\n    The official solution uses a structured approach to handle both even and odd cases, ensuring that the permutation is constructed correctly based on the conditions derived from \\( K \\).\n\n    ```python\n    if(n%2==0):\n        if(k<(n*(n+1))//2 - 1  or  k>3*((n//2)**2) - 1): print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    else:\n        if(n==1): print(1) if(k==0) else print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    The official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. My previous attempts failed primarily due to not fully accounting for the bounds of \\( K \\) and the systematic construction of the permutation. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and the need for a structured approach to constructing solutions in combinatorial problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\).\n\n    #### Key Insights:\n    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \\( f(P) \\) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \\( K \\) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.\n    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \\( f(P) \\)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \\( K \\) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.\n\n    #### Issues Encountered:\n    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \\( K \\). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.\n    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.\n\n    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:\n    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.\n    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet:\n    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \\( K \\). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                # Start with descending order\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_sum = max_value\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to reach K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_sum == K:\n                        break\n                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K\n                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)\n                    if max_reduce > 0:\n                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce\n                        current_sum -= max_reduce\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n        print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In my attempts to solve the permutation problem, I learned several key insights about the approach and logic required to derive a valid permutation that meets the specified conditions. \n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation.

The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\).\n\n    #### Key Insights:\n    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \\( f(P) \\) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \\( K \\) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.\n    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \\( f(P) \\)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \\( K \\) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.\n\n    #### Issues Encountered:\n    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \\( K \\). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.\n    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.\n\n    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:\n    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.\n    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet:\n    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \\( K \\). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                # Start with descending order\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_sum = max_value\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to reach K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_sum == K:\n                        break\n                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K\n                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)\n                    if max_reduce > 0:\n                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce\n                        current_sum -= max_reduce\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n        print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In my attempts to solve the permutation problem, I learned several key insights about the approach and logic required to derive a valid permutation that meets the specified conditions. \n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Understanding the Function f(P)**: The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\). This understanding is crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a specific \\( K \\).\n\n    2. **Feasibility Conditions**: The official solution checks specific conditions to determine if \\( K \\) is achievable:\n       - For even \\( N \\), \\( K \\) must be within the bounds of \\( (N(N+1)/2 - 1) \\) and \\( 3((N/2)^2) - 1 \\).\n       - For odd \\( N \\), similar bounds apply, but with adjustments for the odd case.\n\n    3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution constructs the permutation by:\n       - Starting with a descending order.\n       - Adjusting elements based on the difference between the desired \\( K \\) and the maximum possible sum.\n       - Using a systematic approach to fill in the permutation while ensuring that the conditions for \\( K \\) are met.\n\n    4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution employs an iterative method to adjust the permutation based on the remaining value of \\( K \\) after accounting for the maximum possible sum. This involves incrementally modifying the permutation to reach the desired sum.\n\n    ### Code Snippet from Official Solution:\n    The official solution uses a structured approach to handle both even and odd cases, ensuring that the permutation is constructed correctly based on the conditions derived from \\( K \\).\n\n    ```python\n    if(n%2==0):\n        if(k<(n*(n+1))//2 - 1  or  k>3*((n//2)**2) - 1): print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    else:\n        if(n==1): print(1) if(k==0) else print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    The official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. My previous attempts failed primarily due to not fully accounting for the bounds of \\( K \\) and the systematic construction of the permutation. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and the need for a structured approach to constructing solutions in combinatorial problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The official solution's approach is more effective in directly addressing the problem requirements and producing the expected output format.
