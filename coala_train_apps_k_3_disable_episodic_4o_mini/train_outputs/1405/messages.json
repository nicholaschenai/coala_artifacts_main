There are N imposters, and each imposter can increase the level of certain sabotages based on a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd). Specifically, the i-th imposter can increase the level of the x-th sabotage if the gcd of i and x equals i. We need to determine how many sabotages reach level 5 after all imposters have acted.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   Each sabotage can be upgraded by imposters whose indices are divisors of the sabotage's index. For a sabotage to reach level 5, it must be upgraded by 5 different imposters. This means that the index of the sabotage must have at least 5 distinct divisors. The number of distinct divisors of a number can be determined by its prime factorization. We need to find out how many numbers from 1 to N have at least 5 distinct divisors.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - For each test case:\n     - Initialize a counter for sabotages at level 5.\n     - Loop through numbers from 1 to N:\n       - For each number, calculate the number of distinct divisors.\n       - If the number of distinct divisors is 5 or more, increment the counter.\n     - Output the counter.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_sabotages_at_level_5(N):\n    # Function to count the number of distinct divisors of a number\n    def count_divisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1  # i is a divisor\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1  # n // i is also a divisor\n        return count\n\n    # Initialize the count of sabotages at level 5\n    level_5_count = 0\n    \n    # Check each number from 1 to N\n    for x in range(1, N + 1):\n        if count_divisors(x) >= 5:\n            level_5_count += 1\n    \n    return level_5_count\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        N = int(data[i])  # Read each N\n        results.append(count_sabotages_at_level_5(N))  # Calculate and store result\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n# The main function will be called when the script is executed\n```"

The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values.

The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where each schedule consists of dishes served over N days with specific constraints. The key requirements were that no two consecutive days could serve the same dish, and the first and last days must serve different dishes.\n\n    Initially, I derived a formula based on combinatorial reasoning, which was incorrect. The correct formula should have been \\(4 \\times 3^{(N-1)}\\) for \\(N \\geq 2\\). This accounts for:\n    - 4 choices for the first day.\n    - 3 choices for each subsequent day, including the last day, which must be different from the first.\n\n    The main errors in my attempts included:\n    1. Miscalculating the total schedules by incorrectly treating the last day as a separate case.\n    2. Failing to properly implement the formula in the code, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n    The final working code correctly implements the formula and uses an efficient power function to handle large exponents modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). The key takeaway is the importance of carefully analyzing constraints and ensuring that all conditions are accurately reflected in the mathematical model used for calculations. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def power(base, exp, mod):\n        result = 1\n        while exp > 0:\n            if exp % 2 == 1:\n                result = (result * base) % mod\n            base = (base * base) % mod\n            exp //= 2\n        return result\n\n    def calculate_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return 12\n        else:\n            return (4 * power(3, N-1, MOD)) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        T = int(input())\n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(input())\n            result = calculate_schedules(N)\n            print(result)\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of validating mathematical models against problem constraints and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the derived formulas.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This is an efficient algorithm for finding all primes up to a specified integer, which is crucial for determining the numbers that can be expressed as \\( p^4 \\).\n\n2. **Precomputation of Powers**: After generating the list of primes, the solution computes \\( p^4 \\) for each prime and stores these values in a list.
