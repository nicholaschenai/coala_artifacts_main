The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem, I learned that the series can be derived from a mathematical formula rather than through iterative summation. The official solution uses a direct formula to compute the N'th term efficiently, which is more optimal than my initial approach of summing squares.\n\n    The key insight from the official solution is the use of the formula:\n    - For N > 1, the N'th term can be calculated as:\n      \\[\n      T(N) = \\frac{(N-2 + 1)(2(N-2) + 3)(N-2 + 2)}{6}\n      \\]\n    This formula allows for constant time computation of the N'th term, significantly improving performance, especially for larger values of N (up to 10,000) and multiple test cases (up to 10,000).\n\n    My approach, which involved iterating through the first (N-1) natural numbers to compute the sum of squares, was less efficient and could lead to longer execution times for larger inputs. The official solution's method is not only more concise but also avoids unnecessary loops, making it a better choice for this problem.\n\n    In future problems, I should consider looking for mathematical patterns or formulas that can simplify calculations, especially when dealing with series or sequences. This experience reinforces the importance of analyzing the problem for potential mathematical solutions rather than relying solely on iterative methods.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Precomputation**:\n   - The solution precomputes the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit (in this case, \\(10^6 + 100\\)). This allows for quick access to the values of the sequence without recalculating them for each query.\n   - It also maintains two additional lists: `bin_storer` and `prefix_storer`. The `bin_storer` keeps track of cumulative sums of the Golomb numbers, while `prefix_storer` stores cumulative sums of the squares of the Golomb numbers.\n\n2. **Binary Search**:\n   - The function `find_upper_bound` is implemented to efficiently find the index in `bin_storer` that corresponds to the largest value less than or equal to a given key. This is crucial for quickly determining the range of indices that contribute to the sum of squares for any given query.\n\n3. **Query Handling**:\n   - The function `get_query` computes the adjusted sum of squares for a given upper limit using the precomputed `prefix_storer` and `bin_storer`. It calculates the surplus based on the difference between the actual value and the target, ensuring that the result is correctly adjusted modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n   - The `fire_query` function combines results from `get_query` for the lower and upper bounds of the query to get the final result.\n\n4. **Efficiency**:\n   - By precomputing values and using binary search, the solution significantly reduces the time complexity for each query, making it feasible to handle up to \\(10^5\\) queries efficiently, even with large values of \\(L\\) and \\(R\\).\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach involved recalculating the Golomb sequence for each query, which is inefficient given the constraints. The use of memoization was a step in the right direction, but it still did not match the efficiency of the official solution's precomputation and binary search strategy.
