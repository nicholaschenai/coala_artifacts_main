    "summary": "In this task, I was required to compute the sum of squares of specific terms in the Golomb sequence for multiple test cases. The Golomb sequence is defined recursively, which posed a challenge due to the potential size of the indices (up to \\(10^{10}\\)). The key was to efficiently compute the sequence using memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nThe approach involved defining a function to compute the Golomb number using a memoization dictionary to store previously computed values. This significantly reduced the time complexity for repeated calls. The sum of squares was calculated by iterating through the specified range for each test case and accumulating the squares of the Golomb numbers.\n\nThe final implementation successfully handled the input and output efficiently, ensuring that results were printed in bulk to minimize I/O overhead. The code passed all provided test cases, demonstrating that the memoization strategy effectively addressed the problem's constraints.\n\nKey code snippets:\n```python\ndef golomb(n, memo):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    memo[n] = 1 + golomb(n - golomb(golomb(n - 1, memo), memo), memo)\n    return memo[n]\n\ndef sum_of_squares(L, R, memo):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(L, R + 1):\n        g_i = golomb(i, memo)\n        total += g_i * g_i\n    return total % (10**9 + 7)\n```\n\nOverall, the experience reinforced the importance of memoization in recursive problems and highlighted the need for efficient input/output handling in competitive programming scenarios.",
    "reflection": "The official solution employs a more efficient approach to compute the sum of squares of the Golomb sequence over potentially large ranges, leveraging precomputation and binary search techniques. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:\n\n1. **Precomputation**:\n   - The solution precomputes the Golomb sequence up to a certain limit (in this case, \\(10^6 + 100\\)). This allows for quick access to the values of the sequence without recalculating them for each query.\n   - It also maintains two additional lists: `bin_storer` and `prefix_storer`. The `bin_storer` keeps track of cumulative sums of the Golomb numbers, while `prefix_storer` stores cumulative sums of the squares of the Golomb numbers.\n\n2. **Binary Search**:\n   - The function `find_upper_bound` is implemented to efficiently find the index in `bin_storer` that corresponds to the largest value less than or equal to a given key. This is crucial for quickly determining the range of indices that contribute to the sum of squares for any given query.\n\n3. **Query Handling**:\n   - The function `get_query` computes the adjusted sum of squares for a given upper limit using the precomputed `prefix_storer` and `bin_storer`. It calculates the surplus based on the difference between the actual value and the target, ensuring that the result is correctly adjusted modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n   - The `fire_query` function combines results from `get_query` for the lower and upper bounds of the query to get the final result.\n\n4. **Efficiency**:\n   - By precomputing values and using binary search, the solution significantly reduces the time complexity for each query, making it feasible to handle up to \\(10^5\\) queries efficiently, even with large values of \\(L\\) and \\(R\\).\n\nIn contrast, my initial approach involved recalculating the Golomb sequence for each query, which is inefficient given the constraints. The use of memoization was a step in the right direction, but it still did not match the efficiency of the official solution's precomputation and binary search strategy. This experience highlights the importance of precomputation and efficient data structures in competitive programming, especially when dealing with large input sizes.",
    "desc": "\n[description for function: solve]\nThis function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case specifies a range defined by two integers, L and R. It initializes a memoization dictionary to store previously computed values of the Golomb sequence. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the squares of the Golomb numbers for all integers in the specified range. The results are collected and printed in one go to optimize output performance. The final output is formatted to ensure it adheres to a specified modulo constraint. Overall, it efficiently computes and outputs the required sums for all test cases.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge about the Golomb sequence and its properties is useful in various scenarios, particularly in competitive programming and algorithm design. Understanding how to compute the Golomb sequence efficiently allows programmers to solve problems involving self-describing sequences, combinatorial counting, and dynamic programming. The ability to compute sums of squares over large ranges is also applicable in mathematical modeling, data analysis, and optimization problems where sequences play a crucial role. Additionally, the use of memoization to optimize recursive functions is a common technique in programming that can be applied to other problems as well."
