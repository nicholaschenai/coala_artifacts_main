The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof at the origin (0, 0) based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). \n\n    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.\n\n    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum. The approach was straightforward and worked well within the constraints provided. \n\n    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently handling input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. The solution utilized a linear search for counting walls, which was acceptable given the constraints, but could be optimized further with binary search if necessary. Overall, the solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls\n            index += 1\n        \n            walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions\n            index += 1\n        \n            Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                x_j, y_j = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read query coordinates\n                index += 1\n            \n                sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                # Check if the point lies on any wall\n                if sum_xy in walls:\n                    results.append(-1)\n                else:\n                    # Count how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                    count = 0\n                    for wall in walls:\n                        if wall > sum_xy:\n                            count += 1\n                    results.append(count)\n    \n        # Print all results for all queries\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    # Call the solve function to execute the code\n    solve()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies employed, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
