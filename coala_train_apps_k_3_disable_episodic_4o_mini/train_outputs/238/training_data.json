    "summary": "In this task, I was required to find the maximum profit from stock prices given over a series of days, allowing for at most two transactions. The core concept involved breaking down the problem into two parts: calculating the maximum profit from the first transaction and then the second transaction. This approach utilized dynamic programming to keep track of profits at each step.\n\nThe solution involved creating two arrays: `first_profit` to store the maximum profit achievable up to each day and `second_profit` to store the maximum profit achievable from each day onward. By iterating through the prices and updating these arrays, I was able to combine the results to find the overall maximum profit.\n\nThe final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key strategies that worked well included maintaining a running minimum and maximum price to efficiently calculate profits without needing nested loops, which would have increased the time complexity. This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and leveraging dynamic programming techniques for optimization. \n\nHere is the final code snippet for reference:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(prices)\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        first_profit = [0] * n\n        min_price = prices[0]\n        \n        for i in range(1, n):\n            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])\n            first_profit[i] = max(first_profit[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)\n        \n        second_profit = [0] * n\n        max_price = prices[-1]\n        \n        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])\n            second_profit[i] = max(second_profit[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])\n        \n        max_profit = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            max_profit = max(max_profit, first_profit[i] + second_profit[i])\n        \n        return max_profit\n```",
    "reflection": "The official solution to the problem of maximizing profit from stock prices with at most two transactions provides a clear and efficient approach. Here are the key insights and steps distilled from the official solution:\n\n1. **Two-Pass Approach**: The solution employs a two-pass strategy over the prices array. The first pass calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved from a single transaction starting from each day, while the second pass calculates the maximum profit from a single transaction ending at each day.\n\n2. **Right Maximum Profits**: In the first pass, the algorithm maintains an array `rmax_profits` that stores the maximum profit possible from the right side of the array (future days). It iterates backward through the prices, updating the maximum profit for each day based on the maximum price seen so far.\n\n3. **Left Minimum Prices**: In the second pass, the algorithm keeps track of the minimum price seen so far (`lmin`) and calculates the maximum profit that can be made by buying at that minimum price and selling on the current day. It then combines this profit with the maximum profit from the right side (using the `rmax_profits` array) to determine the total profit for that day.\n\n4. **Time Complexity**: The solution runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of days (length of the prices array), making it efficient for large inputs.\n\n5. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(n) due to the additional array used to store the right maximum profits.\n\nOverall, the official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that both transactions are accounted for without overlapping. This structured approach is beneficial for similar problems involving multiple transactions or stages. \n\nIn contrast, my initial solution also followed a two-pass approach but was more verbose and less efficient in terms of space usage. The official solution's use of a single array to track right maximum profits is a more elegant solution that minimizes space complexity while maintaining clarity.",
    "desc": "\n[description]\nThis function calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved from at most two transactions on a list of stock prices. It first computes the maximum profit possible from a single transaction up to each day, storing these values in an array. Then, it calculates the maximum profit possible from a single transaction starting from each day to the end, storing these results in another array. Finally, it combines the profits from both transactions to determine the overall maximum profit. The function returns this maximum profit value, ensuring that it accounts for the best possible buy and sell days across two transactions. If no transactions can be made, it returns zero.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where investors want to maximize their profits from stock trading with limited transactions. It can be applied in algorithmic trading, financial analysis, and investment strategy development. Understanding how to calculate maximum profit with constraints on transactions can help traders make informed decisions about when to buy and sell stocks, especially in volatile markets. Additionally, this algorithm can be adapted for similar problems in other domains, such as resource allocation and scheduling, where limited actions are allowed."
