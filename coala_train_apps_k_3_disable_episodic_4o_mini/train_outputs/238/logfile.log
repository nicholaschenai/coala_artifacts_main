## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:


Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have a list of stock prices where each element represents the price of a stock on a specific day. Our goal is to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two buy-sell transactions. We cannot buy stocks again until we have sold the previous ones.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can break it down into two main parts:
   - First, we will calculate the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction from the start of the list to each day.
   - Then, we will calculate the maximum profit we can achieve with one transaction from each day to the end of the list.
   - Finally, we will combine these two results to find the maximum profit we can achieve with two transactions by iterating through the days and summing the profits from the two parts.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function maxProfit(prices):
       if prices is empty:
           return 0
       
       n = length of prices
       create an array left_profit of size n
       create an array right_profit of size n
       
       // Calculate maximum profit for one transaction from the left
       min_price = prices[0]
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
           left_profit[i] = max(left_profit[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)
       
       // Calculate maximum profit for one transaction from the right
       max_price = prices[n-1]
       for i from n-1 down to 0:
           max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
           right_profit[i] = max(right_profit[i+1], max_price - prices[i])
       
       // Combine the results to find the maximum profit with two transactions
       max_profit = 0
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           max_profit = max(max_profit, left_profit[i] + right_profit[i])
       
       return max_profit
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the maximum number of chocolates Anushka can buy given a list of prices and a budget. The core concept involved sorting the prices to prioritize cheaper chocolates, allowing for the maximization of the quantity purchased within the budget constraints.

    The solution strategy was straightforward: sort the prices in ascending order, then iterate through the sorted list, keeping track of the total spent and the number of chocolates bought. The iteration stops when adding another chocolate's price would exceed the budget. This greedy approach effectively ensures that the maximum number of chocolates is purchased.

    The implementation was successful, with the provided code passing the sample test case. The key takeaway is the importance of sorting and a greedy algorithm in optimization problems involving budget constraints. The solution was efficient and adhered to the problem's constraints, demonstrating a clear understanding of the requirements. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def max_chocolates(n, k, prices):
        prices.sort()
        total_spent = 0
        chocolates_bought = 0
    
        for price in prices:
            if total_spent + price <= k:
                total_spent += price
                chocolates_bought += 1
            else:
                break
    
        return chocolates_bought

    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = max_chocolates(n, k, prices)
    print(result)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the effectiveness of sorting and greedy algorithms in solving optimization problems efficiently.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the maximum amount of money Mr. Krabs could collect from a series of rooms using a limited number of keys. The key concepts involved understanding the constraints of unlocking adjacent rooms and optimizing the collection of money from either end of the row of rooms.

    The solution utilized a greedy approach by calculating the total money collectible from both the leftmost and rightmost rooms, given the number of keys available. This involved iterating through the first `k` rooms from the left and the last `k` rooms from the right, then comparing the two totals to find the maximum.

    The final implementation was straightforward and efficient, handling the constraints well. The code successfully passed the provided test case, demonstrating that the approach was effective. The key takeaway was the importance of considering both ends of a linear structure when faced with constraints on access, which is a common pattern in similar optimization problems. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def max_money(n, A, k):
        left_money = 0
        right_money = 0
    
        # Calculate money collected from the left
        for i in range(min(k, n)):
            left_money += A[i]
    
        # Calculate money collected from the right
        for i in range(min(k, n)):
            right_money += A[n - 1 - i]
    
        # Compare the two scenarios
        return max(left_money, right_money)

    # Read input values
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k = int(input())

    # Call the function and print the result
    result = max_money(n, A, k)
    print(result)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the value of breaking down problems into manageable parts and considering multiple scenarios to find an optimal solution.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I implemented a solution to determine the minimum cost of train travel given specific travel days and ticket costs for different durations (1-day, 7-day, and 30-day passes). The problem required a dynamic programming approach to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each day of the year.

    The core concept involved creating a `dp` array where each index represented the minimum cost to cover travel days up to that day. For each travel day, I considered the cost of each type of pass and updated the `dp` array accordingly. The solution effectively handled the constraints of the problem, ensuring that all specified travel days were covered at the lowest possible expense.

    The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience was the importance of dynamic programming in optimizing solutions for problems involving overlapping subproblems, such as calculating costs over a range of days. The approach of using a set for quick lookup of travel days also proved to be efficient. 

    Here is the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
            dp = [float('inf')] * 366
            dp[0] = 0
            travel_days = set(days)

            for day in range(1, 366):
                if day in travel_days:
                    dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[day - 1] + costs[0])  # 1-day pass
                    dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1])  # 7-day pass
                    dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2])  # 30-day pass
                else:
                    dp[day] = dp[day - 1]

            return dp[365]
    ```

   The task is to determine the maximum profit that can be made from buying and selling a stock, given the prices of the stock over a series of days.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:


Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

Example 2:


Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


Example 3:


Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with:

INFO - [Task id] 238 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to determine the maximum profit that can be made from buying and selling a stock, given the prices of the stock over a series of days. You are allowed to make at most two transactions, meaning you can buy and sell the stock twice, but you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first transaction and the second transaction. We will keep track of the maximum profit that can be made from the first transaction up to each day, and then calculate the maximum profit that can be made from the second transaction starting from each day. By combining these two profits, we can find the maximum profit possible with two transactions.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Initialize an array first_profit to store the maximum profit from the first transaction up to each day
   Initialize an array second_profit to store the maximum profit from the second transaction starting from each day

   For each day i from 0 to n-1:
       Update first_profit[i] based on the minimum price seen so far and the current price

   For each day i from n-1 to 0:
       Update second_profit[i] based on the maximum price seen so far and the current price

   Initialize max_profit to 0
   For each day i from 0 to n-1:
       Update max_profit as the maximum of max_profit and the sum of first_profit[i] and second_profit[i]

   Return max_profit

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] In this task, I was required to find the maximum profit from stock prices given over a series of days, allowing for at most two transactions. The core concept involved breaking down the problem into two parts: calculating the maximum profit from the first transaction and then the second transaction. This approach utilized dynamic programming to keep track of profits at each step.

The solution involved creating two arrays: `first_profit` to store the maximum profit achievable up to each day and `second_profit` to store the maximum profit achievable from each day onward. By iterating through the prices and updating these arrays, I was able to combine the results to find the overall maximum profit.

The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key strategies that worked well included maintaining a running minimum and maximum price to efficiently calculate profits without needing nested loops, which would have increased the time complexity. This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and leveraging dynamic programming techniques for optimization. 

Here is the final code snippet for reference:

    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:

INFO - [Task id] 238 [generation text] The official solution to the problem of maximizing profit from stock prices with at most two transactions provides a clear and efficient approach. Here are the key insights and steps distilled from the official solution:

1. **Two-Pass Approach**: The solution employs a two-pass strategy over the prices array. The first pass calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved from a single transaction starting from each day, while the second pass calculates the maximum profit from a single transaction ending at each day.

2. **Right Maximum Profits**: In the first pass, the algorithm maintains an array `rmax_profits` that stores the maximum profit possible from the right side of the array (future days). It iterates backward through the prices, updating the maximum profit for each day based on the maximum price seen so far.

3. **Left Minimum Prices**: In the second pass, the algorithm keeps track of the minimum price seen so far (`lmin`) and calculates the maximum profit that can be made by buying at that minimum price and selling on the current day. It then combines this profit with the maximum profit from the right side (using the `rmax_profits` array) to determine the total profit for that day.

4. **Time Complexity**: The solution runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of days (length of the prices array), making it efficient for large inputs.

5. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(n) due to the additional array used to store the right maximum profits.

Overall, the official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that both transactions are accounted for without overlapping. This structured approach is beneficial for similar problems involving multiple transactions or stages. 

In contrast, my initial solution also followed a two-pass approach but was more verbose and less efficient in terms of space usage. The official solution's use of a single array to track right maximum profits is a more elegant solution that minimizes space complexity while maintaining clarity.

- Reason out, step by step, in what scenarios this knowledge would be useful.
- Focus on general patterns and situations to help connect this knowledge to new situations.
- Then, include a list of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair.

## Response format
Respond in JSON, and follow the keys and expected format of the values strictly.

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"scenarios": {"description": "In what scenarios will this knowledge be useful? Answer in a paragraph.", "title": "Scenarios", "type": "string"}, "keywords": {"description": "List of keywords that are useful for searching this problem/solution pair", "items": {"type": "string"}, "title": "Keywords", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["scenarios", "keywords"]}

[Problem]
    Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

    Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

    Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

    Example 1:


    Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
                 Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

    Example 2:


    Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
                 Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
                 engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


    Example 3:


    Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

[Solution]

    class Solution:
        def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:
            n = len(prices)
            if n == 0:
                return 0
        
            # Step 1: Calculate maximum profit for the first transaction
            first_profit = [0] * n
            min_price = prices[0]
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
                first_profit[i] = max(first_profit[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)
        
            # Step 2: Calculate maximum profit for the second transaction
            second_profit = [0] * n
            max_price = prices[-1]
        
            for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
                max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
                second_profit[i] = max(second_profit[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])
        
            # Step 3: Combine the profits from both transactions
            max_profit = 0
            for i in range(n):
                max_profit = max(max_profit, first_profit[i] + second_profit[i])
        
            return max_profit
