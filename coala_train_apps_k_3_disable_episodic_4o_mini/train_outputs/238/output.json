    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to determine the maximum profit that can be made from buying and selling a stock, given the prices of the stock over a series of days. You are allowed to make at most two transactions, meaning you can buy and sell the stock twice, but you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can break it down into two parts: the first transaction and the second transaction. We will keep track of the maximum profit that can be made from the first transaction up to each day, and then calculate the maximum profit that can be made from the second transaction starting from each day. By combining these two profits, we can find the maximum profit possible with two transactions.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize an array first_profit to store the maximum profit from the first transaction up to each day\n   Initialize an array second_profit to store the maximum profit from the second transaction starting from each day\n\n   For each day i from 0 to n-1:\n       Update first_profit[i] based on the minimum price seen so far and the current price\n\n   For each day i from n-1 to 0:\n       Update second_profit[i] based on the maximum price seen so far and the current price\n\n   Initialize max_profit to 0\n   For each day i from 0 to n-1:\n       Update max_profit as the maximum of max_profit and the sum of first_profit[i] and second_profit[i]\n\n   Return max_profit\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int]) -> int:\n        n = len(prices)\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        \n        # Step 1: Calculate maximum profit for the first transaction\n        first_profit = [0] * n\n        min_price = prices[0]\n        \n        for i in range(1, n):\n            min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])\n            first_profit[i] = max(first_profit[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)\n        \n        # Step 2: Calculate maximum profit for the second transaction\n        second_profit = [0] * n\n        max_price = prices[-1]\n        \n        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n            max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])\n            second_profit[i] = max(second_profit[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])\n        \n        # Step 3: Combine the profits from both transactions\n        max_profit = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            max_profit = max(max_profit, first_profit[i] + second_profit[i])\n        \n        return max_profit\n```",
