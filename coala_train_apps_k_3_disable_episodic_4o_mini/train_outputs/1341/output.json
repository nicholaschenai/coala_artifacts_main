    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The task is to find out how many ways we can remove a non-empty contiguous subsequence from a given sequence of integers such that the remaining sequence is non-empty and strictly increasing. We need to do this for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we need to identify all possible contiguous subsequences that can be removed from the sequence. After removing a subsequence, we need to check if the remaining elements form a strictly increasing sequence. A strictly increasing sequence means that each element is less than the next one. We can iterate through all possible starting and ending points of the subsequence to be removed and check the remaining sequence for the strictly increasing condition.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_ways_to_remove_subsequence(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           N = length of the sequence\n           A = the sequence of integers\n           count = 0\n           \n           for start in range(0, N):\n               for end in range(start, N):\n                   remaining_sequence = A[0:start] + A[end+1:N]\n                   if remaining_sequence is not empty and is_strictly_increasing(remaining_sequence):\n                       count += 1\n           \n           print(count)\n\n   function is_strictly_increasing(sequence):\n       for i from 1 to length of sequence:\n           if sequence[i] <= sequence[i-1]:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_strictly_increasing(sequence):\n    # Check if the given sequence is strictly increasing\n    for i in range(1, len(sequence)):\n        if sequence[i] <= sequence[i - 1]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef count_ways_to_remove_subsequence(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case[0]  # Length of the sequence\n        A = case[1]  # The sequence of integers\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over all possible starting points of the subsequence to remove\n        for start in range(N):\n            # Iterate over all possible ending points of the subsequence to remove\n            for end in range(start, N):\n                # Create the remaining sequence after removing the subsequence\n                remaining_sequence = A[0:start] + A[end + 1:N]\n                # Check if the remaining sequence is non-empty and strictly increasing\n                if remaining_sequence and is_strictly_increasing(remaining_sequence):\n                    count += 1\n        \n        # Print the count of valid ways for the current test case\n        print(count)\n\n# Read the number of test cases\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    test_cases.append((N, A))\n\ncount_ways_to_remove_subsequence(T, test_cases)\n```",
