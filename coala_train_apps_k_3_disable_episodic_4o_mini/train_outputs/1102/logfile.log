## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.

| PQRS | TUV | WXYZ |
+------+-----+------+
|      |  0  |      |
+------+-----+------+

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (10 points):
- 1 <= $|S|$ <= 10
Subtask #2 (90 points):
- Original Constraints

-----Sample Input:-----
2

5

72  

-----Sample Output:-----
3

12  

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Miu has a smartphone keypad where each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a set of letters. Given a string of digits, we need to determine how many different combinations of letters can be formed using those digits. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where each schedule consists of dishes served over N days with specific constraints. The key requirements were that no two consecutive days could serve the same dish, and the first and last days must serve different dishes.

    Initially, I derived a formula based on combinatorial reasoning, which was incorrect. The correct formula should have been \(4 \times 3^{(N-1)}\) for \(N \geq 2\). This accounts for:
    - 4 choices for the first day.
    - 3 choices for each subsequent day, including the last day, which must be different from the first.

    The main errors in my attempts included:
    1. Miscalculating the total schedules by incorrectly treating the last day as a separate case.
    2. Failing to properly implement the formula in the code, leading to incorrect outputs.

    The final working code correctly implements the formula and uses an efficient power function to handle large exponents modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The key takeaway is the importance of carefully analyzing constraints and ensuring that all conditions are accurately reflected in the mathematical model used for calculations. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def power(base, exp, mod):
        result = 1
        while exp > 0:
            if exp % 2 == 1:
                result = (result * base) % mod
            base = (base * base) % mod
            exp //= 2
        return result

    def calculate_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * power(3, N-1, MOD)) % MOD

    def main():
        T = int(input())
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            print(result)

    main()
    ``` 

    This experience highlighted the importance of validating mathematical models against problem constraints and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the derived formulas.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine how many rooms in two houses could be completely tiled using tiles from boxes, where each box contained a number of tiles equal to its index. The challenge involved ensuring that tiles from a single box were used to tile two rooms, one in each house, and that the total area of the rooms matched the number of tiles.

    The core concept revolved around checking pairs of rooms to see if their combined area equaled the number of tiles in an even-indexed box. The solution involved iterating through all boxes and checking all possible pairs of rooms, which could be computationally expensive given the constraints (up to \(10^{12}\) for N). 

    The initial approach was to use nested loops to check each box and room combination, but this would not scale well for large values of N. However, the provided solution worked correctly for smaller inputs, as evidenced by passing the sample test case.

    In future implementations, a more efficient algorithm would be necessary to handle larger values of N, possibly by leveraging mathematical properties of perfect squares or optimizing the search for room pairs. The final code snippet that worked for the sample input is as follows:

    ```python
    def count_tiled_rooms(N):
        total_rooms = 0
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                for j1 in range(1, N + 1):
                    for j2 in range(1, N + 1):
                        if j1 != j2 and j1 * j1 + j2 * j2 == i:
                            total_rooms += 2
                            break
        return total_rooms

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = count_tiled_rooms(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ``` 

    This summary highlights the problem-solving approach, the challenges faced, and the need for optimization in future attempts.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Miu has a smartphone with a keypad that allows her to search for contacts by typing digits. Each digit corresponds to a set of letters (like on old mobile phones). Given a string of digits, we need to find out how many different combinations of letters can be formed using those digits. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters:
     - 2 -> ABC (3 letters)
     - 3 -> DEF (3 letters)
     - 4 -> GHI (3 letters)
     - 5 -> JKL (3 letters)
     - 6 -> MNO (3 letters)
     - 7 -> PQRS (4 letters)
     - 8 -> TUV (3 letters)
     - 9 -> WXYZ (4 letters)
   - For each digit in the input string, we can determine how many letters it can represent.
   - The total number of combinations for the entire string can be calculated by multiplying the number of letters for each digit together.
   - Since the result can be large, we will take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Define a function count_combinations(S):
       Initialize a dictionary to map digits to their letter counts
       Initialize result to 1
       For each character in S:
           Convert character to integer
           Multiply result by the number of letters corresponding to that digit
           Take result modulo 10^9 + 7
       Return result

   Define a function solve():
       Read number of test cases T

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.
+------+-----+------+
|   1  |  2  |   3  |
|      | ABC |  DEF |
+------+-----+------+
|   4  |  5  |   6  |
|  GHI | JKL |  MNO |

| PQRS | TUV | WXYZ |
+------+-----+------+
|      |  0  |      |
+------+-----+------+

Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

-----Input:-----
- 
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
- 
Each test case consists of a string $S$.

-----Output:-----
- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

-----Constraints-----
- 
1 <= $T$ <= 10
- 
1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

-----EXPLANATION:-----
- 
Example Case 1:

On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
- 
Example Case 2:
On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:

    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] The problem involved calculating the number of possible letter combinations that can be formed from a string of digits based on a traditional mobile keypad mapping. Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a specific number of letters, and the task was to compute the product of these counts for each digit in the input string, returning the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The core concept tested was the understanding of mapping digits to their respective letter counts and efficiently calculating the product of these counts. The solution involved using a dictionary to store the mappings and iterating through the input string to compute the total combinations.

The implemented solution was straightforward and effective, utilizing basic arithmetic and modular operations to handle potentially large numbers. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution passed all test cases successfully. The final code efficiently handled the constraints, including the maximum length of the input string and multiple test cases. 

Key code snippet:
```python
def count_combinations(S):
    digit_to_count = {
        '2': 3, '3': 3, '4': 3, '5': 3, '6': 3,
        '7': 4, '8': 3, '9': 4
    }
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    result = 1
    for char in S:
        result = (result * digit_to_count[char]) % MOD
    return result
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding mappings and modular arithmetic in combinatorial problems.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for _ in range(int(input())):
 n=int(input())
 n1=0
 ans=1
 while(n>0):
  d=int(n % 10)
  if(d!=0):
   if(d!=9 and d!=7 and d!=1):

   else:
    n1=4
   ans=(int(ans)*int(n1))% (1000000007)
   n/=10
  else:
   n/=10
 if(ans==1):
  print("0")
 else:
  print(ans %(1000000007))


INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by iterating through each digit of the input number and calculating the number of possible letter combinations based on the digit's mapping. Here are the key insights from the official solution:

1. **Digit Mapping**: The solution uses a straightforward mapping for each digit:
   - Digits 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 correspond to 3 letters each.
   - Digits 7 and 9 correspond to 4 letters each.
   - Digit 1 corresponds to 1 letter (though it is not used in the context of this problem).
   - Digit 0 is ignored as it does not correspond to any letters.

2. **Iterative Calculation**: The solution processes each digit by:
   - Extracting the last digit using modulo operation.
   - Determining the number of letters for that digit.
   - Multiplying the current answer by the number of letters and taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution checks if the answer remains 1 after processing all digits, which indicates that no valid combinations were found (e.g., if the input was only zeros).

4. **Efficiency**: The solution operates in linear time relative to the number of digits, which is efficient given the constraints.

5. **Simplification**: The official solution simplifies the input handling by reading all input at once and processing it in a loop, which can be more efficient than handling each test case separately.

Overall, the official solution is effective in its approach, leveraging simple arithmetic and conditional checks to derive the result. It highlights the importance of understanding the mapping of digits to letters and efficiently iterating through the input to compute the result. This experience reinforces the value of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that edge cases are considered.

The main function is `solve`.
INFO - [Task id] 1102 [generation text] The function processes multiple test cases by reading a series of strings, each representing a sequence of digits. For each string, it calculates the total number of letter combinations that can be formed based on a mapping of digits to their corresponding letters on a phone keypad. It utilizes a predefined dictionary to determine how many letters each digit represents and multiplies these values together to get the total combinations. The results are computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers. Finally, it outputs the results for all test cases sequentially.

[Problem]
    On Miu's smart phone, there is a search feature which lets her search for a contact name by typing digits on the keypad where each digit may correspond to any of the characters given below it. For example, to search for TOM, she can type 866 and for MAX she can type 629.
    +------+-----+------+
    |   1  |  2  |   3  |
    |      | ABC |  DEF |
    +------+-----+------+
    |   4  |  5  |   6  |
    |  GHI | JKL |  MNO |
    +------+-----+------+
    |   7  |  8  |   9  |
    | PQRS | TUV | WXYZ |
    +------+-----+------+
    |      |  0  |      |
    +------+-----+------+

    Miu typed a random string of digits $S$ on the keypad while playing around, where each digit is between 2 and 9 inclusive. Now she wants to know the number of possible strings which would map to $S$. 
    Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7 (1000000007)

    -----Input:-----
    - 
    The first line of the input consists of a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
    - 
    Each test case consists of a string $S$.

    -----Output:-----
    - For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the count of all possible strings mod 1,000,000,007

    -----Constraints-----
    - 
    1 <= $T$ <= 10
    - 
    1 <= $|S|$ <= 105

    -----Subtasks-----
    Subtask #1 (10 points):
    - 1 <= $|S|$ <= 10
    Subtask #2 (90 points):
    - Original Constraints

    -----Sample Input:-----
    2

    5

    72  

    -----Sample Output:-----
    3

    12  

    -----EXPLANATION:-----
    - 
    Example Case 1:

    On the key 5, we have the character set JKL.

    Hence the possible strings are J,K,L.

    Hence the answer is 3 % (1000000007) = 3.  
    - 
    Example Case 2:
    On key 7, we have the character set PQRS.

    On key 2, we have the character set ABC.

    Hence the possible strings are PA,PB,PC,QA,QB,QC,RA,RB,RC,SA,SB,SC.

    Hence the answer is 12 % (1000000007) = 12.
