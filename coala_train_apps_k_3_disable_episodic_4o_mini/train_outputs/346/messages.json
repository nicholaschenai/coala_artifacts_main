The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted array of integers. The solution utilized a dynamic programming approach, which is a common strategy for problems involving subsequences. The key concept was to maintain an array that tracks the length of the LIS ending at each index, updating it based on previous elements.\n\n    The implemented algorithm iterated through the input array, comparing each element with all previous elements to determine if they could form an increasing subsequence. If they could, the length of the subsequence was updated accordingly. The final result was obtained by taking the maximum value from the array that tracked the lengths.\n\n    The code snippet for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            d = [1] * len(nums)\n        \n            for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This approach runs in O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem constraints. The solution was successful, passing all tests, indicating that the dynamic programming strategy was effective in this case. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    The problem involved calculating the number of unique results from the bitwise OR of all contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The key insight was that the bitwise OR operation accumulates values, meaning that once a new element is included in the subarray, the result can only stay the same or increase. This allowed for an efficient approach to compute results without recalculating the OR from scratch for overlapping subarrays.\n\n    The implemented solution involved iterating through each possible starting index of the subarray and then iterating through each possible ending index, updating the current OR value and storing it in a set to ensure uniqueness. This approach effectively captured all unique results.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: list[int]) -> int:\n            unique_results = set()\n            for i in range(len(A)):\n                current_or = 0\n                for j in range(i, len(A)):\n                    current_or |= A[j]\n                    unique_results.add(current_or)\n            return len(unique_results)\n    ```\n\n    The solution passed all test cases, indicating that the approach was effective and efficient for the problem constraints. No unexpected errors were encountered during the implementation.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This method is efficient and leverages combinatorial counting to derive the result, which is a key insight for solving this problem.\n\n### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n1. **Edge Counting**: The solution first iterates through the `nums` array to count the lengths of even subarrays that are found between odd numbers. Each time an odd number is encountered, the current count of even numbers is stored in a list called `edge`, and the count is reset.\n\n2. **Handling Insufficient Odds**: After populating the `edge` list, the solution checks if there are enough odd numbers (i.e., if the length of `edge` minus one is less than `k`). If there aren't enough odd numbers, it immediately returns 0.\n\n3. **Combination Calculation**: If there are enough odd numbers, the solution calculates the number of valid subarrays by multiplying the lengths of the even segments that are adjacent to the `k` odd numbers. This is done using a simple loop that iterates through the `edge` list and accumulates the product of the lengths of the even segments that are `k` positions apart.\n\n### Comparison with My Approach:\n\n- My approach used a sliding window technique, which is intuitive but may not be as efficient in terms of space and time complexity as the official solution. The official solution effectively reduces the problem to counting combinations of segments, which is a more direct method for this specific problem.\n\n- The official solution avoids the need for nested loops and maintains a linear time complexity, while my approach could potentially involve more overhead due to the management of the sliding window and additional checks.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe official solution's method of counting even segments between odd numbers and using combinatorial logic to derive the result is a more elegant and efficient approach. This experience highlights the importance of considering different strategies for counting problems, especially those involving combinations and subarrays."
