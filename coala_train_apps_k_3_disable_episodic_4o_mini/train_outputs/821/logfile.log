## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We have multiple test cases, each containing a set of intervals on the X-axis. Our goal is to color each interval either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the X-axis that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. We need to output a string for each test case where '0' represents a blue interval and '1' represents a yellow interval.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, we can color one blue and the other yellow to create a green area. If an interval does not overlap with any other, we can color it either blue or yellow without affecting the green area. The strategy will involve sorting the intervals and checking for overlaps to decide the coloring.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read number of intervals n
           read intervals into a list
           sort intervals by their starting point
           initialize a result string of length n with '0's
           for i from 0 to n-1:
               if current interval overlaps with the previous one:
                   color current interval yellow (result[i] = '1')
               else:
                   color current interval blue (result[i] = '0')
           output the result string

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_contests(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.

    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.

    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.

    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Read number of boxes and capacity of each box
            ducks = case[2]  # Read the list of duck counts
            boxes = []  # This will hold the distribution of ducks in each box
        
            # Create a list of colors with their counts
            color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]
        
            # Fill each box
            for _ in range(N):
                m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box
                c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box
            
                # Try to fill the box with ducks
                for i in range(len(color_counts)):
                    if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full
                        if color_counts[i][1] > 0:  # If there are ducks of this color
                            if c1 == -1:  # First color
                                c1 = color_counts[i][0]
                                m1 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible

                print(box[0], box[1], box[2], box[3])
    ``` 

    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the challenges faced, and the final solution that met all requirements.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.

    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. 

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one of the two colors, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, coloring one blue and the other yellow will contribute to the green area. We can sort the intervals based on their starting points and then iterate through them to determine overlaps. If an interval overlaps with the previous one, we can color them in a way that maximizes the green area. If they do not overlap, we can color them in a way that does not affect the green area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read number of intervals n
           read intervals L and R
           sort intervals by L
           initialize result as an empty string
           for i from 0 to n-1:
               if current interval overlaps with previous:
                   color current interval yellow
                   color previous interval blue
                   add '1' to result for yellow and '0' for blue
               else:
                   color current interval blue
                   add '0' to result
           print result
   ```

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one of the two colors, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, coloring one blue and the other yellow will contribute to the green area. We can sort the intervals based on their starting points and then iterate through them to determine overlaps. If an interval overlaps with the previous one, we can color them in a way that maximizes the green area. If they do not overlap, we can color them in a way that does not affect the green area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read number of intervals n
           read intervals L and R

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the green area, which occurs when at least one interval is colored blue and at least one is colored yellow. The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The current implementation checks for overlaps and colors the intervals based on that. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. The logic only colors the last interval blue and the current one yellow, which may not maximize the green area.
   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '001', which indicates that the last interval was incorrectly colored.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was too simplistic. It only considered the last colored interval and did not account for the possibility of multiple overlapping intervals needing to be colored differently to maximize the green area.
   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the code, we need to:
- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.
- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.
- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read number of intervals n
        read intervals L and R
        sort intervals by L
        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            if current interval overlaps with any previous:
                color current interval yellow
                color overlapping intervals blue
            else:
                color current interval blue
        print result as a string
```

### Final Python 3 Solution:
```python
def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for intervals in test_cases:
        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals
        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals
        # Sort intervals based on their starting point
        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))
        
        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue
        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval
        
        for i in range(n):
            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]
            if L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap
                result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow
                # Color the previous interval blue if it was not already colored
                if result[index - 1] == '0':
                    result[index - 1] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue
            last_end = max(last_end, R)  # Update the last end
        
        print(''.join(result))  # Output the result for the test case

# Read input
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    intervals = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one of the two colors, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, coloring one blue and the other yellow will contribute to the green area. We can sort the intervals based on their starting points and then iterate through them to determine overlaps. If an interval overlaps with the previous one, we can color them in a way that maximizes the green area. If they do not overlap, we can color them in a way that does not affect the green area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read number of intervals n
           read intervals L and R
           sort intervals by L
           initialize result as an empty string
           for i from 0 to n-1:
               if current interval overlaps with previous:
                   color current interval yellow
                   color previous interval blue
                   add '1' to result for yellow and '0' for blue
               else:
                   color current interval blue
                   add '0' to result

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the green area, which occurs when at least one interval is colored blue and at least one is colored yellow. The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The current implementation checks for overlaps and colors the intervals based on that. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. The logic only colors the last interval blue and the current one yellow, which may not maximize the green area.
   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '001', which indicates that the last interval was incorrectly colored.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was too simplistic. It only considered the last colored interval and did not account for the possibility of multiple overlapping intervals needing to be colored differently to maximize the green area.
   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the code, we need to:
- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.
- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.
- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read number of intervals n
        read intervals L and R
        sort intervals by L
        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            if current interval overlaps with any previous:
                color current interval yellow
                color overlapping intervals blue
            else:
                color current interval blue
        print result as a string
```

### Final Python 3 Solution:
```python
def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for intervals in test_cases:
        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals
        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals
        # Sort intervals based on their starting point
        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))
        
        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue
        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval
        
        for i in range(n):
            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]
            if L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap
                result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow
                # Color the previous interval blue if it was not already colored
                if result[index - 1] == '0':
                    result[index - 1] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue
            last_end = max(last_end, R)  # Update the last end
        
        print(''.join(result))  # Output the result for the test case

# Read input

    intervals = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.

    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.

    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.

    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Read number of boxes and capacity of each box
            ducks = case[2]  # Read the list of duck counts
            boxes = []  # This will hold the distribution of ducks in each box
        
            # Create a list of colors with their counts
            color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]
        
            # Fill each box
            for _ in range(N):
                m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box
                c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box
            
                # Try to fill the box with ducks
                for i in range(len(color_counts)):
                    if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full
                        if color_counts[i][1] > 0:  # If there are ducks of this color
                            if c1 == -1:  # First color
                                c1 = color_counts[i][0]
                                m1 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible
                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m1)  # Update count
                            elif c2 == -1:  # Second color
                                c2 = color_counts[i][0]
                                m2 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible
                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m2)  # Update count
            
                # If we have only one color, ensure the other is set to 0
                if c2 == -1:
                    c2 = 0
                    m2 = 0

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_contests(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of alternating '1's and '0's based on an integer input \( K \) for multiple test cases. The pattern required printing \( K \) lines for each test case, where each line \( i \) contains \( i \) characters.

    The solution involved iterating through each test case and constructing the required lines by checking the index of each character to determine whether to append '1' or '0'. The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided.

    One key aspect was ensuring that the output format matched the expected results, which involved printing each line immediately after constructing it. The solution was efficient and adhered to the problem's requirements without any external libraries.

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
        for K in test_cases:
            for i in range(1, K + 1):
                line = ""
                for j in range(i):
                    if j % 2 == 0:
                        line += "1"
                    else:
                        line += "0"
                print(line)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]
    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully managing output formatting and the utility of nested loops for generating patterns based on incremental conditions.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one of the two colors, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, coloring one blue and the other yellow will contribute to the green area. We can sort the intervals based on their starting points and then iterate through them to determine overlaps. If an interval overlaps with the previous one, we can color them in a way that maximizes the green area. If they do not overlap, we can color them in a way that does not affect the green area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read number of intervals n
           read intervals L and R
           sort intervals by L
           initialize result as an empty string
           for i from 0 to n-1:
               if current interval overlaps with previous:
                   color current interval yellow
                   color previous interval blue
                   add '1' to result for yellow and '0' for blue
               else:
                   color current interval blue
                   add '0' to result

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the green area, which occurs when at least one interval is colored blue and at least one is colored yellow. The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The current implementation checks for overlaps and colors the intervals based on that. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. The logic only colors the last interval blue and the current one yellow, which may not maximize the green area.
   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '001', which indicates that the last interval was incorrectly colored.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was too simplistic. It only considered the last colored interval and did not account for the possibility of multiple overlapping intervals needing to be colored differently to maximize the green area.
   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the code, we need to:
- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.
- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.
- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read number of intervals n
        read intervals L and R
        sort intervals by L
        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            if current interval overlaps with any previous:
                color current interval yellow
                color overlapping intervals blue
            else:
                color current interval blue
        print result as a string
```

### Final Python 3 Solution:
```python
def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for intervals in test_cases:
        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals
        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals
        # Sort intervals based on their starting point
        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))
        
        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue
        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval
        
        for i in range(n):
            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]
            if L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap
                result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow
                # Color the previous interval blue if it was not already colored
                if result[index - 1] == '0':
                    result[index - 1] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue
            last_end = max(last_end, R)  # Update the last end

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Here is the corrected Python code that addresses the problem of maximizing the green area by properly coloring the intervals. The logic has been revised to ensure that overlapping intervals are handled correctly, allowing for optimal coloring.

        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals
        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals
        # Sort intervals based on their starting point
        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))
        
        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue
        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval
        
        for i in range(n):
            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]
            if L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap
                result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow

    intervals = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    test_cases.append((n, intervals))

maximize_green_intervals(test_cases)
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted based on their starting points to facilitate overlap checking.
2. **Overlap Handling**: The logic now checks for overlaps correctly and colors the intervals accordingly.
3. **Result Initialization**: The result list is initialized to all '0's (blue) and updated based on the overlap conditions.

This code should now correctly maximize the green area by ensuring that overlapping intervals are colored in a way that contributes to the green area.

You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one of the two colors, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, coloring one blue and the other yellow will contribute to the green area. We can sort the intervals based on their starting points and then iterate through them to determine overlaps. If an interval overlaps with the previous one, we can color them in a way that maximizes the green area. If they do not overlap, we can color them in a way that does not affect the green area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read number of intervals n
           read intervals L and R

                   color current interval yellow
                   color previous interval blue
                   add '1' to result for yellow and '0' for blue
               else:
                   color current interval blue
                   add '0' to result

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the green area, which occurs when at least one interval is colored blue and at least one is colored yellow. The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The current implementation checks for overlaps and colors the intervals based on that. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. The logic only colors the last interval blue and the current one yellow, which may not maximize the green area.
   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '001', which indicates that the last interval was incorrectly colored.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was too simplistic. It only considered the last colored interval and did not account for the possibility of multiple overlapping intervals needing to be colored differently to maximize the green area.
   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the code, we need to:
- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.
- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.
- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read number of intervals n
        read intervals L and R
        sort intervals by L
        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            if current interval overlaps with any previous:
                color current interval yellow
                color overlapping intervals blue
            else:
                color current interval blue
        print result as a string
```

### Final Python 3 Solution:
```python
def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for intervals in test_cases:
        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals
        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals
        # Sort intervals based on their starting point
        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))
        
        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue
        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval
        
        for i in range(n):
            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]
            if L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap
                result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow
                # Color the previous interval blue if it was not already colored
                if result[index - 1] == '0':
                    result[index - 1] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue
            last_end = max(last_end, R)  # Update the last end

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Here is the corrected Python code that addresses the problem of maximizing the green area by properly coloring the intervals. The logic has been revised to ensure that overlapping intervals are handled correctly, allowing for optimal coloring.

```python
def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted based on their starting points to facilitate overlap checking.
2. **Overlap Handling**: The logic now checks for overlaps correctly and colors the intervals accordingly.
3. **Result Initialization**: The result list is initialized to all '0's (blue) and updated based on the overlap conditions.

This code should now correctly maximize the green area by ensuring that overlapping intervals are colored in a way that contributes to the green area.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.

    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.

    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.

    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges.

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input \( K \) for multiple test cases. The expected output required alternating lines of numbers, where even-indexed lines counted up from `0` to the line index, and odd-indexed lines counted down from the line index to `0`.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Pattern Recognition**: The output pattern alternates between counting up and counting down based on the line index. This was a crucial aspect that needed to be correctly implemented to match the expected output.
    2. **Logic Implementation**: The initial attempts incorrectly generated lines by not adhering to the specified counting logic. The correct approach involved checking if the line index was even or odd and generating the line accordingly.

    ### Code Snippet:
    The final corrected code that adheres to the requirements is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):

                        line += str(j)

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]
    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
    ```

    ### Lessons Learned:
    - It is essential to carefully analyze the output requirements and ensure that the logic implemented matches those requirements.
    - Alternating patterns can often lead to confusion; clear separation of logic for different cases (even vs. odd) is necessary to avoid errors.
    - Testing with various inputs can help identify edge cases and ensure the robustness of the solution.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] Based on the insights gained from previous attempts and the understanding of the problem, I will revise the solution to ensure that the intervals are colored optimally to maximize the green area. The key is to ensure that overlapping intervals are handled correctly and that we alternate colors appropriately.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the intervals** based on their starting points.
2. **Iterate through the sorted intervals** and check for overlaps.
3. **Color the intervals** such that overlapping intervals contribute to the green area by ensuring at least one is blue and one is yellow.

### Final Python 3 Solution:
```python
def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for intervals in test_cases:
        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals
        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals
        # Sort intervals based on their starting point
        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))
        
        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue
        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval
        colored = []  # To keep track of colored intervals
        
        for i in range(n):
            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]
            if colored and L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap
                # Color the current interval yellow
                result[index] = '1'
                # Color the last colored interval blue if it was not already colored
                if result[colored[-1]] == '0':
                    result[colored[-1]] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue
            else:
                # No overlap, color current interval blue
                result[index] = '0'
            
            # Update the last end and add the current index to colored
            last_end = max(last_end, R)
            colored.append(index)
        
        print(''.join(result))  # Output the result for the test case

# Read input
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):

    intervals = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    test_cases.append((n, intervals))

maximize_green_intervals(test_cases)
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted based on their starting points to facilitate overlap checking.
2. **Overlap Handling**: The logic now checks for overlaps correctly and colors the intervals accordingly.
3. **Result Initialization**: The result list is initialized to all '0's (blue) and updated based on the overlap conditions.

This code should now correctly handle the coloring of intervals to maximize the green area.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one of the two colors, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, coloring one blue and the other yellow will contribute to the green area. We can sort the intervals based on their starting points and then iterate through them to determine overlaps. If an interval overlaps with the previous one, we can color them in a way that maximizes the green area. If they do not overlap, we can color them in a way that does not affect the green area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read number of intervals n
           read intervals L and R
           sort intervals by L
           initialize result as an empty string
           for i from 0 to n-1:
               if current interval overlaps with previous:
                   color current interval yellow
                   color previous interval blue
                   add '1' to result for yellow and '0' for blue
               else:
                   color current interval blue
                   add '0' to result
           print result

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the green area, which occurs when at least one interval is colored blue and at least one is colored yellow. The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The current implementation checks for overlaps and colors the intervals based on that. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. The logic only colors the last interval blue and the current one yellow, which may not maximize the green area.
   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '001', which indicates that the last interval was incorrectly colored.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was too simplistic. It only considered the last colored interval and did not account for the possibility of multiple overlapping intervals needing to be colored differently to maximize the green area.
   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the code, we need to:
- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.
- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.
- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read number of intervals n
        read intervals L and R
        sort intervals by L
        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            if current interval overlaps with any previous:
                color current interval yellow
                color overlapping intervals blue
            else:
                color current interval blue
        print result as a string
```

### Final Python 3 Solution:
```python
def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for intervals in test_cases:
        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals
        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals
        # Sort intervals based on their starting point
        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))
        
        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue
        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval
        
        for i in range(n):
            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]
            if L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap
                result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow
                # Color the previous interval blue if it was not already colored
                if result[index - 1] == '0':
                    result[index - 1] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue

1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted based on their starting points to facilitate overlap checking.
2. **Overlap Handling**: The logic now checks for overlaps correctly and colors the intervals accordingly.
3. **Result Initialization**: The result list is initialized to all '0's (blue) and updated based on the overlap conditions.

This code should now correctly maximize the green area by ensuring that overlapping intervals are colored in a way that contributes to the green area.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the green area, which occurs when at least one interval is colored blue and at least one is colored yellow. The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The current implementation attempts to color intervals based on overlaps, but it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. Specifically, it does not ensure that the intervals are colored in a way that maximizes the green area.
   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '101', which indicates that both the first and second intervals were incorrectly colored.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was flawed. The code only checks if the current interval overlaps with the last colored interval, which is not sufficient. It should consider all previous intervals to determine the best coloring strategy.
   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the code, we need to:
- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.
- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.
- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read number of intervals n
        read intervals L and R
        sort intervals by L
        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            if current interval overlaps with any previous:
                color current interval yellow
                color overlapping intervals blue
            else:
                color current interval blue
        print result as a string
```

### Final Python 3 Solution:
```python
def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for intervals in test_cases:
        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals
        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals

        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue
        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval
        colored_intervals = []  # To keep track of colored intervals
        
        for i in range(n):
            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]
            if colored_intervals and L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap

                result[index] = '1'
                # Color the last colored interval blue if it was not already colored
                if result[colored_intervals[-1]] == '0':
                    result[colored_intervals[-1]] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue
            else:
                # No overlap, color current interval blue
                result[index] = '0'

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one of the two colors, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, coloring one blue and the other yellow will contribute to the green area. We can sort the intervals based on their starting points and then iterate through them to determine overlaps. If an interval overlaps with the previous one, we can color them in a way that maximizes the green area. If they do not overlap, we can color them in a way that does not affect the green area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read number of intervals n
           read intervals L and R
           sort intervals by L
           initialize result as an empty string
           for i from 0 to n-1:
               if current interval overlaps with previous:
                   color current interval yellow
                   color previous interval blue
                   add '1' to result for yellow and '0' for blue
               else:
                   color current interval blue
                   add '0' to result

   - The current implementation checks for overlaps and colors the intervals based on that. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. The logic only colors the last interval blue and the current one yellow, which may not maximize the green area.
   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '001', which indicates that the last interval was incorrectly colored.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was too simplistic. It only considered the last colored interval and did not account for the possibility of multiple overlapping intervals needing to be colored differently to maximize the green area.
   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the code, we need to:
- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.
- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.
- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read number of intervals n
        read intervals L and R
        sort intervals by L
        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            if current interval overlaps with any previous:
                color current interval yellow
                color overlapping intervals blue
            else:
                color current interval blue
        print result as a string
```

### Final Python 3 Solution:
```python
def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for intervals in test_cases:
        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals
        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals
        # Sort intervals based on their starting point
        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))
        
        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue
        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval
        
        for i in range(n):
            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]
            if L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap
                result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow
                # Color the previous interval blue if it was not already colored
                if result[index - 1] == '0':
                    result[index - 1] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue
            last_end = max(last_end, R)  # Update the last end
        
        print(''.join(result))  # Output the result for the test case

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_contests(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.

    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.

    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.

    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):

            # Create a list of colors with their counts
            color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]

            for _ in range(N):
                m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box
                c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box
            
                # Try to fill the box with ducks
                for i in range(len(color_counts)):
                    if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input \( K \) for multiple test cases. The expected output required alternating lines of numbers, where even-indexed lines counted up from `0` to the line index, and odd-indexed lines counted down from the line index to `0`.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Pattern Recognition**: The output pattern alternates between counting up and counting down based on the line index. This was a crucial aspect that needed to be correctly implemented to match the expected output.
    2. **Logic Implementation**: The initial attempts incorrectly generated lines by not adhering to the specified counting logic. The correct approach involved checking if the line index was even or odd and generating the line accordingly.

    ### Code Snippet:
    The final corrected code that adheres to the requirements is as follows:

    ```python
    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):
        for K in test_cases:
            for i in range(K):
                line = ""
                if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index: count up from 0 to i
                    for j in range(i + 1):
                        line += str(j)
                else:  # Odd index: count down from i to 0
                    for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                        line += str(j)
                print(line)

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]
    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)
    ```

    ### Lessons Learned:
    - It is essential to carefully analyze the output requirements and ensure that the logic implemented matches those requirements.
    - Alternating patterns can often lead to confusion; clear separation of logic for different cases (even vs. odd) is necessary to avoid errors.
    - Testing with various inputs can help identify edge cases and ensure the robustness of the solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] Given the previous insights and the understanding of the problem, I will revise the solution to ensure that the intervals are colored optimally to maximize the green area. The key is to ensure that overlapping intervals are handled correctly and that we alternate colors appropriately.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the intervals** based on their starting points.
2. **Iterate through the sorted intervals** and check for overlaps.
3. **Color the intervals** such that overlapping intervals contribute to the green area by ensuring at least one is blue and one is yellow.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one of the two colors, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, coloring one blue and the other yellow will contribute to the green area. We can sort the intervals based on their starting points and then iterate through them to determine overlaps. If an interval overlaps with the previous one, we can color them in a way that maximizes the green area. If they do not overlap, we can color them in a way that does not affect the green area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read number of intervals n
           read intervals L and R

           initialize result as an empty string
           for i from 0 to n-1:
               if current interval overlaps with previous:
                   color current interval yellow
                   color previous interval blue
                   add '1' to result for yellow and '0' for blue
               else:

                   add '0' to result

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the green area, which occurs when at least one interval is colored blue and at least one is colored yellow. The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The current implementation checks for overlaps and colors the intervals based on that. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. The logic only colors the last interval blue and the current one yellow, which may not maximize the green area.
   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '001', which indicates that the last interval was incorrectly colored.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was too simplistic. It only considered the last colored interval and did not account for the possibility of multiple overlapping intervals needing to be colored differently to maximize the green area.
   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the code, we need to:
- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.
- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.
- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read number of intervals n
        read intervals L and R
        sort intervals by L
        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            if current interval overlaps with any previous:
                color current interval yellow
                color overlapping intervals blue
            else:
                color current interval blue
        print result as a string
```

### Final Python 3 Solution:
```python
def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for intervals in test_cases:
        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals
        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals

        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))
        
        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue
        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval
        
        for i in range(n):
            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted based on their starting points to facilitate overlap checking.
2. **Overlap Handling**: The logic now checks for overlaps correctly and colors the intervals accordingly.
3. **Result Initialization**: The result list is initialized to all '0's (blue) and updated based on the overlap conditions.

This code should now correctly maximize the green area by ensuring that overlapping intervals are colored in a way that contributes to the green area.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the green area, which occurs when at least one interval is colored blue and at least one is colored yellow. The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The current implementation attempts to color intervals based on overlaps, but it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. Specifically, it does not ensure that the intervals are colored in a way that maximizes the green area.
   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '101', which indicates that both the first and second intervals were incorrectly colored.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was flawed. The code only checks if the current interval overlaps with the last colored interval, which is not sufficient. It should consider all previous intervals to determine the best coloring strategy.
   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the code, we need to:
- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.
- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.
- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read number of intervals n
        read intervals L and R
        sort intervals by L
        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            if current interval overlaps with any previous:
                color current interval yellow
                color overlapping intervals blue
            else:
                color current interval blue
        print result as a string
```

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow to maximize the length of the area colored green, which occurs when both colors overlap. The challenge was to determine the optimal coloring strategy for potentially overlapping intervals.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Interval Overlap**: The core concept was to identify overlapping intervals and color them in a way that maximizes the green area. This required careful tracking of the intervals' endpoints and their relationships.
2. **Sorting**: Sorting the intervals by their starting points was essential for efficiently checking overlaps and determining the correct coloring order.

### Strategies Attempted:
- The initial approach involved sorting the intervals and checking for overlaps with the last colored interval. However, this led to incorrect results because it did not account for multiple overlapping intervals effectively.
- The logic was revised to maintain a list of colored intervals and ensure that when overlaps were detected, at least one interval was colored blue and another yellow. Despite these adjustments, the output still did not match the expected results.

### Errors and Fixes:
- The main error was in the overlap handling logic, which did not correctly alternate colors for overlapping intervals. The solution needed a more comprehensive strategy to ensure that all overlapping intervals contributed to the green area.
- The final solution still produced incorrect outputs, indicating that further refinement of the overlap detection and coloring logic was necessary.

### Conclusion:
This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing state when dealing with overlapping intervals and the need for a robust strategy to ensure optimal coloring. Future attempts should focus on a more systematic approach to handle multiple overlaps and ensure that the coloring maximizes the green area effectively.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You are given $n$ intervals on the $X$ axis. Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:
- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval
- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.
- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.
- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.
You want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.

-----Input:-----
- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.
- The $i^{\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval.

-----Output:-----
For each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.

-----Constraints-----
- $ 1 \leq T \leq 10^5 $
- $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 $
- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
- $ 1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \leq i \leq n$.

-----Sample Input:-----
1
3
3 7
2 5
6 9

-----Sample Output:-----
100

-----Explanation:-----
The intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:
- $[2, 3) \cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.
- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.
- $[3, 5] \cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.
- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.
Please note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.
Note that 011 is also a valid output.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

1. Restate the problem in plain English

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one of the two colors, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, coloring one blue and the other yellow will contribute to the green area. We can sort the intervals based on their starting points and then iterate through them to determine overlaps. If an interval overlaps with the previous one, we can color them in a way that maximizes the green area. If they do not overlap, we can color them in a way that does not affect the green area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):

           read number of intervals n
           read intervals L and R

               if current interval overlaps with previous:
                   color current interval yellow
                   color previous interval blue
                   add '1' to result for yellow and '0' for blue

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 821 [prompt] Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the green area, which occurs when at least one interval is colored blue and at least one is colored yellow. The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   - The current implementation checks for overlaps and colors the intervals based on that. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. The logic only colors the last interval blue and the current one yellow, which may not maximize the green area.
   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '001', which indicates that the last interval was incorrectly colored.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was too simplistic. It only considered the last colored interval and did not account for the possibility of multiple overlapping intervals needing to be colored differently to maximize the green area.
   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the code, we need to:
- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.
- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.
- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.

### Revised Pseudocode:
```
function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for each test_case in test_cases:
        read number of intervals n
        read intervals L and R
        sort intervals by L
        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's
        for i from 0 to n-1:
            if current interval overlaps with any previous:
                color current interval yellow
                color overlapping intervals blue
            else:
                color current interval blue
        print result as a string
```

### Final Python 3 Solution:
```python
def maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):
    for intervals in test_cases:
        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals
        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals
        # Sort intervals based on their starting point
        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))
        
        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue
        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval
        
        for i in range(n):
            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]
            if L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap
                result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow
                # Color the previous interval blue if it was not already colored
                if result[index - 1] == '0':
                    result[index - 1] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue
            last_end = max(last_end, R)  # Update the last end

- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

INFO - [Task id] 821 [generation text] ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

In my attempts to solve the problem of maximizing the green area by coloring intervals, I encountered several challenges that ultimately led to incorrect outputs. The primary issue was in the logic used to determine how to color overlapping intervals. My approach focused on checking overlaps with only the last colored interval, which was insufficient for correctly managing multiple overlapping intervals. This resulted in incorrect color assignments, as seen in the test case where the expected output was '100', but my solution produced '101'.

The official solution provided a more effective approach by maintaining separate lists for the left and right endpoints of the intervals, as well as a combined list of tuples that included the original indices. This allowed for a clear sorting of intervals based on their starting points. The key steps in the official solution include:

1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted based on their starting points, which simplifies the overlap checking process.
2. **Coloring Logic**: The solution uses a counter (`c`) to alternate colors based on the conditions of overlap. If the current interval starts after the maximum right endpoint seen so far, it is colored with the current color. If it overlaps with the maximum right endpoint, it is colored with the opposite color.
3. **Efficient Updates**: The maximum right endpoint (`maxi`) is updated as needed, allowing for efficient management of overlapping intervals.

This structured approach not only simplifies the logic but also ensures that all intervals are considered correctly, leading to the desired output. The use of bitwise operations for toggling colors is also a clever optimization that reduces the need for additional condition checks.

In summary, the official solution's method of sorting and systematically managing overlaps through a clear set of rules proved to be more robust than my initial attempts. This experience highlights the importance of considering all relevant intervals when dealing with overlaps and the value of a well-structured approach to problem-solving.
INFO - Updated entry: In this problem, the goal was to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow to maximize the length of the area colored green, which occurs when both colors overlap. The challenge was to determine the optimal coloring strategy for potentially overlapping intervals.
