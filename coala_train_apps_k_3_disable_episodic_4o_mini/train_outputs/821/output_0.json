    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The task is to color a set of intervals on the X-axis either blue or yellow in such a way that the total length of the area that is colored green (where both blue and yellow intervals overlap) is maximized. Each interval can only be colored one of the two colors, and we need to determine the optimal coloring for multiple test cases.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To maximize the green area, we should look for overlaps between intervals. If two intervals overlap, coloring one blue and the other yellow will contribute to the green area. We can sort the intervals based on their starting points and then iterate through them to determine overlaps. If an interval overlaps with the previous one, we can color them in a way that maximizes the green area. If they do not overlap, we can color them in a way that does not affect the green area.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read number of intervals n\n           read intervals L and R\n           sort intervals by L\n           initialize result as an empty string\n           for i from 0 to n-1:\n               if current interval overlaps with previous:\n                   color current interval yellow\n                   color previous interval blue\n                   add '1' to result for yellow and '0' for blue\n               else:\n                   color current interval blue\n                   add '0' to result\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals\n        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals\n        # Sort intervals based on their starting point\n        intervals_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        \n        result = []\n        last_color = None  # To keep track of the last colored interval\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            L, R = intervals_list[i]\n            if last_color is not None and last_color[1] > L:  # Check for overlap\n                # If overlapping, color the last one blue and current one yellow\n                result[last_color[2]] = '0'  # Last colored blue\n                result.append('1')  # Current colored yellow\n                last_color = (L, R, len(result) - 1)  # Update last color\n            else:\n                # No overlap, color current interval blue\n                result.append('0')  # Current colored blue\n                last_color = (L, R, len(result) - 1)  # Update last color\n        \n        print(''.join(result))  # Output the result for the test case\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    intervals = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n    test_cases.append((n, intervals))\n\nmaximize_green_intervals(test_cases)\n```",
