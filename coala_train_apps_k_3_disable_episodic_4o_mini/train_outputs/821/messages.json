Each interval $i$ is specified by its ends $[L_i, R_i]$. You want to color each interval either blue or yellow. After coloring all the intervals, the $X$ axis will will have $4$ colors:\n- White, the part of $X$ axis contained in no interval\n- Blue, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one blue colored interval and no yellow colored interval.\n- Yellow, the part of $X$ axis contained in atleast one yellow colored interval and no blue colored interval.\n- Green, the part of $X$ axis contained in at least one blue colored interval and at least one yellow colored interval.\nYou want to color the intervals so that the total length of the part colored green is maximized. If there are multiple ways to color which maximize the green part, you can output any of them.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- The first line of each testcase contains $n$, the number of intervals.\n- The $i^{\\text{th}}$ of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ describing the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each testcase, output a single string on a new line, whose $i^{\\text{th}}$ character is $0$ if you color the $i^{\\text{th}}$ interval blue, and $1$ if you color it yellow.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $ 1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5 $\n- $ 1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $\n- The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $10^5$.\n- $ 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^9 $ for al $ 1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n3\n3 7\n2 5\n6 9\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n100\n\n-----Explanation:-----\nThe intervals are $[3, 7]$, $[2, 5]$, $[6, 9]$. It is optimal to color them in yellow, blue and blue respectively. In this coloring:\n- $[2, 3) \\cup (7, 9]$ is colored blue.\n- $(5, 6)$ is colored yellow.\n- $[3, 5] \\cup [6, 7]$ is colored green, with a total length of $(5 - 3) + (7 - 6) = 3$.\n- Rest of the $X$ axis is colored white.\nPlease note that colors at the endpoints of the intervals don't matter when computing the lengths, and we can ignore them. Open and closed intervals have been used in the explanation section only for clarity, and it doesn't matter whether they are open or closed.\nNote that 011 is also a valid output.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.\n\n    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.\n\n    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.\n\n    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Read number of boxes and capacity of each box\n            ducks = case[2]  # Read the list of duck counts\n            boxes = []  # This will hold the distribution of ducks in each box\n        \n            # Create a list of colors with their counts\n            color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]\n        \n            # Fill each box\n            for _ in range(N):\n                m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box\n                c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box\n            \n                # Try to fill the box with ducks\n                for i in range(len(color_counts)):\n                    if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full\n                        if color_counts[i][1] > 0:  # If there are ducks of this color\n                            if c1 == -1:  # First color\n                                c1 = color_counts[i][0]\n                                m1 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible\n                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m1)  # Update count\n                            elif c2 == -1:  # Second color\n                                c2 = color_counts[i][0]\n                                m2 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible\n                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m2)  # Update count\n            \n                # If we have only one color, ensure the other is set to 0\n                if c2 == -1:\n                    c2 = 0\n                    m2 = 0\n            \n                # Append the box configuration\n                boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))\n        \n            # Output the boxes\n            for box in boxes:\n                print(box[0], box[1], box[2], box[3])\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the challenges faced, and the final solution that met all requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.\n\n    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.\n\n    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            if K == N:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K = map(int, input().split())\n        test_cases.append((N, K))\n\n    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods.

The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.\n\n2. **Identifying the Mistake**: \n   - The current implementation checks for overlaps and colors the intervals based on that. However, it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. The logic only colors the last interval blue and the current one yellow, which may not maximize the green area.\n   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '001', which indicates that the last interval was incorrectly colored.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was too simplistic. It only considered the last colored interval and did not account for the possibility of multiple overlapping intervals needing to be colored differently to maximize the green area.\n   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.\n\n### Revised Approach:\nTo fix the code, we need to:\n- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.\n- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.\n- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.\n\n### Revised Pseudocode:\n```\nfunction maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read number of intervals n\n        read intervals L and R\n        sort intervals by L\n        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's\n        for i from 0 to n-1:\n            if current interval overlaps with any previous:\n                color current interval yellow\n                color overlapping intervals blue\n            else:\n                color current interval blue\n        print result as a string\n```\n\n### Final Python 3 Solution:\n```python\ndef maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals\n        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals\n        # Sort intervals based on their starting point\n        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))\n        \n        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue\n        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]\n            if L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap\n                result[index] = '1'  # Color current interval yellow\n                # Color the previous interval blue if it was not already colored\n                if result[index - 1] == '0':\n                    result[index - 1] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue\n            last_end = max(last_end, R)  # Update the last end\n        \n        print(''.join(result))  # Output the result for the test case\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    intervals = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n    test_cases.append((n, intervals))\n\nmaximize_green_intervals(test_cases)\n``` \n\nThis revised solution should correctly handle the coloring of intervals to maximize the green area."

        "content": "Let's analyze the code step-by-step to identify the issues that caused it to fail the tests:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the green area, which occurs when at least one interval is colored blue and at least one is colored yellow. The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.\n\n2. **Identifying the Mistake**:\n   - The current implementation attempts to color intervals based on overlaps, but it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. Specifically, it does not ensure that the intervals are colored in a way that maximizes the green area.\n   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '101', which indicates that both the first and second intervals were incorrectly colored.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was flawed. The code only checks if the current interval overlaps with the last colored interval, which is not sufficient. It should consider all previous intervals to determine the best coloring strategy.\n   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.\n\n### Revised Approach:\nTo fix the code, we need to:\n- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.\n- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.\n- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.\n\n### Revised Pseudocode:\n```\nfunction maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read number of intervals n\n        read intervals L and R\n        sort intervals by L\n        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's\n        for i from 0 to n-1:\n            if current interval overlaps with any previous:\n                color current interval yellow\n                color overlapping intervals blue\n            else:\n                color current interval blue\n        print result as a string\n```\n\n### Final Python 3 Solution:\n```python\ndef maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals\n        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals\n        # Sort intervals based on their starting point\n        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))\n        \n        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue\n        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval\n        colored_intervals = []  # To keep track of colored intervals\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]\n            if colored_intervals and L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap\n                # Color the current interval yellow\n                result[index] = '1'\n                # Color the last colored interval blue if it was not already colored\n                if result[colored_intervals[-1]] == '0':\n                    result[colored_intervals[-1]] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue\n            else:\n                # No overlap, color current interval blue\n                result[index] = '0'\n            \n            # Update the last end and add the current index to colored_intervals\n            last_end = max(last_end, R)\n            colored_intervals.append(index)\n        \n        print(''.join(result))  # Output the result for the test case\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    intervals = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n    test_cases.append((n, intervals))\n\nmaximize_green_intervals(test_cases)\n```\n\nThis revised solution should now correctly handle the coloring of intervals to maximize the green area."

The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box.

The expected output required alternating lines of numbers, where even-indexed lines counted up from `0` to the line index, and odd-indexed lines counted down from the line index to `0`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Pattern Recognition**: The output pattern alternates between counting up and counting down based on the line index. This was a crucial aspect that needed to be correctly implemented to match the expected output.\n    2. **Logic Implementation**: The initial attempts incorrectly generated lines by not adhering to the specified counting logic. The correct approach involved checking if the line index was even or odd and generating the line accordingly.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    The final corrected code that adheres to the requirements is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n        for K in test_cases:\n            for i in range(K):\n                line = \"\"\n                if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index: count up from 0 to i\n                    for j in range(i + 1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                else:  # Odd index: count down from i to 0\n                    for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                print(line)\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]\n    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    ### Lessons Learned:\n    - It is essential to carefully analyze the output requirements and ensure that the logic implemented matches those requirements.\n    - Alternating patterns can often lead to confusion; clear separation of logic for different cases (even vs. odd) is necessary to avoid errors.\n    - Testing with various inputs can help identify edge cases and ensure the robustness of the solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The intervals that overlap should be colored in such a way that they contribute to the green area.\n\n2. **Identifying the Mistake**:\n   - The current implementation attempts to color intervals based on overlaps, but it does not correctly handle the case where multiple intervals overlap. Specifically, it does not ensure that the intervals are colored in a way that maximizes the green area.\n   - The output for the test case provided indicates that the intervals were not colored optimally. The expected output was '100', meaning the first interval should be blue, the second yellow, and the third blue. However, the code produced '101', which indicates that both the first and second intervals were incorrectly colored.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   - The logic for determining overlaps and coloring was flawed. The code only checks if the current interval overlaps with the last colored interval, which is not sufficient. It should consider all previous intervals to determine the best coloring strategy.\n   - The approach should involve checking all intervals and determining the best coloring strategy based on overlaps, rather than just the last interval.\n\n### Revised Approach:\nTo fix the code, we need to:\n- Sort the intervals based on their starting points.\n- Use a more comprehensive strategy to color the intervals, ensuring that we maximize the green area by considering all overlaps.\n- Maintain a list of colored intervals and their colors, ensuring that we alternate colors when overlaps are detected.\n\n### Revised Pseudocode:\n```\nfunction maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read number of intervals n\n        read intervals L and R\n        sort intervals by L\n        initialize result as an empty list of size n with '0's\n        for i from 0 to n-1:\n            if current interval overlaps with any previous:\n                color current interval yellow\n                color overlapping intervals blue\n            else:\n                color current interval blue\n        print result as a string\n```\n\n### Final Python 3 Solution:\n```python\ndef maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals\n        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals\n        # Sort intervals based on their starting point\n        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))\n        \n        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue\n        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval\n        colored = []  # To keep track of colored intervals\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]\n            if colored and L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap\n                # Color the current interval yellow\n                result[index] = '1'\n                # Color the last colored interval blue if it was not already colored\n                if result[colored[-1]] == '0':\n                    result[colored[-1]] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue\n            else:\n                # No overlap, color current interval blue\n                result[index] = '0'\n            \n            # Update the last end and add the current index to colored\n            last_end = max(last_end, R)\n            colored.append(index)\n        \n        print(''.join(result))  # Output the result for the test case\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    intervals = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n    test_cases.append((n, intervals))\n\nmaximize_green_intervals(test_cases)\n```\n\nThis revised solution should now correctly handle the coloring of intervals to maximize the green area."

The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.\n\n    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.\n\n    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.\n\n    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges. \n\n    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Read number of boxes and capacity of each box\n            ducks = case[2]  # Read the list of duck counts\n            boxes = []  # This will hold the distribution of ducks in each box\n        \n            # Create a list of colors with their counts\n            color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]\n        \n            # Fill each box\n            for _ in range(N):\n                m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box\n                c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box\n            \n                # Try to fill the box with ducks\n                for i in range(len(color_counts)):\n                    if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full\n                        if color_counts[i][1] > 0:  # If there are ducks of this color\n                            if c1 == -1:  # First color\n                                c1 = color_counts[i][0]\n                                m1 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible\n                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m1)  # Update count\n                            elif c2 == -1:  # Second color\n                                c2 = color_counts[i][0]\n                                m2 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible\n                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m2)  # Update count\n            \n                # If we have only one color, ensure the other is set to 0\n                if c2 == -1:\n                    c2 = 0\n                    m2 = 0\n            \n                # Append the box configuration\n                boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))\n        \n            # Output the boxes\n            for box in boxes:\n                print(box[0], box[1], box[2], box[3])\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the challenges faced, and the final solution that met all requirements.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. The expected output required alternating lines of numbers, where even-indexed lines counted up from `0` to the line index, and odd-indexed lines counted down from the line index to `0`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Pattern Recognition**: The output pattern alternates between counting up and counting down based on the line index. This was a crucial aspect that needed to be correctly implemented to match the expected output.\n    2. **Logic Implementation**: The initial attempts incorrectly generated lines by not adhering to the specified counting logic. The correct approach involved checking if the line index was even or odd and generating the line accordingly.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    The final corrected code that adheres to the requirements is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n        for K in test_cases:\n            for i in range(K):\n                line = \"\"\n                if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index: count up from 0 to i\n                    for j in range(i + 1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                else:  # Odd index: count down from i to 0\n                    for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                print(line)\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]\n    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    ### Lessons Learned:\n    - It is essential to carefully analyze the output requirements and ensure that the logic implemented matches those requirements.\n    - Alternating patterns can often lead to confusion; clear separation of logic for different cases (even vs. odd) is necessary to avoid errors.\n    - Testing with various inputs can help identify edge cases and ensure the robustness of the solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of maximizing the green area by coloring intervals, I encountered several challenges that ultimately led to incorrect outputs. The primary issue was in the logic used to determine how to color overlapping intervals. My approach focused on checking overlaps with only the last colored interval, which was insufficient for correctly managing multiple overlapping intervals. This resulted in incorrect color assignments, as seen in the test case where the expected output was '100', but my solution produced '101'.\n\nThe official solution provided a more effective approach by maintaining separate lists for the left and right endpoints of the intervals, as well as a combined list of tuples that included the original indices. This allowed for a clear sorting of intervals based on their starting points. The key steps in the official solution include:\n\n1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted based on their starting points, which simplifies the overlap checking process.\n2. **Coloring Logic**: The solution uses a counter (`c`) to alternate colors based on the conditions of overlap. If the current interval starts after the maximum right endpoint seen so far, it is colored with the current color. If it overlaps with the maximum right endpoint, it is colored with the opposite color.\n3. **Efficient Updates**: The maximum right endpoint (`maxi`) is updated as needed, allowing for efficient management of overlapping intervals.\n\nThis structured approach not only simplifies the logic but also ensures that all intervals are considered correctly, leading to the desired output. The use of bitwise operations for toggling colors is also a clever optimization that reduces the need for additional condition checks.\n\nIn summary, the official solution's method of sorting and systematically managing overlaps through a clear set of rules proved to be more robust than my initial attempts. This experience highlights the importance of considering all relevant intervals when dealing with overlaps and the value of a well-structured approach to problem-solving."
