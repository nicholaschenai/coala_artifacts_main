    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights gained from previous attempts and the understanding of the problem, I will revise the solution to ensure that the intervals are colored optimally to maximize the green area. The key is to ensure that overlapping intervals are handled correctly and that we alternate colors appropriately.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. **Sort the intervals** based on their starting points.\n2. **Iterate through the sorted intervals** and check for overlaps.\n3. **Color the intervals** such that overlapping intervals contribute to the green area by ensuring at least one is blue and one is yellow.\n\n### Final Python 3 Solution:\n```python\ndef maximize_green_intervals(test_cases):\n    for intervals in test_cases:\n        n = intervals[0]  # number of intervals\n        intervals_list = intervals[1]  # list of intervals\n        # Sort intervals based on their starting point\n        indexed_intervals = sorted((L, R, i) for i, (L, R) in enumerate(intervals_list))\n        \n        result = ['0'] * n  # Initialize all intervals as blue\n        last_end = -1  # Track the end of the last colored interval\n        colored = []  # To keep track of colored intervals\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            L, R, index = indexed_intervals[i]\n            if colored and L <= last_end:  # There is an overlap\n                # Color the current interval yellow\n                result[index] = '1'\n                # Color the last colored interval blue if it was not already colored\n                if result[colored[-1]] == '0':\n                    result[colored[-1]] = '0'  # Ensure the previous is blue\n            else:\n                # No overlap, color current interval blue\n                result[index] = '0'\n            \n            # Update the last end and add the current index to colored\n            last_end = max(last_end, R)\n            colored.append(index)\n        \n        print(''.join(result))  # Output the result for the test case\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    n = int(input())\n    intervals = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n    test_cases.append((n, intervals))\n\nmaximize_green_intervals(test_cases)\n```\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n1. **Sorting**: The intervals are sorted based on their starting points to facilitate overlap checking.\n2. **Overlap Handling**: The logic now checks for overlaps correctly and colors the intervals accordingly.\n3. **Result Initialization**: The result list is initialized to all '0's (blue) and updated based on the overlap conditions.\n\nThis code should now correctly handle the coloring of intervals to maximize the green area.",
