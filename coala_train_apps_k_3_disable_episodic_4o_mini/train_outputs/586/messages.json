The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means $abc$, $acb$, $bac$, $bca$, $cab$, $cba$ refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.\n$N$.$B$. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team. \nThat means two teams named $xoxo$ and $oxox$ is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly $abb$ and $bab$ is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').\nIt is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.\n\n-----Input:-----Input:\n- \nFirst line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- \nThe first line of each test case contains two integers , $N$ and $R$ - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour. \n- \nThen $R$  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string $ti$, registered names of the teams and an integer $pi$, points they got on that submission.\n- \nThen $N-R$  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string $ti$- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and $pi$ -points they got on that submission.\n\n-----Output:-----Output:\nFor each testcase,print the scoreboard.\nThat means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order\n\n-----Constraints-----Constraints\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq R \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq ti \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq pi \\leq 10^6$\nSum of points ($pi$) of a team will not cross $10^9$.\n\n-----Sample Input:-----Sample Input:\n1\n10 5\namigoes  1\nbannermen 1\nmonarchy 4\noutliers 5\niniciador 10\naegimos 2\niiiacdnor 1\neilorstu 1\ngimosae 3\nmnachroy 7\n\n-----Sample Output:-----Sample Output:\niniciador 11\nmonarchy 11\namigoes 6\noutliers 6\nbannermen 1\n\n-----Explanation:-----Explanation:\n\n$It$ $is$ $assured$ $that$ $each$ $team$ $will$ $submit$ $once$ $within$ $first$ $half$ $an$ $hour$.That means -                                          \n\nthat kind of submissions isn't possible within first half an hour.\nDataset can be huge.

        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   Teacher Sungjae is organizing a programming competition and has a list of team submissions. Each team has a unique name, but the order of characters in the name does not matter (e.g., \"abc\" is the same as \"cba\"). After collecting scores from the teams, he wants to create a scoreboard that lists the teams and their total scores. The scoreboard should be sorted first by score in descending order, and if two teams have the same score, they should be sorted by their names in alphabetical order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - Read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions in the first half hour.\n   - Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters of the name) as the key.\n   - For the first half hour submissions, directly add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - Once all scores are collected, sort the teams first by score (in descending order) and then by name (in alphabetical order).\n   - Print the sorted results.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case from 1 to T:\n           read N, R\n           create an empty dictionary scores\n           for i from 1 to R:\n               read team_name, points\n               add points to scores[team_name]\n           for i from 1 to (N - R):\n               read scrambled_team_name, points\n               normalized_name = sort(scrambled_team_name)\n               add points to scores[normalized_name]\n           sorted_teams = sort(scores.items(), by score descending, then by name ascending)\n           for team, score in sorted_teams:\n               print team, score\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n        index += 1\n        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n        # Read the first R submissions\n        for _ in range(R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on the last space\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            scores[team_name] = scores.get(team_name, 0) + points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Read the remaining N-R submissions\n        for _ in range(N - R):\n            line = data[index].rsplit(' ', 1)  # Split on the last space\n            scrambled_team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(scrambled_team_name))  # Normalize the team name\n            scores[normalized_name] = scores.get(normalized_name, 0) + points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Sort teams by score (descending) and then by name (ascending)\n        sorted_teams = sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Prepare results for this test case\n        for team, score in sorted_teams:\n            results.append(f\"{team} {score}\")\n    \n    # Print all results\n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\n# Call the main function to execute the solution\nmain()\n```"

Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.\n\n    2. **Data Structure**: It uses a dictionary (`scores`) to map the difficulty score (n) to a list of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping of problems with the same difficulty.\n\n    3. **Pairing and Sorting**: For each problem, the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask are paired using a dictionary. The scores are then sorted, which simplifies the comparison of contestant numbers.\n\n    4. **Counting Decreases**: The solution counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases as it moves through the sorted scores. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent elements.\n\n    5. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores for all problems, the solution sorts the unique difficulty scores and then sorts the problem indices for each score before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the required order.\n\n    6. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.\n\n    In contrast to my initial approach, the official solution is more concise and leverages Python's built-in data structures effectively. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly mapping scores to problem indices, which simplifies the sorting and output process. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can simplify grouping and sorting tasks in programming challenges.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, I was required to determine the difficulty of contest problems based on their subtasks, which involved calculating how many times the number of contestants who solved a subtask decreased as we sorted the subtasks by score. The solution involved reading input data, processing it to count the decreases, and then sorting the problems based on their difficulty.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to manipulate and sort data structures effectively. I utilized tuples to store the difficulty of each problem and sorted them based on the defined criteria. The approach of pairing scores with the number of contestants and sorting them was straightforward and effective.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, and the code passed all tests without any errors. The key takeaway was the importance of careful data handling and sorting, especially when dealing with multiple criteria for comparison. The solution was efficient given the constraints, and I learned that maintaining clarity in the logic flow is crucial for solving such problems. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def main():\n        P, S = map(int, input().split())\n        difficulties = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, P + 1):\n            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))\n        \n            n = 0\n            for k in range(1, S):\n                if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:\n                    n += 1\n        \n            difficulties.append((n, i))\n    \n        difficulties.sort()\n    \n        for difficulty in difficulties:\n            print(difficulty[1])\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding sorting and counting mechanisms in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reference Code (Not callable)]:\n\n    [description for function: main]\n    This function reads the number of problems and subtasks, then processes each problem by reading scores and contestant counts. It pairs the scores with the corresponding contestants, sorts them, and counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases. The results are stored as tuples of difficulty and problem index. After processing all problems, it sorts the difficulties and outputs the indices of the problems in order of increasing difficulty. Finally, it prints the sorted indices.\n\n    [end of description]\n    This knowledge is useful in competitive programming and algorithm design, particularly in problems involving sorting and ranking based on multiple criteria. It can be applied in scenarios where tasks or problems need to be evaluated based on their difficulty, which is determined by the performance of contestants or users. This approach can also be beneficial in educational contexts, where assessments or quizzes are ranked based on the number of students who successfully completed each part, allowing educators to identify which topics may need more focus. Additionally, it can be relevant in game design, where levels or challenges are sorted by difficulty based on player performance metrics.\n\n\n    def main():\n        # Read number of problems and subtasks\n        P, S = map(int, input().split())\n        difficulties = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, P + 1):\n            # Read scores and number of contestants for each problem\n            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        \n            # Pair scores with contestants and sort by score\n            paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))\n        \n            # Count the number of valid indices where NS_k > NS_{k + 1}\n            n = 0\n            for k in range(1, S):\n                if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:\n                    n += 1\n        \n            # Store the difficulty as a tuple (n, i)\n            difficulties.append((n, i))\n    \n        # Sort difficulties by (n, i)\n        difficulties.sort()\n    \n        # Output the indices of the problems in increasing order of difficulty\n        for difficulty in difficulties:\n            print(difficulty[1])\n\n    # Call the main function to execute the code\n    main()\n\n[/Reference Code (Not callable)]\n\n"

When printing the results, I should have retained the original team names associated with their scores.\n   - The output format was not aligned with the expected output format, which requires a specific structure (list of dictionaries).\n\n4. **Steps to Fix the Code**:\n   - Instead of using the normalized name as the key, I should store both the original team name and the score in a way that allows me to retrieve the original name when sorting and printing.\n   - I will create a list of tuples that store both the normalized name and the original name, along with the score, and then sort based on the required criteria.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n        index += 1\n        \n        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n        # Process first half hour submissions\n        for _ in range(R):\n            line = data[index].split()\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n            if normalized_name not in scores:\n                scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n            scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Process remaining submissions\n        for _ in range(N - R):\n            line = data[index].split()\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n            if normalized_name not in scores:\n                scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n            scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Prepare result for sorting\n        result = [(name, score) for normalized_name, (name, score) in scores.items()]\n        # Sort by score (descending) and then by team name (lexicographical)\n        result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Print the results\n        for team_name, score in result:\n            print(team_name, score)\n\n# Call the main function to execute the code\nmain()\n``` \n\nIn this corrected version:\n- The `scores` dictionary now stores tuples of the original team name and the accumulated score.\n- The output is generated from the original team names, ensuring that the results are printed in the correct format."

The approach of pairing scores with the number of contestants and sorting them was straightforward and effective.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, and the code passed all tests without any errors. The key takeaway was the importance of careful data handling and sorting, especially when dealing with multiple criteria for comparison. The solution was efficient given the constraints, and I learned that maintaining clarity in the logic flow is crucial for solving such problems. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def main():\n        P, S = map(int, input().split())\n        difficulties = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, P + 1):\n            scores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            contestants = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            paired = sorted(zip(scores, contestants))\n        \n            n = 0\n            for k in range(1, S):\n                if paired[k - 1][1] > paired[k][1]:\n                    n += 1\n        \n            difficulties.append((n, i))\n    \n        difficulties.sort()\n    \n        for difficulty in difficulties:\n            print(difficulty[1])\n\n    main()\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding sorting and counting mechanisms in programming challenges.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The official solution effectively addresses the problem by utilizing a dictionary to group problems based on their calculated difficulty scores. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution that could be useful for future reference:\n\n    1. **Input Handling**: The solution begins by reading the number of problems (p) and subtasks (s) in a single line, which is efficient for handling input.\n\n    2. **Data Structure**: It uses a dictionary (`scores`) to map the difficulty score (n) to a list of problem indices. This allows for easy grouping of problems with the same difficulty.\n\n    3. **Pairing and Sorting**: For each problem, the scores and the number of contestants who solved each subtask are paired using a dictionary. The scores are then sorted, which simplifies the comparison of contestant numbers.\n\n    4. **Counting Decreases**: The solution counts the number of valid indices where the number of contestants decreases as it moves through the sorted scores. This is done using a simple loop that compares adjacent elements.\n\n    5. **Sorting and Output**: After calculating the scores for all problems, the solution sorts the unique difficulty scores and then sorts the problem indices for each score before printing them. This ensures that the output is in the required order.\n\n    6. **Efficiency**: The use of dictionaries and sorting operations is efficient given the constraints, and the overall complexity remains manageable even for the upper limits of the input sizes.\n\n    In contrast to my initial approach, the official solution is more concise and leverages Python's built-in data structures effectively. It avoids unnecessary complexity by directly mapping scores to problem indices, which simplifies the sorting and output process. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structures that can simplify grouping and sorting tasks in programming challenges.\n[/Reflection]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead achieved by either player at the end of any round, rather than simply summing their scores. The problem required careful tracking of cumulative scores and leads after each round.\n\n    The solution involved reading the number of rounds and the scores for each player, updating cumulative scores, and calculating the lead for each round. The maximum lead and the corresponding winner were tracked throughout the rounds. The implementation was straightforward, leveraging basic arithmetic and conditional statements to determine the leader and maximum lead.\n\n    The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and it passed the provided test case without any issues. Key concepts included cumulative score tracking, lead calculation, and conditional logic to determine the winner based on maximum lead. This experience reinforced the importance of maintaining state across iterations and the need for clear logic when comparing values. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_winner():\n        N = int(input())\n        cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n        cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n        max_lead = 0\n        winner = 0\n\n        for _ in range(N):\n            S1, S2 = map(int, input().split())\n            cumulative_score_player1 += S1\n            cumulative_score_player2 += S2\n        \n            if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n                lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2\n                if lead > max_lead:\n                    max_lead = lead\n                    winner = 1\n            else:\n                lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1\n                if lead > max_lead:\n                    max_lead = lead\n                    winner = 2\n\n        print(winner, max_lead)\n\n    find_winner()\n    ``` \n\n    This solution effectively meets the problem's requirements and demonstrates a clear understanding of the necessary logic and data handling.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The goal was to accumulate scores for each team based on their submissions while ensuring that teams with the same character composition were treated as identical.\n\nThe initial approach involved using a normalized version of the team names (sorted characters) as keys in a dictionary to accumulate scores. However, this led to the loss of the original team names, which was crucial for the final output. The output format required the original team names to be printed alongside their scores, sorted by score and then lexicographically by name.\n\nThe solution was refined by storing tuples in the dictionary that included both the original team name and the accumulated score.

While this method was fundamentally sound, it had a few shortcomings that I learned from.\n\nThe official solution effectively uses a similar normalization strategy but optimizes the process by maintaining a list of tuples that directly associates the original team names with their scores. This allows for efficient updates and retrievals without losing the original names. The key steps in the official solution include:\n\n1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and the number of submissions efficiently.\n2. **Score Accumulation**: It uses a list to store scores and normalized names, allowing for direct access and updates when processing submissions.\n3. **Sorting and Output**: After accumulating scores, it sorts the list based on scores and outputs the results in the required format.\n\nOne of the main insights from the official solution is the use of a list to store both the score and the original team name, which simplifies the process of updating scores and ensures that the original names are preserved for output. This contrasts with my initial implementation, where I lost track of the original names by using normalized names as dictionary keys.\n\nAdditionally, the official solution's approach to sorting and outputting results is straightforward and efficient, ensuring that the final output meets the problem's requirements without unnecessary complexity.\n\nOverall, this experience reinforced the importance of maintaining data integrity (in this case, preserving original names) while processing and accumulating results, as well as the value of efficient data structures for managing updates and retrievals."
