    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves a programming competition where teams submit their names and scores. Due to a mistake, the order of the team names has been scrambled, but the characters in the names can be rearranged. The goal is to tally the scores for each team based on their submissions, ensuring that teams with the same character composition are treated as the same team. Finally, the results should be displayed in order of total score, with ties broken by lexicographical order of the team names.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - Read the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, read the number of total submissions and the number of submissions made in the first half hour.\n   - Create a dictionary to store the scores for each team, using a normalized version of the team name (sorted characters) as the key.\n   - For the first half hour submissions, add the scores directly to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - For the remaining submissions, normalize the team names and add the scores to the corresponding team in the dictionary.\n   - Once all submissions are processed, sort the teams first by score in descending order and then by team name in lexicographical order.\n   - Print the sorted results.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function main():\n       read T  // number of test cases\n       for each test case:\n           read N, R  // total submissions, submissions in first half hour\n           create a dictionary scores\n           \n           for i from 1 to R:\n               read team_name, points\n               normalized_name = sort(team_name)\n               if normalized_name not in scores:\n                   scores[normalized_name] = 0\n               scores[normalized_name] += points\n           \n           for i from R+1 to N:\n               read team_name, points\n               normalized_name = sort(team_name)\n               if normalized_name not in scores:\n                   scores[normalized_name] = 0\n               scores[normalized_name] += points\n           \n           create a list result from scores\n           sort result by (-score, team_name)\n           \n           for each team in result:\n               print team_name, score\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n        index += 1\n        \n        scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n        # Process first half hour submissions\n        for _ in range(R):\n            line = data[index].split()\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n            if normalized_name not in scores:\n                scores[normalized_name] = 0\n            scores[normalized_name] += points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Process remaining submissions\n        for _ in range(N - R):\n            line = data[index].split()\n            team_name = line[0]\n            points = int(line[1])\n            normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n            if normalized_name not in scores:\n                scores[normalized_name] = 0\n            scores[normalized_name] += points\n            index += 1\n        \n        # Prepare result for sorting\n        result = [(name, score) for name, score in scores.items()]\n        # Sort by score (descending) and then by team name (lexicographical)\n        result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n        # Print the results\n        for team_name, score in result:\n            print(team_name, score)\n\n# Call the main function to execute the code\nmain()\n```",
