## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In a country popular for train travel, youÂ have planned some train travelling one year in advance.Â  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.Â  Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.
Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars;
a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars;
a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.Â  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.


Example 2:
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

Â 

Note:

1 <= days.length <= 365
1 <= days[i] <= 365
days is in strictly increasing order.
costs.length == 3
1 <= costs[i] <= 1000

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

The final python function should begin with: 
```python

class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

INFO - [Task id] 132 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine the minimum cost to travel on specific days of the year using train tickets that can be purchased in three different durations: a 1-day pass, a 7-day pass, and a 30-day pass. Each type of pass has a different cost, and we want to cover all the travel days with the least amount of money spent.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We'll create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel days up to the `i-th` day. For each travel day, we will consider the cost of buying each type of pass and update our `dp` array accordingly. The key is to check how far back each pass can cover and calculate the minimum cost at each step.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize a dp array of size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365) with all values set to infinity
   Set dp[0] = 0 (no cost for day 0)
   
   For each day in the days array:
       For each type of pass (1-day, 7-day, 30-day):
           Calculate the cost if we buy that pass on the current day
           Update the dp array with the minimum cost for that day
           
   Return the value in dp[365] which will be the minimum cost to cover all travel days
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: list[int], costs: list[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize a dp array of size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365)
        dp = [float('inf')] * 366
        dp[0] = 0  # No cost for day 0
        
        # Iterate through each travel day
        for day in days:
            # Calculate the minimum cost for each type of pass
            dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[day - 1] + costs[0])  # 1-day pass
            dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1])  # 7-day pass
            dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2])  # 30-day pass
        
        # The answer is the minimum cost to cover all travel days
        return dp[365]

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine the number of valid paths Ryan can take through a network of cities over a specified number of seconds while satisfying certain conditions. The approach involved using dynamic programming to track the number of ways to reach each city at each time step.

    ### Key Concepts:
    1. **Dynamic Programming Table:** A 2D table `dp[time][city]` was used to store the number of ways to be in a specific city at a specific time. The table was initialized with `dp[0][1] = 1`, indicating Ryan starts in city 1 at time 0.

    2. **State Transition:** For each time step, the algorithm updated the counts for adjacent cities and the same city, allowing Ryan to either move or stay.

    3. **Condition Checking:** After populating the DP table, the conditions were checked to ensure Ryan was in the required cities at the specified times. The product of valid paths was calculated based on the counts in the DP table.

    ### Issues Encountered:
    - The initial implementation failed to correctly account for the conditions, leading to incorrect outputs. Specifically, the multiplication of valid paths did not consider the simultaneous satisfaction of multiple conditions.
    - The output format was also incorrect, as it returned lists instead of integers.

    ### Lessons Learned:
    - It is crucial to ensure that the conditions are checked in a way that accounts for all possible paths leading to those conditions.
    - The importance of validating the bounds of time when checking conditions was highlighted, as conditions outside the range of K should be handled appropriately.
    - Future implementations should include thorough testing against edge cases to ensure robustness.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def count_trips(N, M, K, roads, Q, conditions):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        adjacency_list = [[] for _ in range(N + 1)]
        for u, v in roads:
            adjacency_list[u].append(v)
            adjacency_list[v].append(u)

        dp = [[0] * (N + 1) for _ in range(K + 1)]
        dp[0][1] = 1  # Starting at city 1 at time 0

        for time in range(K):
            for city in range(1, N + 1):
                if dp[time][city] > 0:
                    for neighbor in adjacency_list[city]:
                        dp[time + 1][neighbor] = (dp[time + 1][neighbor] + dp[time][city]) % MOD
                    dp[time + 1][city] = (dp[time + 1][city] + dp[time][city]) % MOD  # Stay in the same city

        valid_paths = 1
        for a_i, b_i in conditions:
            if b_i <= K:
                valid_paths = (valid_paths * dp[b_i][a_i]) % MOD

        return valid_paths
    ```

    This summary encapsulates the core concepts, strategies, and lessons learned from the problem-solving process, providing a reference for future similar challenges.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In solving the problem of determining the smallest possible weight of the last remaining rock after a series of smashes, I identified that the core concept revolves around partitioning the weights of the rocks. The goal is to minimize the difference between two groups of weights, which can be approached using dynamic programming.

    The strategy involved calculating the total weight of the rocks and then using a dynamic programming array to track achievable sums up to half of the total weight. By iterating through each rock and updating the DP array, I was able to determine the largest sum that could be formed without exceeding the target. The final result is derived from the total weight minus twice this sum.

    The implemented solution was efficient and passed all test cases, demonstrating that the approach of using dynamic programming to solve a subset sum-like problem was effective. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
            total_weight = sum(stones)
            target = total_weight // 2
            dp = [False] * (target + 1)
            dp[0] = True

            for stone in stones:
                for j in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - stone]

            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                if dp[j]:
                    return total_weight - 2 * j
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in problems and applying dynamic programming techniques to optimize solutions.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to determine the minimum weight capacity of a ship that can transport packages within a specified number of days. The approach I used was a binary search strategy, which is effective for problems involving finding a minimum or maximum value under certain constraints.

    The core concepts involved were:
    1. **Binary Search**: This was used to efficiently narrow down the possible ship capacities between the maximum weight of a single package and the total weight of all packages.
    2. **Greedy Approach**: The helper function `canShip` was implemented to check if a given capacity allows shipping all packages within the specified days by simulating the loading process.

    The final solution was structured with a main function `shipWithinDays` that performs the binary search and a helper function `canShip` that checks the feasibility of a given capacity. The code was straightforward and passed the provided test cases without issues.

    Key code snippets:
    ```python
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if self.canShip(weights, mid, D):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    return left
    ```

    Overall, the experience reinforced the effectiveness of combining binary search with a greedy checking mechanism for optimization problems involving constraints. No unexpected errors were encountered, and the solution was efficient enough to handle the problem's constraints.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
In a country popular for train travel, youÂ have planned some train travelling one year in advance.Â  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.Â  Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.
Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars;
a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars;
a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.Â  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.
Â 
Example 1:
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.


Example 2:
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

Â 

Note:

1 <= days.length <= 365
1 <= days[i] <= 365
days is in strictly increasing order.
costs.length == 3
1 <= costs[i] <= 1000

The output code needs to use the provided function signature

INFO - [Task id] 132 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to determine the minimum cost required to travel on specific days of the year using train tickets that can be purchased in three different durations: a 1-day pass, a 7-day pass, and a 30-day pass. Each type of pass has a different cost, and the goal is to cover all the specified travel days at the lowest possible expense.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel days up to day `i`. For each travel day, we will consider the cost of each type of pass and update the `dp` array accordingly. The idea is to check the cost of buying a pass for the current day and add it to the minimum cost of covering the previous days that the pass would cover.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Initialize a dp array of size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365) with infinity
   Set dp[0] = 0 (no cost for day 0)
   For each day in the travel days:
       For each type of pass (1-day, 7-day, 30-day):
           Calculate the cost if the pass is bought on the current day

INFO - [Task id] 132 [generation text] In this task, I implemented a solution to determine the minimum cost of train travel given specific travel days and ticket costs for different durations (1-day, 7-day, and 30-day passes). The problem required a dynamic programming approach to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each day of the year.

The core concept involved creating a `dp` array where each index represented the minimum cost to cover travel days up to that day. For each travel day, I considered the cost of each type of pass and updated the `dp` array accordingly. The solution effectively handled the constraints of the problem, ensuring that all specified travel days were covered at the lowest possible expense.

The final implementation was successful, passing the provided test cases. The key takeaway from this experience was the importance of dynamic programming in optimizing solutions for problems involving overlapping subproblems, such as calculating costs over a range of days. The approach of using a set for quick lookup of travel days also proved to be efficient. 

Here is the final code snippet for reference:

```python
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [float('inf')] * 366
        dp[0] = 0
        travel_days = set(days)

        for day in range(1, 366):

                dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1])  # 7-day pass
                dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2])  # 30-day pass
            else:
                dp[day] = dp[day - 1]

## Official solution
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] + [-1 for i in range(days[-1])]

                dp[i] = min(
                    dp[i-1] + costs[0],
                    dp[max(i-7, 0)] + costs[1],
                    dp[max(i-30, 0)] + costs[2],
                )
            
        return dp[-1]

INFO - [Task id] 132 [generation text] The official solution effectively utilizes dynamic programming to solve the problem of minimizing travel costs based on the given days and ticket prices. Here are the key insights and steps from the official solution:

1. **Initialization**: The solution initializes a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel up to day `i`. It starts with `0` for day `0` (no cost) and `-1` for all other days up to the last travel day, indicating that those days have not been covered yet.

2. **Marking Travel Days**: The solution iterates through the `days` array and sets `dp[day]` to `0` for each travel day. This indicates that these days are significant for cost calculations.

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The solution then iterates through each day from `1` to the last day in the `dp` array. If a day is not a travel day (indicated by `dp[i] == -1`), it carries forward the cost from the previous day. If it is a travel day, it calculates the minimum cost by considering the three types of passes:
   - Adding the cost of a 1-day pass to the cost of the previous day.
   - Adding the cost of a 7-day pass to the cost from 7 days prior.
   - Adding the cost of a 30-day pass to the cost from 30 days prior.

4. **Final Result**: The final result is found in `dp[-1]`, which gives the minimum cost to cover all travel days.

The official solution is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that all possible ticket combinations are considered while maintaining clarity in the logic. My initial approach was similar but could have been optimized in terms of initialization and handling of non-travel days. The official solution's use of `-1` to mark unvisited days is a clean way to manage the state of the `dp` array. Overall, the official solution is a solid reference for implementing dynamic programming in similar problems.

For each day of the year, it checks if it is a travel day and updates the cost based on the cheapest ticket option available (1-day, 7-day, or 30-day pass). If the day is not a travel day, it simply carries forward the cost from the previous day. Finally, it returns the minimum cost required to cover all travel days by the end of the year. The approach efficiently computes the solution using dynamic programming principles.

[Problem]
    In a country popular for train travel, youÂ have planned some train travelling one year in advance.Â  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.Â  Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.
    Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

    a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars;
    a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars;
    a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.

    The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.Â  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
    Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.
Â 
    Example 1:
    Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
    Output: 11
    Explanation: 
    For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
    On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
    On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
    On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
    In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.


    Example 2:
    Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
    Output: 17
    Explanation: 
    For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
    On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
    On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
    In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

Â 

    Note:

    1 <= days.length <= 365
    1 <= days[i] <= 365
    days is in strictly increasing order.
    costs.length == 3
    1 <= costs[i] <= 1000

    class Solution:
        def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:
            # Initialize a dp array with size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365)
            dp = [float('inf')] * 366
            dp[0] = 0  # No cost for day 0

            # Set of travel days for quick lookup
            travel_days = set(days)

            # Iterate through each day of the year
            for day in range(1, 366):
                if day in travel_days:
                    # Calculate the minimum cost for the current day
                    dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[day - 1] + costs[0])  # 1-day pass
                    dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1])  # 7-day pass
                    dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2])  # 30-day pass
                else:
                    # If not a travel day, carry forward the previous cost
                    dp[day] = dp[day - 1]

            # The answer is the minimum cost to cover all travel days
            return dp[365]
