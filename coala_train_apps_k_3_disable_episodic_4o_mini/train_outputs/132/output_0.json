    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to determine the minimum cost required to travel on specific days of the year using train tickets that can be purchased in three different durations: a 1-day pass, a 7-day pass, and a 30-day pass. Each type of pass has a different cost, and the goal is to cover all the specified travel days at the lowest possible expense.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel days up to day `i`. For each travel day, we will consider the cost of each type of pass and update the `dp` array accordingly. The idea is to check the cost of buying a pass for the current day and add it to the minimum cost of covering the previous days that the pass would cover.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize a dp array of size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365) with infinity\n   Set dp[0] = 0 (no cost for day 0)\n   For each day in the travel days:\n       For each type of pass (1-day, 7-day, 30-day):\n           Calculate the cost if the pass is bought on the current day\n           Update the dp array for the days covered by the pass\n   Return the minimum cost from the dp array for the last travel day\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def mincostTickets(self, days: List[int], costs: List[int]) -> int:\n        # Initialize a dp array with size 366 (to cover days 1 to 365)\n        dp = [float('inf')] * 366\n        dp[0] = 0  # No cost for day 0\n\n        # Set of travel days for quick lookup\n        travel_days = set(days)\n\n        # Iterate through each day of the year\n        for day in range(1, 366):\n            if day in travel_days:\n                # Calculate the minimum cost for the current day\n                dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[day - 1] + costs[0])  # 1-day pass\n                dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1])  # 7-day pass\n                dp[day] = min(dp[day], dp[max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2])  # 30-day pass\n            else:\n                # If not a travel day, carry forward the previous cost\n                dp[day] = dp[day - 1]\n\n        # The answer is the minimum cost to cover all travel days\n        return dp[365]\n```",
