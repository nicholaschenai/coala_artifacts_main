## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
You have a string S consisting of N uppercase English letters. You are allowed to perform at most one operation of following kind: Choose any position in the string, remove the character at that position and insert it back to any other place in the string.

Find the  lexicographically smallest  string you can achieve.

-----Input-----
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the single integer N denoting length of string S.
The second line contains the string S.

-----Output-----
For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 50
- 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 50
- S will consist of uppercase English letters.

-----Example-----
Input:
2
4
DCBA
7
XYZZYZZ

Output:
ADCB
XYYZZZZ

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1. The optimal solution here is to choose the last character and put it in the beginning of the string. So the answer will be ADCB
Example case 2. The optimal solution here is to choose the 5-th character (1-based index) and put it between the 2-nd and the 3-rd characters. So the answer will be XYYZZZZ

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by moving one character from any position in a given string to any other position. We will do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and consider it as the character to be moved. For each character, we will remove it from its original position and try inserting it at every possible position in the string. After each insertion, we will check if the new string is smaller than the previously found smallest string. We will keep track of the smallest string found during this process.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_smallest_string(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           N = length of test_case
           S = test_case
           smallest_string = S
           
           for i from 0 to N-1:  // for each character in S
               char_to_move = S[i]
               remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  // string without the character
               
               for j from 0 to N:  // try inserting char_to_move at every position
                   new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]
                   if new_string < smallest_string:
                       smallest_string = new_string

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The approach involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the current arrangement, as the books not in this subsequence would need to be moved.

    The solution utilized a dynamic programming technique to compute the LIS. The key steps included initializing an array to track the lengths of increasing subsequences and iterating through the books to update these lengths based on comparisons. The final result was derived by subtracting the length of the LIS from the total number of books.

    The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test case. The main takeaway is the effectiveness of the LIS approach in minimizing moves for sorting problems, which can be applied to similar scenarios involving permutations and orderings. 

    Hereâ€™s the core code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):
        lis = [1] * N
        for i in range(1, N):
            for j in range(i):
                if books[i] > books[j]:
                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)
        longest_increasing_length = max(lis)
        return N - longest_increasing_length

    N = int(input())
    books = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))
    ``` 

    This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.
[/Summary]


[Reflection]:
    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience

    In my attempts to solve the problem of finding the shortest superstring, I learned several key insights that highlight the differences between my approach and the official solution.

    1. **Handling Overlaps**: My initial implementation focused on merging strings based on maximum overlaps but did not effectively explore all possible combinations of string arrangements. The official solution uses a more systematic approach by defining a `merge` function that checks for overlaps in a more comprehensive manner, ensuring that the best possible merge is achieved.

    2. **Memoization**: The official solution employs memoization to optimize the recursive function that finds the shortest superstring. This technique significantly reduces redundant calculations by storing previously computed results, which I did not implement in my solution. This is crucial for improving performance, especially given the potential exponential number of combinations.

    3. **Tuple Representation**: The official solution uses tuples to represent the indices of the strings being processed, which simplifies the management of remaining strings during recursion. This contrasts with my approach, which directly manipulated lists, leading to more complex logic and potential inefficiencies.

    4. **Final Selection**: The official solution efficiently finds the minimum length superstring by evaluating all possible starting points and using the `min` function to select the shortest result. My approach did not adequately ensure that all permutations were considered in a way that guaranteed the shortest output.

    ### Key Code Snippets from the Official Solution
    - **Merge Function**:
        ```python
        def merge(w1, w2):
            for k in range(len(w2), -1, -1):
                if w1.endswith(w2[:k]):
                    return w1 + w2[k:]
        ```

    - **Memoization Decorator**:
        ```python
        def memo(f):
            dic = {}
            def f_alt(*args):
                if args not in dic:
                    dic[args] = f(*args)
                return dic[args]
            return f_alt
        ```

    - **Recursive Function**:
        ```python
        @memo
        def find_short(tup, last):
            if len(tup) == 1:
                return A[tup[0]]
            mtup = tuple(t for t in tup if t != last)
            return min((merge(find_short(mtup, t), A[last]) for t in mtup), key=len)
        ```

    Overall, the official solution's use of memoization, efficient merging, and tuple management provides a more effective and optimized approach to solving the problem, highlighting areas for improvement in my own coding strategies.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. We need to do this for multiple test cases.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string. For each character, we will remove it and then try to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string.

Now, summarize your attempts as a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

- Only include the most relevant information and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - Identifying the core concepts and patterns that problem appears to test for
    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. 

The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach of generating all possible strings by removing and reinserting characters was effective, and the use of comparisons to track the smallest string worked as intended.

The final implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each string, and outputting the results. The code was structured to first define the main function and then handle input/output, ensuring clarity and separation of logic. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. 

Key code snippet:
```python
for i in range(N):  # Iterate through each character
    char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to move
    remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remove the character
    for j in range(N):  # Try to insert the character at every position
        new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]
        if new_string < smallest_string:  # Check if the new string is smaller
            smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string
``` 

This experience reinforced the importance of string manipulation techniques and careful iteration when solving combinatorial problems.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

## Official solution
for _1 in range(int(input())):
 n=int(input())
 s=input().strip()
 answer=s
 for i in range(len(s)):
  c=s[i]
  string=s[:i]+s[i+1:]
  for j in range(len(string)+1):
   answer=min(answer, string[:j]+c+string[j:])
 print(answer)

INFO - [Task id] 1477 [generation text] The official solution effectively addresses the problem by iterating through each character in the string and considering all possible positions for reinserting that character. The key insight is the use of the `min` function to keep track of the lexicographically smallest string encountered during the iterations. This approach is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in string comparison capabilities.

One notable aspect of the official solution is its simplicity and clarity. It maintains a single variable `answer` initialized to the original string, which is updated whenever a smaller string is found. This avoids the need for an additional list to store results, making the code more concise.

In terms of performance, both the official solution and my approach have similar time complexity, as they both involve nested loops iterating through the string. However, the official solution is slightly more efficient in terms of space since it does not require an extra list to store intermediate results.

Overall, the official solution reinforces the importance of leveraging built-in functions for comparisons and maintaining clarity in variable usage. It serves as a reminder to focus on simplicity and efficiency in problem-solving.
