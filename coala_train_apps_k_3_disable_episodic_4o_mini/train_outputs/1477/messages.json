The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of \"abc\" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.\n\n    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of \"abc\" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.\n\n    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of \"abc\". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this task, the goal was to determine the minimum number of moves required to sort a permutation of books numbered from 1 to N. The approach involved finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of the current arrangement, as the books not in this subsequence would need to be moved.\n\n    The solution utilized a dynamic programming technique to compute the LIS. The key steps included initializing an array to track the lengths of increasing subsequences and iterating through the books to update these lengths based on comparisons. The final result was derived by subtracting the length of the LIS from the total number of books.\n\n    The implemented code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was sound, as evidenced by passing the provided test case. The main takeaway is the effectiveness of the LIS approach in minimizing moves for sorting problems, which can be applied to similar scenarios involving permutations and orderings. \n\n    Here\u2019s the core code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def min_moves_to_sort(N, books):\n        lis = [1] * N\n        for i in range(1, N):\n            for j in range(i):\n                if books[i] > books[j]:\n                    lis[i] = max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1)\n        longest_increasing_length = max(lis)\n        return N - longest_increasing_length\n\n    N = int(input())\n    books = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    print(min_moves_to_sort(N, books))\n    ``` \n\n    This solution is efficient and works well within the problem's constraints.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Reflection]:\n    ### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\n    In my attempts to solve the problem of finding the shortest superstring, I learned several key insights that highlight the differences between my approach and the official solution.\n\n    1. **Handling Overlaps**: My initial implementation focused on merging strings based on maximum overlaps but did not effectively explore all possible combinations of string arrangements. The official solution uses a more systematic approach by defining a `merge` function that checks for overlaps in a more comprehensive manner, ensuring that the best possible merge is achieved.\n\n    2. **Memoization**: The official solution employs memoization to optimize the recursive function that finds the shortest superstring. This technique significantly reduces redundant calculations by storing previously computed results, which I did not implement in my solution. This is crucial for improving performance, especially given the potential exponential number of combinations.\n\n    3. **Tuple Representation**: The official solution uses tuples to represent the indices of the strings being processed, which simplifies the management of remaining strings during recursion. This contrasts with my approach, which directly manipulated lists, leading to more complex logic and potential inefficiencies.\n\n    4. **Final Selection**: The official solution efficiently finds the minimum length superstring by evaluating all possible starting points and using the `min` function to select the shortest result. My approach did not adequately ensure that all permutations were considered in a way that guaranteed the shortest output.\n\n    ### Key Code Snippets from the Official Solution\n    - **Merge Function**:\n        ```python\n        def merge(w1, w2):\n            for k in range(len(w2), -1, -1):\n                if w1.endswith(w2[:k]):\n                    return w1 + w2[k:]\n        ```\n\n    - **Memoization Decorator**:\n        ```python\n        def memo(f):\n            dic = {}\n            def f_alt(*args):\n                if args not in dic:\n                    dic[args] = f(*args)\n                return dic[args]\n            return f_alt\n        ```\n\n    - **Recursive Function**:\n        ```python\n        @memo\n        def find_short(tup, last):\n            if len(tup) == 1:\n                return A[tup[0]]\n            mtup = tuple(t for t in tup if t != last)\n            return min((merge(find_short(mtup, t), A[last]) for t in mtup), key=len)\n        ```\n\n    Overall, the official solution's use of memoization, efficient merging, and tuple management provides a more effective and optimized approach to solving the problem, highlighting areas for improvement in my own coding strategies.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
