    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   We have a number of students represented as a string of characters, where 'b' stands for boys and 'g' stands for girls. The goal is to rearrange these students in such a way that the \"awkwardness\" of their arrangement is minimized. Awkwardness is defined as the sum of distances between every boy and girl in the line. We need to find the minimum possible awkwardness after rearranging the students.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To minimize awkwardness, we should group all boys together and all girls together. This way, the distance between boys and girls is minimized. The optimal arrangement would be either all boys followed by all girls or all girls followed by all boys. The awkwardness can be calculated based on the number of boys and girls and their respective positions in the line.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n       count_b = count of 'b' in s\n       count_g = count of 'g' in s\n       \n       # Calculate awkwardness for arrangement \"bb...bgg...g\"\n       awkwardness_b_first = count_b * count_g * (count_b + count_g - 1) / 2\n       \n       # Calculate awkwardness for arrangement \"gg...gbb...b\"\n       awkwardness_g_first = count_g * count_b * (count_b + count_g - 1) / 2\n       \n       # The minimum awkwardness is the minimum of the two arrangements\n       return min(awkwardness_b_first, awkwardness_g_first)\n\n   function main():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read s\n           result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s):\n    # Count the number of boys and girls\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_g = s.count('g')\n    \n    # Calculate awkwardness for arrangement \"bb...bgg...g\"\n    awkwardness_b_first = count_b * count_g * (count_b + count_g - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Calculate awkwardness for arrangement \"gg...gbb...b\"\n    awkwardness_g_first = count_g * count_b * (count_b + count_g - 1) // 2\n    \n    # The minimum awkwardness is the minimum of the two arrangements\n    return min(awkwardness_b_first, awkwardness_g_first)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n    results = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, T + 1):\n        s = data[i]  # Read each string of students\n        result = calculate_minimum_awkwardness(s)  # Calculate minimum awkwardness\n        results.append(result)  # Store the result\n    \n    # Print all results for each test case\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Call the main function to execute the code\nmain()\n```",
