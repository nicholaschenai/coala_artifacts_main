The function \\( f(P) \\) is defined as the sum of the maximum of adjacent pairs in the permutation. The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\).\n\n    #### Key Insights:\n    1. **Maximum Calculation**: The maximum value of \\( f(P) \\) is crucial for determining if a valid permutation exists. If \\( K \\) exceeds this maximum, the output should be -1.\n    2. **Permutation Construction**: Starting with a descending order permutation (which maximizes \\( f(P) \\)) is a logical approach. Adjustments need to be made to reach the desired \\( K \\) by reducing the contributions of certain pairs.\n\n    #### Issues Encountered:\n    - The initial implementations failed to correctly adjust the permutation to achieve \\( K \\). The logic for reducing the sum was not effectively implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.\n    - The approach to swap elements to reduce the sum was not properly handled, resulting in consistently returning -1 for valid cases.\n\n    #### Strategies That Did Not Work:\n    - The attempts to reduce the current element without ensuring the validity of the permutation led to incorrect results.\n    - The logic for adjusting the permutation was overly complicated and did not account for the necessary conditions to maintain a valid permutation.\n\n    #### Final Code Snippet:\n    The final approach should focus on starting with a descending permutation and adjusting it correctly to reach \\( K \\). However, the last provided code still failed to pass the tests, indicating that further refinement is needed in the logic for adjusting the permutation.\n\n    ```python\n    def find_permutation(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case\n            max_value = (N * (N - 1)) // 2  # Maximum f(P) for descending order\n        \n            if K > max_value:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                # Start with descending order\n                permutation = list(range(N, 0, -1))\n                current_sum = max_value\n            \n                # Adjust the permutation to reach K\n                for i in range(N - 1):\n                    if current_sum == K:\n                        break\n                    needed_reduce = current_sum - K\n                    max_reduce = min(needed_reduce, permutation[i] - 1)\n                    if max_reduce > 0:\n                        permutation[i] -= max_reduce\n                        current_sum -= max_reduce\n            \n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, permutation)))\n    \n        print(\"\\n\".join(map(str, results)))\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing the conditions for valid permutations while adjusting sums. Future attempts should focus on simplifying the adjustment logic and ensuring that the permutation remains valid throughout the process.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. The expected output required alternating lines of numbers, where even-indexed lines counted up from `0` to the line index, and odd-indexed lines counted down from the line index to `0`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Pattern Recognition**: The output pattern alternates between counting up and counting down based on the line index. This was a crucial aspect that needed to be correctly implemented to match the expected output.\n    2. **Logic Implementation**: The initial attempts incorrectly generated lines by not adhering to the specified counting logic. The correct approach involved checking if the line index was even or odd and generating the line accordingly.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    The final corrected code that adheres to the requirements is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n        for K in test_cases:\n            for i in range(K):\n                line = \"\"\n                if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index: count up from 0 to i\n                    for j in range(i + 1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                else:  # Odd index: count down from i to 0\n                    for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                print(line)\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]\n    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    ### Lessons Learned:\n    - It is essential to carefully analyze the output requirements and ensure that the logic implemented matches those requirements.\n    - Alternating patterns can often lead to confusion; clear separation of logic for different cases (even vs. odd) is necessary to avoid errors.\n    - Testing with various inputs can help identify edge cases and ensure the robustness of the solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The initial approach was to derive a formula based on the pattern observed, but it seems that the formula used was incorrect.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**:\n   To find the correct formula, we can look at the differences between the terms:\n   - 1 - 0 = 1\n   - 5 - 1 = 4\n   - 14 - 5 = 9\n   - 30 - 14 = 16\n   - 55 - 30 = 25\n\n   The differences are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, which are perfect squares (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2). This suggests that the N'th term can be calculated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n3. **Correct Formula**:\n   The correct formula for the N'th term in the series can be derived as:\n   - T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2\n   - Starting with T(1) = 0, we can compute subsequent terms.\n\n4. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:\n   The previous implementation incorrectly used a formula that did not match the series.

The solution required computing `N! * X` modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\). \n\n    Key insights included recognizing that for large values of `N` (up to \\(10^{18}\\)), directly calculating `N!` is impractical. Instead, I implemented a function to compute the factorial modulo \\(10^6 + 3\\), leveraging the fact that if `N` is greater than or equal to the modulus, the result would be zero due to the factorial containing the modulus as a factor.\n\n    The final implementation efficiently handled multiple test cases by reading input in bulk and processing each case in a loop.

The maximum possible value of \\( f(P) \\) for a permutation of size \\( N \\) is \\( N(N-1)/2 \\). This understanding is crucial for determining the feasibility of achieving a specific \\( K \\).\n\n    2. **Feasibility Conditions**: The official solution checks specific conditions to determine if \\( K \\) is achievable:\n       - For even \\( N \\), \\( K \\) must be within the bounds of \\( (N(N+1)/2 - 1) \\) and \\( 3((N/2)^2) - 1 \\).\n       - For odd \\( N \\), similar bounds apply, but with adjustments for the odd case.\n\n    3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution constructs the permutation by:\n       - Starting with a descending order.\n       - Adjusting elements based on the difference between the desired \\( K \\) and the maximum possible sum.\n       - Using a systematic approach to fill in the permutation while ensuring that the conditions for \\( K \\) are met.\n\n    4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution employs an iterative method to adjust the permutation based on the remaining value of \\( K \\) after accounting for the maximum possible sum. This involves incrementally modifying the permutation to reach the desired sum.\n\n    ### Code Snippet from Official Solution:\n    The official solution uses a structured approach to handle both even and odd cases, ensuring that the permutation is constructed correctly based on the conditions derived from \\( K \\).\n\n    ```python\n    if(n%2==0):\n        if(k<(n*(n+1))//2 - 1  or  k>3*((n//2)**2) - 1): print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    else:\n        if(n==1): print(1) if(k==0) else print(-1)\n        # Additional logic for constructing the permutation\n    ```\n\n    ### Conclusion:\n    The official solution effectively breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that all edge cases are handled. My previous attempts failed primarily due to not fully accounting for the bounds of \\( K \\) and the systematic construction of the permutation. This experience highlights the importance of understanding the problem constraints and the need for a structured approach to constructing solutions in combinatorial problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
