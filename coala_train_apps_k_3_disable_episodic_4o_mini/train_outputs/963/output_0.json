    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves a series of hills with varying heights, and we need to determine the minimum number of water reservoirs required to supply water to all hills. Each reservoir can supply water in one direction (either left or right) until it reaches a taller hill. The goal is to find the optimal placement and direction of these reservoirs to minimize their number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. We will iterate through the list of hills and determine the optimal placement of reservoirs. For each hill, we will check if it can supply water to the left or right without needing additional reservoirs. If a hill cannot supply water to all previous or subsequent hills, we will place a reservoir there. We will keep track of the highest hill encountered so far from both directions to decide when to place a reservoir.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_reservoirs(hills):\n       left_max = -1\n       right_max = -1\n       reservoirs = 0\n       \n       for i from 0 to N-1:\n           if hills[i] > left_max:\n               reservoirs += 1\n               left_max = hills[i]\n       \n       for i from N-1 to 0:\n           if hills[i] > right_max:\n               reservoirs += 1\n               right_max = hills[i]\n       \n       return reservoirs\n       \n   function solve():\n       read T\n       for each test case:\n           read N\n           read hills\n           result = min_reservoirs(hills)\n           print result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_reservoirs(hills):\n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum heights from both directions\n    left_max = -1\n    right_max = -1\n    reservoirs = 0\n    \n    # First pass: count reservoirs needed for left direction\n    for i in range(len(hills)):\n        if hills[i] > left_max:\n            reservoirs += 1  # Place a reservoir here\n            left_max = hills[i]  # Update the left max height\n    \n    # Second pass: count reservoirs needed for right direction\n    for i in range(len(hills) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if hills[i] > right_max:\n            reservoirs += 1  # Place a reservoir here\n            right_max = hills[i]  # Update the right max height\n    \n    return reservoirs\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    index = 0\n    T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n    index += 1\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])  # Read number of hills\n        index += 1\n        \n        hills = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read the heights of the hills\n        index += 1\n        \n        result = min_reservoirs(hills)  # Calculate the minimum reservoirs needed\n        results.append(result)  # Store the result\n    \n    # Print all results for all test cases\n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\n# Call the solve function to execute the code\nsolve()\n```",
