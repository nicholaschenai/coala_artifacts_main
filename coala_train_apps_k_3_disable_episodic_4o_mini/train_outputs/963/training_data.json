    "summary": "In attempting to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of reservoirs needed to supply water to a series of hills, I initially misunderstood the requirements for counting reservoirs. The key concept is that each reservoir can supply water in one direction until it reaches a taller hill, and the goal is to minimize the number of reservoirs while ensuring all hills receive water.\n\nMy first approach involved iterating through the hills and counting reservoirs based on the maximum height encountered from both the left and right. However, this led to double counting reservoirs for hills that could be covered by a single reservoir. The logic for marking hills as covered was flawed, resulting in incorrect outputs.\n\nAfter several iterations, I attempted a stack-based approach, which is a common strategy for problems involving sequences and conditions based on relative heights. The idea was to maintain a stack of indices representing hills that could potentially supply water. However, this approach also failed to yield the correct results due to incorrect handling of the coverage logic.\n\nUltimately, the correct solution requires a more nuanced understanding of how to track coverage and when to place reservoirs. The solution should involve a single pass from left to right and another from right to left, ensuring that reservoirs are only counted when necessary and that hills are marked as covered appropriately.\n\nThe final code structure should focus on maintaining a clear distinction between the left and right coverage while ensuring that reservoirs are only counted when they are truly needed. This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing state and coverage in problems involving sequences and conditions.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of reservoirs needed for the hills, I initially approached it using a stack-based method to track the heights and coverage of the hills. However, my solution failed to account for the optimal placement of reservoirs effectively, leading to incorrect results in test cases. Specifically, I did not properly manage the coverage of hills when placing reservoirs, which resulted in over-counting.\n\nThe official solution provided a recursive approach that leverages the position of the highest hill (the peak) to determine the number of reservoirs needed. The key insight is that the problem can be broken down into subproblems based on the peak's position. If the peak is at either end of the list, only one reservoir is needed. Otherwise, the solution recursively calculates the reservoirs needed for the left and right segments of the list, adding one for the peak itself. This approach is efficient because it reduces the problem size significantly with each recursive call, focusing on the segments of the list rather than iterating through all hills multiple times.\n\nThe official solution's effectiveness lies in its simplicity and the clear breakdown of the problem into manageable parts. It avoids the complexity of tracking covered hills and instead uses the peak's position as a natural divider, which is a more elegant solution than my initial stack-based approach. This experience highlights the importance of considering problem decomposition and leveraging recursive strategies for optimization in similar scenarios.",
