3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The problem requires us to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". If a quote contains the word "not", it is classified as "Real Fancy". If it does not contain the word "not", it is classified as "regularly fancy". We need to process multiple quotes as input and provide the classification for each.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We will read the number of quotes (test cases) and then for each quote, we will check if the word "not" is present. To do this, we can split the quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words. Based on this check, we will print "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy".

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Read the integer T (number of test cases)
   For each test case from 1 to T:
       Read the quote S
       Split S into words
       If "not" is in the list of words:
           Print "Real Fancy"
       Else:
           Print "regularly fancy"
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
# Function to classify quotes as Real Fancy or regularly fancy
def classify_quotes():
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    
    # Iterate over each test case
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the quote
        S = input()
        
        # Split the quote into words
        words = S.split()
        
        # Check if "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            # If "not" is found, print "Real Fancy"
            print("Real Fancy")
        else:
            # If "not" is not found, print "regularly fancy"
            print("regularly fancy")

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the N'th number in a specific series: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.

    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def calculate_nth_number(n):
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        else:
            total = 0
            for i in range(1, n):
                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers
            return total

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case
            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number
            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result
    
        for res in results:
            print(res)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values. The final solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness.

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the most frequently occurring largest prime factor from a list of integers across multiple test cases. The solution involved two main components: determining the largest prime factor for each number and counting the occurrences of these prime factors.

    The approach I took was to implement a function `largest_prime_factor` that efficiently calculates the largest prime factor of a given number using trial division. This function checks for divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) and continues with odd numbers up to the square root of the number. The main function `solve` reads input, processes each test case, and maintains a count of the largest prime factors using a dictionary.

    The solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing the provided test cases. Key concepts included prime factorization and frequency counting, which are common in problems involving number theory. The implementation was efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the constraints without performance issues.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding prime factorization and efficient counting techniques in algorithm design. The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def largest_prime_factor(n):
        largest_prime = 1
        while n % 2 == 0:
            largest_prime = 2
            n //= 2
        for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
            while n % i == 0:
                largest_prime = i
                n //= i
        if n > 2:
            largest_prime = n
        return largest_prime

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        index = 1
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            elements = list(map(int, data[index].split()))
            index += 1
        
            prime_count = {}
        
            for number in elements:
                largest_prime = largest_prime_factor(number)
                if largest_prime in prime_count:
                    prime_count[largest_prime] += 1
                else:
                    prime_count[largest_prime] = 1
        
            max_count = -1
            result_prime = -1
        
            for prime, count in prime_count.items():

            results.append(result_prime)
    
        for res in results:

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.

    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.

    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.

    Here’s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
        if k > n or k < 0:
            return 0
        if k == 0 or k == n:
            return 1
        res = 1
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i
        return res

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())
            index += 1
        
            for __ in range(Q):
                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())
                index += 1
            
                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:
                    results.append(0)
                    continue
            
                left_count = I - 1
                right_count = N - I
            
                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD
                results.append(total_subsets)
    
        sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.

[BEGIN PROBLEM]
"I don't have any fancy quotes." - vijju123
Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
You are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 50$
- $1 \le |S| \le 100$
- each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space

-----Subtasks-----
Subtask #1 (100 points): original constraints

-----Example Input-----

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to classify quotes based on whether they contain the word "not". If a quote contains "not", it is classified as "Real Fancy"; otherwise, it is classified as "regularly fancy". We need to process multiple quotes and provide the classification for each.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of quotes (test cases).
   - For each quote, check if the word "not" is present.
   - If "not" is found, classify the quote as "Real Fancy"; if not, classify it as "regularly fancy".
   - Print the classification for each quote.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function classify_quotes():
       read integer T  // number of test cases
       for i from 1 to T:
           read string S  // the quote
           if "not" in S:
               print "Real Fancy"
           else:
               print "regularly fancy"

   classify_quotes()
   ```

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   The goal is to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". If "not" appears as a standalone word in the quote, it should be classified as "Real Fancy". If it does not appear, it should be classified as "regularly fancy".

2. **Identifying the Issue:**
   The current implementation checks for the substring "not" in the quote. This means that it would incorrectly classify quotes that contain "not" as part of another word (e.g., "nothing") as "Real Fancy". The requirement is to check for "not" as a separate word, not just as a substring.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The condition `if "not" in S:` is too broad. It does not ensure that "not" is a standalone word.
   - I need to split the quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words.

4. **Correcting the Approach:**
   - I will split the quote into words using the `split()` method, which will give me a list of words.
   - Then, I will check if "not" is in that list of words.

Now, I will revise the code accordingly.

```python
def classify_quotes():
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    
    # Process each quote
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the quote
        S = input()
        
        # Split the quote into words
        words = S.split()
        
        # Check if the word "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")  # Classify as Real Fancy
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")  # Classify as regularly fancy

# Call the function to execute the solution

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to construct a pyramid of strings based on a given string `S` and answer multiple queries about the occurrences of a smaller string `T` in specific rows of the pyramid. The key concepts involved string manipulation, cyclic indexing, and substring searching.

    The solution involved two main functions: one to construct the `N`-th row of the pyramid by cycling through `S`, and another to count the occurrences of `T` in that row. The approach was straightforward, iterating through the row string to check for matches with `T`. 

    One important aspect was handling large values for `N` (up to 10^9). However, the solution constructed the row string directly for each query, which could be inefficient for large `N`. In practice, this worked for the provided test cases but could lead to performance issues if `N` were significantly larger. 

    The final implementation successfully passed the provided test cases, demonstrating that the logic for substring counting and cyclic string construction was sound. Future improvements could focus on optimizing the row construction to avoid unnecessary string concatenation for large `N`. 

    Here’s the core code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def count_occurrences(row_string, T):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(row_string) - len(T) + 1):
            if row_string[i:i + len(T)] == T:
                count += 1
        return count

    def get_row_string(S, N):
        row_string = ""
        for i in range(N):
            row_string += S[i % len(S)]
        return row_string
    ``` 

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of considering performance implications when dealing with potentially large inputs in string manipulation problems.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by removing one character from a given string and reinserting it at any position. The solution involved iterating through each character, removing it, and then trying to insert it back into every possible position in the remaining string. 

    The core concept tested here was the manipulation of strings and understanding of lexicographical order. The approach of generating all possible strings by removing and reinserting characters was effective, and the use of comparisons to track the smallest string worked as intended.

    The final implementation involved reading multiple test cases, processing each string, and outputting the results. The code was structured to first define the main function and then handle input/output, ensuring clarity and separation of logic. The solution passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. 

    Key code snippet:
    ```python
    for i in range(N):  # Iterate through each character
        char_to_move = S[i]  # Character to move
        remaining_string = S[:i] + S[i+1:]  # Remove the character
        for j in range(N):  # Try to insert the character at every position
            new_string = remaining_string[:j] + char_to_move + remaining_string[j:]
            if new_string < smallest_string:  # Check if the new string is smaller
                smallest_string = new_string  # Update smallest string
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of string manipulation techniques and careful iteration when solving combinatorial problems.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to repeatedly remove the substring "abc" from given strings until no such occurrences remained. The solution involved using a loop to check for the presence of "abc" and removing it iteratively. The approach was straightforward and effective, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities.

    The core concept tested here was the ability to handle string modifications dynamically, which is a common pattern in string processing problems. The solution utilized a while loop combined with the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "abc" each time it was found. This method ensured that the string was updated correctly after each removal.

    The final implementation was successful, as it passed all test cases without any errors. The code was structured with a main function to handle input and output, and a helper function to perform the removal of "abc". This modular approach made the code clean and easy to understand. Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of iterative string processing and the utility of built-in string methods in Python.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
"I don't have any fancy quotes." - vijju123
Chef was reading some quotes by great people. Now, he is interested in classifying all the fancy quotes he knows. He thinks that all fancy quotes which contain the word "not" are Real Fancy; quotes that do not contain it are regularly fancy.
You are given some quotes. For each quote, you need to tell Chef if it is Real Fancy or just regularly fancy.

-----Input-----
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains a single string $S$ denoting a quote.

-----Output-----
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "Real Fancy" or "regularly fancy" (without quotes).

-----Constraints-----
- $1 \le T \le 50$
- $1 \le |S| \le 100$
- each character of $S$ is either a lowercase English letter or a space

-----Subtasks-----

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to classify quotes based on whether they contain the word "not". If a quote contains "not", it is classified as "Real Fancy"; otherwise, it is classified as "regularly fancy". We need to process multiple quotes and provide the classification for each.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Read the number of quotes (test cases).
   - For each quote, check if the word "not" is present.
   - If "not" is found, classify the quote as "Real Fancy"; if not, classify it as "regularly fancy".
   - Print the classification for each quote.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function classify_quotes():
       read integer T  // number of test cases
       for i from 1 to T:
           read string S  // the quote
           if "not" in S:
               print "Real Fancy"
           else:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   The goal is to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". If "not" appears as a standalone word in the quote, it should be classified as "Real Fancy". If it does not appear, it should be classified as "regularly fancy".

2. **Identifying the Issue:**
   The current implementation checks for the substring "not" in the quote. This means that it would incorrectly classify quotes that contain "not" as part of another word (e.g., "nothing") as "Real Fancy". The requirement is to check for "not" as a separate word, not just as a substring.

3. **Where I Went Wrong:**
   - The condition `if "not" in S:` is too broad. It does not ensure that "not" is a standalone word.
   - I need to split the quote into words and check if "not" is one of those words.

4. **Correcting the Approach:**
   - I will split the quote into words using the `split()` method, which will give me a list of words.
   - Then, I will check if "not" is in that list of words.

Now, I will revise the code accordingly.

```python
def classify_quotes():
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    
    # Process each quote
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the quote
        S = input()
        
        # Split the quote into words
        words = S.split()
        
        # Check if the word "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")  # Classify as Real Fancy
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")  # Classify as regularly fancy

# Call the function to execute the solution

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [prompt] Here is the corrected Python code that checks for the presence of the word "not" as a standalone word in each quote. This version splits the quote into words and checks if "not" is one of them:

```python

    - Describing the strategies that seemed to work but did not, and vice versa
    - Describing unexpected errors and how they were fixed

Your summary should be at most a few paragraphs.

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to classify quotes based on the presence of the word "not". Initially, I incorrectly checked for the substring "not" in the quotes, which led to misclassifications when "not" appeared as part of other words (e.g., "nothing"). 

The key concept was to ensure that "not" was treated as a standalone word. The solution required splitting each quote into individual words and checking for the presence of "not" in that list. This approach effectively resolved the issue.

The final working code snippet is as follows:

```python
def classify_quotes():
    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    
    # Process each quote
    for _ in range(T):
        # Read the quote
        S = input()
        
        # Split the quote into words
        words = S.split()
        
        # Check if the word "not" is in the list of words
        if "not" in words:
            print("Real Fancy")  # Classify as Real Fancy
        else:
            print("regularly fancy")  # Classify as regularly fancy

# Call the function to execute the solution
classify_quotes()
```

This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem requirements thoroughly and ensuring that checks for specific words are done correctly, especially in string manipulation tasks.

 else:

INFO - [Task id] 1551 [generation text] In this experience, I learned the importance of checking for standalone words rather than just substrings when classifying text. My initial solution incorrectly identified quotes containing "not" as part of other words (like "nothing") as "Real Fancy". The official solution effectively addresses this by splitting the input string into a list of words and checking for the presence of "not" in that list.

The official solution uses the `split()` method to break the quote into words, which is similar to my approach. However, it also utilizes a while loop to manage the number of test cases, which is a straightforward way to handle multiple inputs. This method ensures that each quote is processed correctly and efficiently.

Key insights from the official solution:
- Always ensure that checks for specific words account for word boundaries to avoid false positives.
- Using a list to store words from the input string allows for easy membership testing with the `in` operator.
- Managing multiple test cases can be done effectively with a loop that decrements a counter.

Overall, this experience reinforced the importance of careful string manipulation and the need to consider edge cases in text processing tasks.
