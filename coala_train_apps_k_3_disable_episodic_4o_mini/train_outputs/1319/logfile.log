## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The king wants to eliminate corrupt citizens based on their wealth. Citizens declare their wealth one by one, and whenever the king visits, the prime minister must identify and behead the richest citizen who has declared their wealth up to that point and is still alive. The input consists of a sequence of wealth declarations and king's visits, and the output should be the wealth of the citizens beheaded during each of the king's visits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   We need to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they declare it. When the king visits, we need to quickly find the richest citizen who has declared their wealth and has not been beheaded yet. To do this efficiently, we can use a max-heap (or a priority queue) to keep track of the wealth of citizens. Each time a citizen declares their wealth, we add it to the heap. When the king visits, we pop the maximum wealth from the heap, which represents the richest citizen to be beheaded. We also need to ensure that we only consider citizens who are still alive.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize an empty max-heap
   Initialize an empty list for results

   For each input line:
       If the line is a positive integer (wealth):
           Push the wealth into the max-heap
       Else if the line is -1 (king's visit):
           Pop the maximum wealth from the max-heap
           Append this wealth to the results list

   Print each wealth in the results list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

import heapq

def behead_citizens():
    # Read the first line of input to get N and M
    first_line = input().strip().split()
    N = int(first_line[0])
    M = int(first_line[1])
    
    # Initialize a max-heap (using negative values for max-heap simulation)
    max_heap = []
    results = []
    
    # Process each of the next N + M lines
    for _ in range(N + M):
        line = input().strip()
        if line == '-1':
            # King visits, pop the richest citizen from the heap
            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # Negate to get the original wealth
            results.append(richest)
        else:
            # Citizen declares their wealth

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead achieved by either player at the end of any round, rather than simply summing their scores. The problem required careful tracking of cumulative scores and leads after each round.

    The solution involved reading the number of rounds and the scores for each player, updating cumulative scores, and calculating the lead for each round. The maximum lead and the corresponding winner were tracked throughout the rounds. The implementation was straightforward, leveraging basic arithmetic and conditional statements to determine the leader and maximum lead.

    The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and it passed the provided test case without any issues. Key concepts included cumulative score tracking, lead calculation, and conditional logic to determine the winner based on maximum lead. This experience reinforced the importance of maintaining state across iterations and the need for clear logic when comparing values. 

    The final code snippet is as follows:

    ```python
    def find_winner():
        N = int(input())
        cumulative_score_player1 = 0
        cumulative_score_player2 = 0
        max_lead = 0
        winner = 0

        for _ in range(N):
            S1, S2 = map(int, input().split())
            cumulative_score_player1 += S1
            cumulative_score_player2 += S2
        
            if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:
                lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2
                if lead > max_lead:
                    max_lead = lead
                    winner = 1
            else:
                lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1
                if lead > max_lead:
                    max_lead = lead
                    winner = 2

        print(winner, max_lead)

    find_winner()
    ``` 

    This solution effectively meets the problem's requirements and demonstrates a clear understanding of the necessary logic and data handling.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main challenge was to correctly handle team names that could be presented in any order due to character rearrangement. The goal was to accumulate scores for each team based on their submissions while ensuring that teams with the same character composition were treated as identical.

    The initial approach involved using a normalized version of the team names (sorted characters) as keys in a dictionary to accumulate scores. However, this led to the loss of the original team names, which was crucial for the final output. The output format required the original team names to be printed alongside their scores, sorted by score and then lexicographically by name.

    The solution was refined by storing tuples in the dictionary that included both the original team name and the accumulated score. This allowed for proper retrieval and sorting of results. The final implementation successfully passed all tests by ensuring that the output matched the expected format.

    Key takeaways:
    - Always retain necessary information (like original names) when normalizing data for processing.
    - Sorting and output formatting are critical in competitive programming problems, especially when multiple criteria are involved. 

    Final working code snippet:
    ```python
    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()

        index += 1
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R
            index += 1
        
            scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores
        
            # Process first half hour submissions
            for _ in range(R):
                line = data[index].split()
                team_name = line[0]
                points = int(line[1])
                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name
                if normalized_name not in scores:
                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score
                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)

                index += 1
        
            # Prepare result for sorting
            result = [(name, score) for normalized_name, (name, score) in scores.items()]
            # Sort by score (descending) and then by team name (lexicographical)
            result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))
        
            # Print the results

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof at the origin (0, 0) based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). 

    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.

    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum. The approach was straightforward and worked well within the constraints provided. 

    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently handling input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. The solution utilized a linear search for counting walls, which was acceptable given the constraints, but could be optimized further with binary search if necessary. Overall, the solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        index = 0
        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases
        index += 1
    
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls
            index += 1
        
            walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions
            index += 1
        
            Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries
            index += 1

                index += 1
            
                sum_xy = x_j + y_j
            
                # Check if the point lies on any wall
                if sum_xy in walls:
                    results.append(-1)
                else:
                    # Count how many walls are greater than sum_xy
                    count = 0
                    for wall in walls:
                        if wall > sum_xy:
                            count += 1
                    results.append(count)

        for res in results:
            print(res)

   The problem involves a king who wants to eliminate corrupt citizens based on their wealth. Citizens declare their wealth one by one, and whenever the king enters the court, the prime minister must identify and behead the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive. The task is to determine which citizens are beheaded during the king's visits based on the wealth declared.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   We need to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they declare it. When the king enters, we should be able to quickly find the richest citizen who has declared their wealth and is still alive. To do this efficiently, we can use a list to store the wealth of citizens and a variable to keep track of the richest alive citizen. Each time the king enters, we will check this list to find the richest citizen, remove them from the list (indicating they are no longer alive), and record their wealth.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Initialize an empty list to store the wealth of citizens
   Initialize an empty list to store the results of beheaded citizens

   Read N and M from input
   For each of the next N + M lines:
       If the line is a positive integer (wealth):
           Append this wealth to the citizens' list
       Else if the line is -1 (king's visit):
           Find the maximum wealth in the citizens' list
           Append this wealth to the results list
           Remove this wealth from the citizens' list (indicating the citizen is beheaded)

   Print each wealth in the results list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_beheaded_citizens():
    # Initialize an empty list to store the wealth of citizens
    citizens = []
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of beheaded citizens
    results = []

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

-----Input:-----
The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

-----Output:-----
Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

-----Constraints:-----
- $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
- $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
- You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] In this task, the goal was to implement a solution for a problem involving a king who beheads the richest citizen present in court during his visits. The approach required efficiently tracking the wealth of citizens as they declared it and quickly identifying the richest citizen during each of the king's visits.

The core concept involved using a list to store the wealth of citizens and leveraging the `max()` function to find the richest citizen when the king entered. The solution effectively handled the input format, distinguishing between wealth declarations and the king's visits. The removal of the beheaded citizen's wealth from the list was crucial to ensure that subsequent visits reflected the correct state of alive citizens.

The implemented solution was straightforward and worked as expected, passing all tests. The key takeaway was the importance of maintaining an updated list of citizens and efficiently managing wealth declarations and removals. The solution demonstrated that using built-in functions like `max()` and list operations can effectively solve problems involving dynamic data tracking.

- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

    else:
        l.append(w)
        leng+=1

INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] The official solution takes a different approach to manage the wealth of citizens and the king's visits. Instead of using a list to store the wealth and then searching for the maximum wealth each time the king visits, it maintains a separate index to track the length of the list. This allows for a more efficient way to find the richest citizen who is still alive.

Key insights from the official solution:

1. **List Management**: The solution uses a list `l` to store the wealth of citizens and a variable `leng` to keep track of how many citizens have declared their wealth. This avoids unnecessary operations on the list.

2. **Finding the Richest**: When the king visits (indicated by `-1`), the solution iterates through the list up to `leng` to find the maximum wealth and its index. This is done in a single pass, which is efficient given the constraints.

3. **Marking Citizens as Beheaded**: Instead of removing the wealth from the list, the solution marks the wealth of the beheaded citizen as `-1`. This avoids the overhead of list operations like `remove`, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.

4. **Output**: The wealth of the beheaded citizen is printed immediately after finding it, which simplifies the output process.

Overall, the official solution is more efficient in terms of time complexity, especially when handling a large number of citizens and visits. It effectively reduces the need for repeated list operations, which can be a bottleneck in performance. This experience highlights the importance of considering data structure choices and their implications on performance in algorithm design.

INFO - Updated entry: The official solution takes a different approach to manage the wealth of citizens and the king's visits. Instead of using a list to store the wealth and then searching for the maximum wealth each time the king visits, it maintains a separate index to track the length of the list. This allows for ...,

The main function is `find_beheaded_citizens`.
INFO - [Task id] 1319 [generation text] This function processes a series of inputs representing the wealth of citizens and the king's visits. It maintains a list of citizens' wealth and, upon each king's visit (indicated by a -1 input), identifies and removes the wealthiest citizen from the list, recording their wealth. The function reads a total of N + M lines, where N represents the number of citizens and M the number of king's visits. After processing all inputs, it outputs the wealth of each beheaded citizen in the order they were removed. The function ensures that only positive integers are added to the citizens' list, while the king's visit triggers the removal of the richest citizen. Ultimately, it provides a record of the wealth of those who were beheaded.

[Problem]
    A despotic king decided that his kingdom needed to be rid of corruption and disparity. He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.
    The wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.
    The king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family â€¦) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.
    Suppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is
    1376518911241376518911241\; 3\; 7\; 6\; 5\; 18\;  9\; 11\;  2\; 4
    and the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.
    At the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.
    You may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.
    Your aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.

    -----Input:-----
    The first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.
    The next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.

    -----Output:-----
    Your output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.

    -----Constraints:-----
    - $1 \leq M \leq 10000$.
    - $1 \leq N \leq 100000$.
    - You may assume that in $50 \%$ of the inputs $1 \leq M \leq 1000$ and $1 \leq N \leq 8000$.
