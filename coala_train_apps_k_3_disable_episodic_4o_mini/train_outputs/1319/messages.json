He called his prime minister and ordered that all corrupt citizens be put to death. Moreover, he wanted this done quickly.\nThe wily prime minister realised that investigating every citizen to decide who was corrupt and who was not was rather difficult. So he decided on the following plan: He ordered all the citizens to appear in the court one by one and declare their wealth.\nThe king does not sit in the court all the time (he has other important business to attend to - for instance, meet dignitaries from neighbouring kingdoms, spend time with his family \u2026) Whenever the king walks into the court, the prime minister pulls out the richest man who has appeared before the court so far and is still alive and beheads him for being corrupt. Since the rich are more likely to be corrupt, he hopes to get rid of most of the corrupt and the king is happy as he sees his policy being implemented enthusiastically.\nSuppose the wealth of the citizens trooping into the court is\n1376518911241376518911241\\; 3\\; 7\\; 6\\; 5\\; 18\\;  9\\; 11\\;  2\\; 4\nand the king walked in three times: the first time after the first four persons have seen the minister, the second time after the first five persons have seen the minister and, finally after the first nine persons have seen the minister.\nAt the king's first visit the richest person to have met the minister has wealth $7$ and he would be beheaded. At the second visit, the wealth of the richest person who has met the minister and is still alive has wealth $6$ and so he would be beheaded. At the third visit the richest person to have met the minister who is still alive has wealth $18$ and so he would be beheaded.\nYou may assume that the input is such that whenever the king walks in, it is always possible to behead someone.\nYour aim is to write a program that will enable the prime minister to identify the richest man to have met the minister and who is still alive quickly. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth.\n\n-----Input:-----\nThe first line of the input consists of two numbers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of citizens in the kingdom and M is the number of visits to the court by the king.\nThe next $N+M$ lines describe the order in which the $N$ citizens' appearances are interleaved with the $M$ visits by the king. A citizen's visit is denoted by a positive integer, signifying his wealth. You may assume that no two citizens have the same wealth. A visit by the king is denoted by $-1$.\n\n-----Output:-----\nYour output should consist of $M$ lines, where the $i^{th}$ line contains the wealth of the citizen who is beheaded at the $i^{th}$ visit of the king.\n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 10000$.\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$.\n- You may assume that in $50 \\%$ of the inputs $1 \\leq M \\leq 1000$ and $1 \\leq N \\leq 8000$.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n10 3\n1 \n3 \n7 \n6 \n-1 \n5 \n-1 \n18 \n9 \n11\n2\n-1\n4\n\n-----Sample Output-----\n7\n6\n18\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   The king wants to eliminate corrupt citizens based on their wealth. Citizens declare their wealth one by one, and whenever the king visits, the prime minister must identify and behead the richest citizen who has declared their wealth up to that point and is still alive. The input consists of a sequence of wealth declarations and king's visits, and the output should be the wealth of the citizens beheaded during each of the king's visits.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   We need to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they declare it. When the king visits, we need to quickly find the richest citizen who has declared their wealth and has not been beheaded yet. To do this efficiently, we can use a max-heap (or a priority queue) to keep track of the wealth of citizens. Each time a citizen declares their wealth, we add it to the heap. When the king visits, we pop the maximum wealth from the heap, which represents the richest citizen to be beheaded. We also need to ensure that we only consider citizens who are still alive.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty max-heap\n   Initialize an empty list for results\n\n   For each input line:\n       If the line is a positive integer (wealth):\n           Push the wealth into the max-heap\n       Else if the line is -1 (king's visit):\n           Pop the maximum wealth from the max-heap\n           Append this wealth to the results list\n\n   Print each wealth in the results list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef behead_citizens():\n    # Read the first line of input to get N and M\n    first_line = input().strip().split()\n    N = int(first_line[0])\n    M = int(first_line[1])\n    \n    # Initialize a max-heap (using negative values for max-heap simulation)\n    max_heap = []\n    results = []\n    \n    # Process each of the next N + M lines\n    for _ in range(N + M):\n        line = input().strip()\n        if line == '-1':\n            # King visits, pop the richest citizen from the heap\n            richest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # Negate to get the original wealth\n            results.append(richest)\n        else:\n            # Citizen declares their wealth\n            wealth = int(line)\n            heapq.heappush(max_heap, -wealth)  # Negate to simulate max-heap\n    \n    # Output the results for each king's visit\n    for result in results:\n        print(result)\n\n```"

The problem required careful tracking of cumulative scores and leads after each round.\n\n    The solution involved reading the number of rounds and the scores for each player, updating cumulative scores, and calculating the lead for each round. The maximum lead and the corresponding winner were tracked throughout the rounds. The implementation was straightforward, leveraging basic arithmetic and conditional statements to determine the leader and maximum lead.\n\n    The final code successfully handled the input and output requirements, and it passed the provided test case without any issues. Key concepts included cumulative score tracking, lead calculation, and conditional logic to determine the winner based on maximum lead. This experience reinforced the importance of maintaining state across iterations and the need for clear logic when comparing values. \n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def find_winner():\n        N = int(input())\n        cumulative_score_player1 = 0\n        cumulative_score_player2 = 0\n        max_lead = 0\n        winner = 0\n\n        for _ in range(N):\n            S1, S2 = map(int, input().split())\n            cumulative_score_player1 += S1\n            cumulative_score_player2 += S2\n        \n            if cumulative_score_player1 > cumulative_score_player2:\n                lead = cumulative_score_player1 - cumulative_score_player2\n                if lead > max_lead:\n                    max_lead = lead\n                    winner = 1\n            else:\n                lead = cumulative_score_player2 - cumulative_score_player1\n                if lead > max_lead:\n                    max_lead = lead\n                    winner = 2\n\n        print(winner, max_lead)\n\n    find_winner()\n    ``` \n\n    This solution effectively meets the problem's requirements and demonstrates a clear understanding of the necessary logic and data handling.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the main challenge was to correctly handle team names that could be presented in any order due to character rearrangement. The goal was to accumulate scores for each team based on their submissions while ensuring that teams with the same character composition were treated as identical.\n\n    The initial approach involved using a normalized version of the team names (sorted characters) as keys in a dictionary to accumulate scores. However, this led to the loss of the original team names, which was crucial for the final output. The output format required the original team names to be printed alongside their scores, sorted by score and then lexicographically by name.\n\n    The solution was refined by storing tuples in the dictionary that included both the original team name and the accumulated score. This allowed for proper retrieval and sorting of results. The final implementation successfully passed all tests by ensuring that the output matched the expected format.\n\n    Key takeaways:\n    - Always retain necessary information (like original names) when normalizing data for processing.\n    - Sorting and output formatting are critical in competitive programming problems, especially when multiple criteria are involved. \n\n    Final working code snippet:\n    ```python\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, R = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read N and R\n            index += 1\n        \n            scores = {}  # Dictionary to hold team scores\n        \n            # Process first half hour submissions\n            for _ in range(R):\n                line = data[index].split()\n                team_name = line[0]\n                points = int(line[1])\n                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n                if normalized_name not in scores:\n                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)\n                index += 1\n        \n            # Process remaining submissions\n            for _ in range(N - R):\n                line = data[index].split()\n                team_name = line[0]\n                points = int(line[1])\n                normalized_name = ''.join(sorted(team_name))  # Normalize team name\n                if normalized_name not in scores:\n                    scores[normalized_name] = (team_name, 0)  # Store original name and score\n                scores[normalized_name] = (scores[normalized_name][0], scores[normalized_name][1] + points)\n                index += 1\n        \n            # Prepare result for sorting\n            result = [(name, score) for normalized_name, (name, score) in scores.items()]\n            # Sort by score (descending) and then by team name (lexicographical)\n            result.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n        \n            # Print the results\n            for team_name, score in result:\n                print(team_name, score)\n\n    # Call the main function to execute the code\n    main()\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine how many walls Chef needs to break through to reach Dr. Doof at the origin (0, 0) based on given wall positions and Chef's starting coordinates. The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). \n\n    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.\n\n    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum. The approach was straightforward and worked well within the constraints provided. \n\n    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently handling input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. The solution utilized a linear search for counting walls, which was acceptable given the constraints, but could be optimized further with binary search if necessary. Overall, the solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls\n            index += 1\n        \n            walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions\n            index += 1\n        \n            Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                x_j, y_j = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read query coordinates\n                index += 1\n            \n                sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                # Check if the point lies on any wall\n                if sum_xy in walls:\n                    results.append(-1)\n                else:\n                    # Count how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                    count = 0\n                    for wall in walls:\n                        if wall > sum_xy:\n                            count += 1\n                    results.append(count)\n    \n        # Print all results for all queries\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    # Call the solve function to execute the code\n    solve()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies employed, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This avoids unnecessary operations on the list.\n\n2. **Finding the Richest**: When the king visits (indicated by `-1`), the solution iterates through the list up to `leng` to find the maximum wealth and its index. This is done in a single pass, which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n3. **Marking Citizens as Beheaded**: Instead of removing the wealth from the list, the solution marks the wealth of the beheaded citizen as `-1`. This avoids the overhead of list operations like `remove`, which can be costly in terms of time complexity.\n\n4. **Output**: The wealth of the beheaded citizen is printed immediately after finding it, which simplifies the output process.\n\nOverall, the official solution is more efficient in terms of time complexity, especially when handling a large number of citizens and visits.
