    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:\n   The problem involves a king who wants to eliminate corrupt citizens based on their wealth. Citizens declare their wealth one by one, and whenever the king enters the court, the prime minister must identify and behead the richest citizen who has appeared so far and is still alive. The task is to determine which citizens are beheaded during the king's visits based on the wealth declared.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   We need to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they declare it. When the king enters, we should be able to quickly find the richest citizen who has declared their wealth and is still alive. To do this efficiently, we can use a list to store the wealth of citizens and a variable to keep track of the richest alive citizen. Each time the king enters, we will check this list to find the richest citizen, remove them from the list (indicating they are no longer alive), and record their wealth.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty list to store the wealth of citizens\n   Initialize an empty list to store the results of beheaded citizens\n\n   Read N and M from input\n   For each of the next N + M lines:\n       If the line is a positive integer (wealth):\n           Append this wealth to the citizens' list\n       Else if the line is -1 (king's visit):\n           Find the maximum wealth in the citizens' list\n           Append this wealth to the results list\n           Remove this wealth from the citizens' list (indicating the citizen is beheaded)\n\n   Print each wealth in the results list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_beheaded_citizens():\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the wealth of citizens\n    citizens = []\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of beheaded citizens\n    results = []\n\n    # Read N and M from input\n    N, M = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    # For each of the next N + M lines\n    for _ in range(N + M):\n        line = int(input())\n        # If the line is a positive integer (wealth)\n        if line > 0:\n            citizens.append(line)  # Append this wealth to the citizens' list\n        else:  # If the line is -1 (king's visit)\n            # Find the maximum wealth in the citizens' list\n            richest = max(citizens)\n            results.append(richest)  # Append this wealth to the results list\n            citizens.remove(richest)  # Remove this wealth from the citizens' list (indicating the citizen is beheaded)\n\n    # Print each wealth in the results list\n    for wealth in results:\n        print(wealth)\n\n# Call the function to execute the code\nfind_beheaded_citizens()\n```",
