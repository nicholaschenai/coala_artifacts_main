Both gates have two input lines and one output line. The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.\n\nYou are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.\n\nNow consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).\n\nEach test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.\n\nAs stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.\n\nTest cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p. The value p should be printed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1\n0\n\n3\n0\n0\n1 1 2\n\n3\n0\n0\n2 1 2\n\n5\n0\n0\n0\n2 1 2\n1 3 4\n\nOutput:\n\n0.50000\n0.29289\n0.70711\n0.40303\n\n-----Temporary Stuff-----\n\nA horizontal rule follows.\n\n***\n\nHere's a definition list (with `definitionLists` option):\n\napples\n: Good for making applesauce.\noranges\n: Citrus!\ntomatoes\n: There's no \"e\" in tomatoe.\n\n#PRACTICE\n- This must be done\n[http:codechef.com/users/dpraveen](http:codechef.com/users/dpraveen)\n\n(0.8944272\u22120.44721360.4472136\u22120.8944272)(10005)(0.89442720.4472136\u22120.4472136\u22120.8944272)(10005)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n0.8944272 & 0.4472136\\\\\n-0.4472136 & -0.8944272\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \n10 & 0\\\\ \n0 & 5\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each input can independently be set to 1 with probability `p` or to 0 with probability `1-p`. The circuit is defined by a series of nodes, where some nodes are inputs (0) and others are gates (1 for OR, 2 for AND) that take inputs from previous nodes.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the output of the circuit based on the type of gates and their connections. We can represent the output probability of each node in terms of `p`. For an AND gate, the output is 1 if both inputs are 1, which gives us a probability of `p^2`. For an OR gate, the output is 1 if at least one input is 1, which gives us a probability of `1 - (1-p)^2`.

The pattern required printing \\( K \\) lines for each test case, where each line \\( i \\) contains \\( i \\) characters.\n\n    The solution involved iterating through each test case and constructing the required lines by checking the index of each character to determine whether to append '1' or '0'. The implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the constraints provided.\n\n    One key aspect was ensuring that the output format matched the expected results, which involved printing each line immediately after constructing it. The solution was efficient and adhered to the problem's requirements without any external libraries.\n\n    The final code snippet is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n        for K in test_cases:\n            for i in range(1, K + 1):\n                line = \"\"\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if j % 2 == 0:\n

Then, the probability $P(A)$ of an event\n    $A$ can be calculated as a sum\n    of probabilities of outcomes using the formula\n    \\[P(A) = \\sum_{x \\in A} p(x).\\]\n    For example, when

using complements by solving the opposite problem.\n    For example, the probability of getting\n    at least one six when throwing a dice ten times is\n    \\[1-(5/6)^{10}.\\]\n\n    Here $5/6$ is the probability that the outcome\n    of a single throw is not six, and\n    $(5/6)^{10}$ is the probability that none of\n    the ten throws is a six.\n    The complement of this is the answer to the

        "content": "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Code\n\n1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the input and splits it into lines. It correctly identifies the number of test cases and processes each test case. However, it does not handle the blank lines properly, which can lead to incorrect indexing.\n\n2. **Node Representation**: The nodes are represented as tuples, where the first element indicates the type (input, OR, AND) and the subsequent elements are the indices of the inputs for gates. This part seems correct.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation**: The function `calculate_probability` is designed to return a lambda function that computes the probability based on the type of node. However, it returns `None` for input nodes, which is not handled correctly when calculating the output probability.\n\n4. **Finding Probability \\( p \\)**: The binary search function `find_p_for_half_probability` attempts to find the value of \\( p \\) such that the output probability equals 1/2. The issue arises because the lambda functions returned by `calculate_probability` are not being evaluated correctly, especially for input nodes.\n\n5. **Output Formatting**: The results are formatted correctly, but if the calculations fail or return `None`, it will lead to runtime errors.\n\n### Where the Code Went Wrong\n\n1. **Handling Input Nodes**: The `calculate_probability` function should return a function that computes the probability based on \\( p \\) for input nodes, rather than returning `None`. This is crucial for the probability calculations to work correctly.\n\n2. **Probability Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the output probability for AND and OR gates needs to ensure that it correctly evaluates the probabilities of its input nodes, which are also functions of \\( p \\).\n\n3. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search should ensure that it checks the output probability against 0.5 correctly, and the evaluation of the lambda functions must be done properly.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\n1. Modify the `calculate_probability` function to return a valid probability function for input nodes.\n2. Ensure that the output probability calculations for AND and OR gates correctly evaluate the probabilities of their input nodes.\n3. Adjust the binary search to correctly evaluate the output probability against 0.5.\n\n### Revised Python Solution\n```python\ndef calculate_probability(node, nodes):\n    if nodes[node][0] == 0:  # Input node\n        return lambda p: p  # Probability is p for input nodes\n    elif nodes[node][0] == 1:  # OR gate\n        a, b = nodes[node][1], nodes[node][2]\n        return lambda p: 1 - (1 - calculate_probability(a, nodes)(p)) * (1 - calculate_probability(b, nodes)(p))\n    elif nodes[node][0] == 2:  # AND gate\n        a, b = nodes[node][1], nodes[node][2]\n        return lambda p: calculate_probability(a, nodes)(p) * calculate_probability(b, nodes)(p)\n\ndef find_p_for_half_probability(nodes):\n    low, high = 0.0, 1.0\n    while high - low > 1e-7:  # Precision for binary search\n        mid = (low + high) / 2\n        if calculate_probability(len(nodes) - 1, nodes)(mid) < 0.5:\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return (low + high) / 2\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split('\\n')\n    \n    index = 0\n    results = []\n    T = int(data[index])\n    index += 1\n    \n    for _ in range(T):\n        if data[index] == '':\n            index += 1  # Skip blank line\n        n = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        \n        nodes = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            line = list(map(int, data[index].split()))\n            if line[0] == 0:\n                nodes.append((0,))  # Input node\n            else:\n                nodes.append((line[0], line[1] - 1, line[2] - 1))  # Gate node\n            index += 1\n        \n        p = find_p_for_half_probability(nodes)\n        results.append(f\"{p:.5f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n\".join(results))\n\nmain()\n```\n\nThis revised code should correctly handle the input nodes and calculate the probabilities, allowing it to pass all tests."

The initial approach involved deriving a formula based on the observed pattern, but the formula used was incorrect. The series was actually generated by summing the squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers.\n\n    The correct approach involved recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms were perfect squares, leading to the realization that T(N) = T(N-1) + (N-1)^2. This insight allowed for the implementation of a function that computes the N'th term by iterating through the first (N-1) integers and summing their squares.\n\n    The final working code is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_nth_number(n):\n        if n == 1:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            total = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                total += i * i  # Sum of squares of the first (N-1) natural numbers\n            return total\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])  # Read number of test cases\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])  # Read each test case\n            nth_number = calculate_nth_number(N)  # Calculate the N'th number\n            results.append(nth_number)  # Store the result\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of carefully analyzing patterns in sequences and the need to validate derived formulas against known values.

The walls are represented by line segments defined by points (a_i, 0) and (0, a_i). \n\n    The core concept involved checking if Chef's starting point lies on any wall and counting how many walls are above the line defined by the sum of Chef's coordinates. The solution required efficiently processing multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the checks for wall positions were done correctly.\n\n    The implemented solution involved reading input data, checking if the sum of coordinates matched any wall position, and counting walls that were greater than this sum. The approach was straightforward and worked well within the constraints provided. \n\n    One key takeaway was the importance of efficiently handling input and output, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets. The solution utilized a linear search for counting walls, which was acceptable given the constraints, but could be optimized further with binary search if necessary. Overall, the solution was effective, and no unexpected errors were encountered during implementation. \n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])  # Read number of test cases\n        index += 1\n    \n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N = int(data[index])  # Read number of walls\n            index += 1\n        \n            walls = list(map(int, data[index].split()))  # Read wall positions\n            index += 1\n        \n            Q = int(data[index])  # Read number of queries\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                x_j, y_j = map(int, data[index].split())  # Read query coordinates\n                index += 1\n            \n                sum_xy = x_j + y_j\n            \n                # Check if the point lies on any wall\n                if sum_xy in walls:\n                    results.append(-1)\n                else:\n                    # Count how many walls are greater than sum_xy\n                    count = 0\n                    for wall in walls:\n                        if wall > sum_xy:\n                            count += 1\n                    results.append(count)\n    \n        # Print all results for all queries\n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    # Call the solve function to execute the code\n    solve()\n    ``` \n\n    This summary encapsulates the problem-solving process, the strategies employed, and the final solution for future reference.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to compute the sum of values from a list of bills for multiple queries efficiently. The key concept utilized was the prefix sum array, which allows for quick calculations of subarray sums. By precomputing the cumulative sums, each query could be answered in constant time.\n\n    Initially, the code was structured correctly, but it failed to execute because the `solve()` function was not called. This oversight led to no output being produced. Additionally, I ensured that the results were printed directly as integers, which aligned with the expected output format.\n\n    The final solution effectively reads input, constructs the prefix sum array, processes each query, and outputs the results. The successful implementation demonstrated the importance of function calls and proper output formatting in Python.

While this approach was fundamentally sound, it had some shortcomings in handling input nodes and evaluating probabilities correctly, which led to runtime errors in certain test cases.\n\nThe official solution provided a more structured approach by defining a `node` class to encapsulate the properties of each node in the circuit. This encapsulation allowed for clearer management of node attributes and dependencies. The recursive `finder` function effectively traverses the circuit, calculating probabilities based on the type of gate encountered. The use of a binary search to find the value of \\( p \\) was also well-implemented, ensuring precision through a small epsilon value.\n\nKey insights from the official solution include:\n1. **Node Class Structure**: Using a class to represent nodes simplifies the management of node properties and relationships.\n2. **Recursive Probability Calculation**: The `finder` function cleanly separates the logic for calculating probabilities for input nodes, AND gates, and OR gates, making the code easier to read and maintain.\n3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search method is effectively used to hone in on the desired probability \\( p \\) with a clear stopping condition based on a defined precision.\n\nOverall, the official solution's clarity and structure highlight the importance of organizing code effectively, especially when dealing with recursive problems and complex data structures.
