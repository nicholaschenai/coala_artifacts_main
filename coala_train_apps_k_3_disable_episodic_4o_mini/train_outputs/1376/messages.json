One day, when he looked at the mess that he made after playing with his rubber ducks, he felt awful. Now he wants to clean up his mess, by placing his ducks into boxes.\nEach rubber duck has a color. There are a total of $N+1$ colors, numbered from $0$ to $N$. Salmon wants to place his $N*K$ ducks into $N$ boxes, each of which can fit $K$ ducks. Each duck should be placed inside a box.\nSalmon is very particular when it comes to how many colors he can place in each box. Since Salmon doesn't like lots of colors mixing together he only wants to have a maximum of $2$ distinct colors per box.\nPlease help Salmon achieve this goal!\n\nIt can be shown that there will always be at least one valid solution under given constraints.\n\nIf there are multiple correct solutions, you may output any one of them.   \n\n-----Input:-----\n- The first line contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of testcases. $T$ testcases will follow, each containing two lines.   \n- The first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $K$.   \n- The second line of each testcase contains $N+1$  space-separated integers. The $i+1$-th integer denotes the number of ducks with color-$i$ where $0 \\leq i \\leq N$\n\n-----Output:-----\n- Output $N$ lines for each testcase. \n- The $i$-th line of a testcase should contain $4$ space-separated integers $c1, m1, c2, m2$ respectively which denotes that that are $m1$ ducks of color-$c1$ and $m2$ ducks of color-$c2$ inside the $i$-th box where $0 \\leq m1,m2 \\leq K$ and $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$. \n- Note that even if you have only one color to put inside the $i$-th box, you should still output $4$ space-separated integers and keep either $m1$ or $m2$ as $0$. And $0 \\leq c1,c2 \\leq N$.\n- The output should be valid and should satisfy Salmon's goal.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $T=10$\n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$ \n- $2 \\leq K \\leq 10^5$ \n- Total ducks for each test case is exactly $N*K$\n- There can be a color with $0$ ducks\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- Subtask 1 [20 points]: $2 \\leq N \\leq 10$, $K=2$ \n- Subtask 2 [30 points]: $N=2$, $K=5$\n- Subtask 3 [50 points]: original constraints\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n1\n2 4\n3 4 1\n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n2 1 1 3\n1 1 0 3\n\n-----Explanation:-----\n- In the given testcase, Salmon has $N=2$ boxes, each of size $K=4$ and there are total $N*K=8$ ducks.   \n- The first box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$2$ and $3$ ducks of color-$1$ and the second box is filled with $1$ duck of color-$1$ and $3$ ducks of color-$0$.   \n- Each duck is inside a box and each box has at most two distinct colors. Also each box contains exactly $K=4$ ducks.\n\nThe output code needs to read from and write to standard IO\n\n\n[END PROBLEM]\n"

Each box can hold a specific number of ducks, and he wants to ensure that each box contains at most two different colors of ducks. The task is to determine how to distribute the ducks into the boxes while adhering to these constraints.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of duck colors and their counts. We will fill each box with ducks, ensuring that we do not exceed the box capacity and that we only use up to two colors per box.

The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money to a group of minions such that he ends up with exactly zero money left. The key concepts involved were understanding the total demand from the minions and ensuring that each individual demand could be satisfied without exceeding the amount of money Gru had at any point.\n\n    Initially, the approach was to simply check if the total demand equaled the amount of money Gru had. However, this was insufficient because it did not account for the individual demands of the minions. The correct approach required checking both the total demand and ensuring that each individual demand was less than or equal to the money Gru had.\n\n    The final solution involved calculating the total demand and checking if it matched Gru's total money. If it did, the output was \"YES\"; otherwise, it was \"NO\". However, the solution failed to pass the tests because it did not consider the scenario where the total demand could be less than Gru's money but still not allow for exact distribution.\n\n    The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of considering both aggregate and individual constraints when solving distribution problems. The final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Extract number of minions and amount of money Gru has\n            A = case[2]  # Extract the list of demands from minions\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)  # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by minions\n        \n            # Check if the total demand equals the money Gru has\n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")  # Gru can distribute the money exactly\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")  # Gru cannot distribute the money as required\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the need for careful consideration of problem constraints and the importance of validating both total and individual conditions in distribution scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to count the number of subsets from a set of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N} where a specific number I appears at a specific position K in the sorted order of the subset. The challenge was to efficiently handle multiple queries, especially given the constraints where N can be as large as 4000 and the number of queries can reach up to 1,000,000.\n\n    The initial attempts focused on calculating binomial coefficients to determine how many ways we could select elements from the set. However, the logic for combining these counts was flawed, particularly in how subsets were counted based on the position of I. The key realization was that for I to be at position K, we needed to choose K-1 elements from those less than I and any number of elements from those greater than I. This led to the use of the expression `2^right_count` to account for all possible subsets from the right side.\n\n    The final solution involved a correct implementation of the binomial coefficient calculation and the use of bit shifting to efficiently compute powers of two. The code was structured to read input, process each query, and output results in a single operation to optimize performance.\n\n    Here\u2019s the final code snippet for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    def binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n        if k > n or k < 0:\n            return 0\n        if k == 0 or k == n:\n            return 1\n        res = 1\n        for i in range(1, k + 1):\n            res = res * (n - i + 1) // i\n        return res\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        index = 0\n        T = int(data[index])\n        index += 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            N, Q = map(int, data[index].split())\n            index += 1\n        \n            for __ in range(Q):\n                I, K = map(int, data[index].split())\n                index += 1\n            \n                if K > N or K < 1 or I < K:\n                    results.append(0)\n                    continue\n            \n                left_count = I - 1\n                right_count = N - I\n            \n                total_subsets = (binomial_coefficient(left_count, K - 1) * (1 << right_count)) % MOD\n                results.append(total_subsets)\n    \n        sys.stdout.write('\\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\\n')\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully analyzing the requirements of combinatorial problems and ensuring that all conditions are accounted for in the calculations.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It did not properly handle the case where only one color was available or when the counts of ducks were not sufficient to fill the box to `K`.\n   - The output format was not strictly adhered to, as it did not ensure that if one color was used, the other color's count was set to `0`.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   - The logic for filling the boxes was not robust enough to handle all edge cases, such as when there are not enough ducks of one color to fill the box or when only one color is available.\n   - The approach to decrementing the counts of ducks was not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. **Iterate through the colors** and fill each box with ducks, ensuring that we only use up to two colors.\n2. **Check the counts** of ducks available and fill the box to exactly `K` ducks.\n3. **Output the results** in the required format.\n\n### Pseudocode for the Revised Solution:\n```\nfunction distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    for each test_case in test_cases:\n        read N and K\n        read the list of duck counts\n        initialize an empty list for boxes\n        while there are still ducks to place:\n            for each box from 1 to N:\n                initialize m1, m2, c1, c2 to 0\n                fill the box with ducks from available colors\n                ensure the box has exactly K ducks\n                append the box configuration to boxes\n        output the contents of each box\n```\n\n### Final Python 3 Solution:\n```python\ndef distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Read number of boxes and capacity of each box\n        ducks = case[2]  # Read the list of duck counts\n        boxes = []  # This will hold the distribution of ducks in each box\n        \n        # Create a list of colors with their counts\n        color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]\n        \n        # Fill each box\n        for _ in range(N):\n            m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box\n            c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box\n            \n            # Try to fill the box with ducks\n            for i in range(len(color_counts)):\n                if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full\n                    if color_counts[i][1] > 0:  # If there are ducks of this color\n                        if c1 == -1:  # First color\n                            c1 = color_counts[i][0]\n                            m1 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible\n                            color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m1)  # Update count\n                        elif c2 == -1:  # Second color\n                            c2 = color_counts[i][0]\n                            m2 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible\n                            color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m2)  # Update count\n            \n            # If we have only one color, ensure the other is set to 0\n            if c2 == -1:\n                c2 = 0\n                m2 = 0\n            \n            # Append the box configuration\n            boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))\n        \n        # Output the boxes\n        for box in boxes:\n            print(box[0], box[1], box[2], box[3])\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K = map(int, input().split())\n    ducks = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    test_cases.append((N, K, ducks))\n\ndistribute_ducks(T, test_cases)\n``` \n\nThis revised solution ensures that we correctly fill each box with the required number of ducks while adhering to the constraints of the problem."

The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.\n\n    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.\n\n    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def max_contests(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n            A = case[3]\n            total_problems = sum(A)\n            contests_possible = total_problems // K\n            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)\n            print(max_contests)\n\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())\n        A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))\n\n    max_contests(T, test_cases)\n    ``` \n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to determine if Gru could distribute his money to a group of minions such that he ends up with exactly zero money left. The key concepts involved were understanding the total demand from the minions and ensuring that each individual demand could be satisfied without exceeding the amount of money Gru had at any point.\n\n    Initially, the approach was to simply check if the total demand equaled the amount of money Gru had. However, this was insufficient because it did not account for the individual demands of the minions. The correct approach required checking both the total demand and ensuring that each individual demand was less than or equal to the money Gru had.\n\n    The final solution involved calculating the total demand and checking if it matched Gru's total money. If it did, the output was \"YES\"; otherwise, it was \"NO\". However, the solution failed to pass the tests because it did not consider the scenario where the total demand could be less than Gru's money but still not allow for exact distribution.\n\n    The key takeaway from this experience is the importance of considering both aggregate and individual constraints when solving distribution problems. The final code snippet that was intended to solve the problem is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def can_distribute_money(T, test_cases):\n        for case in test_cases:\n            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Extract number of minions and amount of money Gru has\n            A = case[2]  # Extract the list of demands from minions\n        \n            total_demand = sum(A)  # Calculate the total amount of money demanded by minions\n        \n            # Check if the total demand equals the money Gru has\n            if total_demand == K:\n                print(\"YES\")  # Gru can distribute the money exactly\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")  # Gru cannot distribute the money as required\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the need for careful consideration of problem constraints and the importance of validating both total and individual conditions in distribution scenarios.\n[/Summary]\n\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to generate a specific pattern of numbers based on an integer input \\( K \\) for multiple test cases. The expected output required alternating lines of numbers, where even-indexed lines counted up from `0` to the line index, and odd-indexed lines counted down from the line index to `0`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Pattern Recognition**: The output pattern alternates between counting up and counting down based on the line index. This was a crucial aspect that needed to be correctly implemented to match the expected output.\n    2. **Logic Implementation**: The initial attempts incorrectly generated lines by not adhering to the specified counting logic. The correct approach involved checking if the line index was even or odd and generating the line accordingly.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    The final corrected code that adheres to the requirements is as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_pattern(T, test_cases):\n        for K in test_cases:\n            for i in range(K):\n                line = \"\"\n                if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index: count up from 0 to i\n                    for j in range(i + 1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                else:  # Odd index: count down from i to 0\n                    for j in range(i, -1, -1):\n                        line += str(j)\n                print(line)\n\n    # Read the number of test cases\n    T = int(input())\n    test_cases = [int(input().strip()) for _ in range(T)]\n    generate_pattern(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    ### Lessons Learned:\n    - It is essential to carefully analyze the output requirements and ensure that the logic implemented matches those requirements.\n    - Alternating patterns can often lead to confusion; clear separation of logic for different cases (even vs. odd) is necessary to avoid errors.\n    - Testing with various inputs can help identify edge cases and ensure the robustness of the solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "In reflecting on my attempts to solve the problem of distributing rubber ducks into boxes, I learned several key insights that can be useful for future problem-solving:\n\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: The problem required careful attention to constraints, specifically that each box must contain exactly `K` ducks and at most two distinct colors. My initial solution struggled with ensuring that the total count in each box was exactly `K`, which led to incorrect outputs.\n\n2. **Efficient Count Management**: The official solution effectively manages the counts of ducks using a dictionary to track the original indices of colors. This allows for efficient retrieval and updating of counts as ducks are placed into boxes. My approach did not utilize such a mapping, which complicated the process of ensuring the correct output format.\n\n3. **Iterative Filling Logic**: The official solution employs a systematic approach to fill boxes, checking if a single color can fill the box or if a combination of two colors is needed. This step-by-step filling process is crucial for maintaining the constraints and ensuring that all ducks are placed correctly.\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The official solution includes specific handling for edge cases, such as when there are only two colors or when one color has enough ducks to fill a box alone. My solution lacked this level of detail, which could lead to failures in certain test cases.\n\n5. **Output Format**: The official solution adheres strictly to the required output format, ensuring that if only one color is used, the second color's count is set to `0`. This is a critical detail that I initially overlooked.\n\nOverall, the experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing counts and adhering to constraints while also ensuring that the output format is correct. The official solution's approach to systematically filling boxes and managing color counts provides a solid framework for tackling similar problems in the future."

For each test case, it reads the number of boxes and their capacity, along with the counts of ducks of different colors. It then attempts to fill each box with up to two different colors of ducks, ensuring that the total does not exceed the box's capacity. If only one color is used, the second color is set to zero. Finally, the configuration of each box is printed, showing the colors and their respective counts. This approach aims to maximize the use of available ducks while adhering to the box capacity limits.\n\n[end of description]\nThis knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to distribute items (in this case, rubber ducks) into containers (boxes) while adhering to specific constraints, such as limiting the number of distinct types (colors) of items in each container. This can apply to various real-world situations, such as organizing inventory in warehouses, packing items for shipping, or even in programming challenges that involve resource allocation. Understanding how to manage constraints effectively can help in optimizing space and ensuring compliance with rules, which is critical in logistics and operations management."
