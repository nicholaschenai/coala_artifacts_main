    "summary": "In this problem, the goal was to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after Chef uses buttons that can either reduce planned tasks (white buttons) or increase completed tasks (black buttons). The challenge involved ensuring that the usage of these buttons adhered to the constraints of not exceeding planned tasks and managing the state of the buttons effectively.\n\nThroughout the attempts, the main issues identified were related to the logic for using the buttons. The initial approach incorrectly handled the conditions for applying black buttons, leading to incorrect calculations of completed tasks. The code also failed to optimally utilize the buttons across multiple days, which resulted in suboptimal outcomes.\n\nKey strategies that were attempted included sorting the buttons in descending order and iterating through them to apply the largest available button first. However, the logic for removing buttons from the list and ensuring that the total completed tasks did not exceed the planned tasks was flawed.\n\nThe final realization was that a more careful management of the remaining tasks and button states was necessary. The code needed to ensure that after each day, the remaining planned tasks were accurately calculated and that buttons were used in a way that maximized their effectiveness across all days.\n\nThe following code snippet represents the last attempt, which still did not yield the correct results:\n\n```python\ndef min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n        A = case[3]\n        B = case[4]\n        C = case[5]\n        D = case[6]\n        \n        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order\n        C.sort(reverse=True)\n        D.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        total_uncompleted = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through each day\n        for i in range(N):\n            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks\n            \n            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks\n            for white in C:\n                if remaining_planned <= 0:\n                    break\n                if white <= remaining_planned:\n                    remaining_planned -= white\n                    C.remove(white)  # Remove the used white button\n            \n            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks\n            for black in D:\n                if remaining_planned <= 0:\n                    break\n                if B[i] + black <= A[i]:  # Ensure we don't exceed planned tasks\n                    B[i] += black  # Increase completed tasks\n                    D.remove(black)  # Remove the used black button\n            \n            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted\n            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)\n        \n        print(total_uncompleted)\n```\n\nThis experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing state and conditions in problems involving resource allocation and constraints. Future attempts should focus on a more systematic approach to button usage and task management.",
    "reflection": "### Reflection on the Problem-Solving Experience\n\nIn my attempts to solve the problem, I initially focused on using the white and black buttons in a straightforward manner, iterating through them to reduce planned tasks and increase completed tasks. However, my approach failed to account for the optimal usage of buttons across multiple days, leading to incorrect results in test cases. Specifically, I did not effectively manage the constraints of not exceeding planned tasks when using black buttons, nor did I prioritize the usage of buttons in a way that minimized uncompleted tasks.\n\nThe official solution provided a more structured approach. It first calculated the difference between planned and completed tasks for each day, which allowed for a clearer understanding of how many tasks remained uncompleted. The solution then combined the black and white button values into a single list, sorted it, and used a greedy approach to apply the largest available buttons to the remaining tasks. This method ensured that the most significant reductions in uncompleted tasks were achieved first, leading to a more optimal solution.\n\nKey insights from the official solution include:\n1. **Calculate Differences**: By calculating the difference between planned and completed tasks upfront, the problem becomes clearer.\n2. **Combine and Sort Buttons**: Merging the black and white button values into a single list and sorting them allows for efficient application of the largest values first.\n3. **Greedy Approach**: Using a greedy strategy to apply the largest available button values ensures that the most significant reductions in uncompleted tasks are made, which is crucial for minimizing the final count.\n\nOverall, the official solution's approach is more efficient and effective in addressing the problem's constraints, highlighting the importance of strategic planning in problem-solving.",
