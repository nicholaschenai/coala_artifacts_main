He also has access to buttons that can either reduce the number of planned tasks or increase the number of completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:\n   - For each day, calculate how many tasks are left after Chef completes his tasks.\n   - Use the black buttons to increase the number of completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.\n   - Use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.\n   - Keep track of the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n       for each test_case in test_cases:\n           read N, K, M\n           read planned_tasks A\n           read completed_tasks B\n           read white_buttons C\n           read black_buttons D\n           \n           sort C in descending order\n           sort D in descending order\n           \n           total_uncompleted = 0\n           \n           for i from 0 to N-1:\n               remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]\n               if remaining_planned > 0:\n                   use_white = min(remaining_planned, max(C)) if C is not empty\n                   remaining_planned -= use_white\n                   if remaining_planned > 0:\n                       use_black = min(remaining_planned, max(D)) if D is not empty\n                       remaining_planned -= use_black\n               total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)\n           \n           print total_uncompleted\n\n   read T\n   test_cases = []\n   for each test_case in range(T):\n       read N, K, M\n       read A\n       read B\n       read C\n       read D\n       test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))\n\n   min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]\n        A = case[3]\n        B = case[4]\n        C = case[5]\n        D = case[6]\n        \n        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order\n        C.sort(reverse=True)\n        D.sort(reverse=True)\n        \n        total_uncompleted = 0\n        \n        # Iterate through each day\n        for i in range(N):\n            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks\n            if remaining_planned > 0:\n                # Use the largest white button if possible\n                if C:\n                    use_white = min(remaining_planned, C[0])\n                    remaining_planned -= use_white\n                    C.pop(0)  # Remove the used white button\n                \n                # Use the largest black button if possible\n                if remaining_planned > 0 and D:\n                    use_black = min(remaining_planned, D[0])\n                    remaining_planned -= use_black\n                    D.pop(0)  # Remove the used black button\n            \n            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted\n            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)\n        \n        print(total_uncompleted)\n\n# Read input\nT = int(input())\ntest_cases = []\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N, K, M = map(int, input().split())\n    A = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    B = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    C = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    D = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))\n\nmin_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)\n```",
