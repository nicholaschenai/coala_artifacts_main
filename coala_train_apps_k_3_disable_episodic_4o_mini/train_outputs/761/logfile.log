## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   Chef has a number of days where he has planned tasks to complete, but he has only managed to finish a certain number of those tasks. He has access to a Time Machine with buttons that can either reduce the number of planned tasks or increase the number of completed tasks. The goal is to minimize the total number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over the given days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   For each day, we need to determine how many tasks Chef can complete using the buttons. We will:
   - Use black buttons to increase the number of completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
   - Use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible without going below zero.
   - After processing all days, we will calculate the total uncompleted tasks by subtracting the completed tasks from the planned tasks for each day.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function minimize_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, M

           for each day from 0 to N-1:
               use black buttons to increase completed tasks
               for each button in D:
                   if B[day] + button <= A[day]:
                       B[day] += button
                       mark button as used
                       break
               
               use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
               for each button in C:
                   if A[day] >= button:
                       A[day] -= button
                       mark button as used
                       break

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_contests(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.

    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to calculate the number of valid schedules for Chef's restaurant, where each schedule consists of dishes served over N days with specific constraints. The key requirements were that no two consecutive days could serve the same dish, and the first and last days must serve different dishes.

    Initially, I derived a formula based on combinatorial reasoning, which was incorrect. The correct formula should have been \(4 \times 3^{(N-1)}\) for \(N \geq 2\). This accounts for:
    - 4 choices for the first day.
    - 3 choices for each subsequent day, including the last day, which must be different from the first.

    The main errors in my attempts included:
    1. Miscalculating the total schedules by incorrectly treating the last day as a separate case.
    2. Failing to properly implement the formula in the code, leading to incorrect outputs.

    The final working code correctly implements the formula and uses an efficient power function to handle large exponents modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The key takeaway is the importance of carefully analyzing constraints and ensuring that all conditions are accurately reflected in the mathematical model used for calculations. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def power(base, exp, mod):
        result = 1
        while exp > 0:
            if exp % 2 == 1:
                result = (result * base) % mod
            base = (base * base) % mod
            exp //= 2
        return result

    def calculate_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return 12
        else:
            return (4 * power(3, N-1, MOD)) % MOD

    def main():
        T = int(input())
        for _ in range(T):
            N = int(input())
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            print(result)

    main()
    ``` 

    This experience highlighted the importance of validating mathematical models against problem constraints and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the derived formulas.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Chef has planned tasks for several days and has completed a certain number of them.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The code attempts to use the largest available white button first to reduce the planned tasks and then the largest black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - However, the logic for using the buttons is flawed. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that once a button is used, it cannot be reused, and it should also consider the order of button usage more carefully.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple buttons can be used across multiple days effectively. It should prioritize using buttons in a way that maximizes the reduction of uncompleted tasks across all days.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code only uses the largest button available for each day without considering the overall effect on the total uncompleted tasks.
   - It does not keep track of the remaining buttons correctly after each day, which can lead to suboptimal usage of buttons.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining planned tasks and completed tasks needs to be more robust to ensure that it adheres to the constraints of the problem.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the buttons**: Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
2. **Iterate through each day**: For each day, calculate the remaining planned tasks after completing the tasks.
3. **Use buttons optimally**:
   - First, try to use the largest white button that can reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, use the largest black button that can increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.
4. **Track the total uncompleted tasks**: After processing all days, sum up the remaining planned tasks to get the total uncompleted tasks.

### Updated Code:
```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]
        A = case[3]
        B = case[4]
        C = case[5]
        D = case[6]
        
        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted = 0
        
        # Iterate through each day
        for i in range(N):
            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks
            
            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
            while remaining_planned > 0 and C:
                use_white = min(remaining_planned, C[0])
                remaining_planned -= use_white
                C.pop(0)  # Remove the used white button
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            while remaining_planned > 0 and D:
                use_black = min(remaining_planned, D[0])
                remaining_planned -= use_black
                D.pop(0)  # Remove the used black button
            
            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted
            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)
        
        print(total_uncompleted)

# Read input
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N, K, M = map(int, input().split())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    C = list(map(int, input().split()))
    D = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))

min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
``` 

This revised code should now correctly minimize the total uncompleted tasks by using the buttons in a more optimal manner.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

   - For each day, calculate how many tasks are left after Chef completes his tasks.
   - Use the black buttons to increase the number of completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
   - Use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
   - Keep track of the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Chef has planned tasks for several days and has completed a certain number of them.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The code attempts to use the largest available white button first to reduce the planned tasks and then the largest black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - However, the logic for using the buttons is flawed. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that once a button is used, it cannot be reused, and it should also consider the order of button usage more carefully.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple buttons can be used across multiple days effectively. It should prioritize using buttons in a way that maximizes the reduction of uncompleted tasks across all days.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code only uses the largest button available for each day without considering the overall effect on the total uncompleted tasks.
   - It does not keep track of the remaining buttons correctly after each day, which can lead to suboptimal usage of buttons.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining planned tasks and completed tasks needs to be more robust to ensure that it adheres to the constraints of the problem.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the buttons**: Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
2. **Iterate through each day**: For each day, calculate the remaining planned tasks after completing the tasks.
3. **Use buttons optimally**:
   - First, try to use the largest white button that can reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, use the largest black button that can increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.
4. **Track the total uncompleted tasks**: After processing all days, sum up the remaining planned tasks to get the total uncompleted tasks.

### Updated Code:
```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]
        A = case[3]
        B = case[4]
        C = case[5]
        D = case[6]
        
        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted = 0
        
        # Iterate through each day
        for i in range(N):
            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks
            
            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
            while remaining_planned > 0 and C:
                use_white = min(remaining_planned, C[0])
                remaining_planned -= use_white
                C.pop(0)  # Remove the used white button
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            while remaining_planned > 0 and D:
                use_black = min(remaining_planned, D[0])
                remaining_planned -= use_black
                D.pop(0)  # Remove the used black button
            
            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted
            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_contests(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.
[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.

    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.

    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.

    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Read number of boxes and capacity of each box
            ducks = case[2]  # Read the list of duck counts
            boxes = []  # This will hold the distribution of ducks in each box
        
            # Create a list of colors with their counts
            color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]
        
            # Fill each box
            for _ in range(N):
                m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box
                c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box
            
                # Try to fill the box with ducks
                for i in range(len(color_counts)):
                    if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full
                        if color_counts[i][1] > 0:  # If there are ducks of this color
                            if c1 == -1:  # First color

[/Summary]


[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.

    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly minimizes the total uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally. The key changes will involve ensuring that we properly utilize the available buttons across all days while adhering to the constraints.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]

        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted = 0
        
        # Iterate through each day
        for i in range(N):
            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks

                    remaining_planned -= white

            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted
            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)

min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Button Usage Logic**: The code now iterates through the sorted white and black buttons, applying them until the remaining planned tasks are reduced to zero or until all buttons are used.
2. **Condition Checks**: The conditions for using black buttons ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after applying the black button.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach is straightforward and ensures that we are using the buttons in a way that minimizes the uncompleted tasks effectively.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after processing all days and using the buttons optimally.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can only complete a certain number of them each day. He also has access to buttons that can either reduce the number of planned tasks or increase the number of completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each day, calculate how many tasks are left after Chef completes his tasks.
   - Use the black buttons to increase the number of completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
   - Use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
   - Keep track of the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Chef has planned tasks for several days and has completed a certain number of them.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The code attempts to use the largest available white button first to reduce the planned tasks and then the largest black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - However, the logic for using the buttons is flawed. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that once a button is used, it cannot be reused, and it should also consider the order of button usage more carefully.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple buttons can be used across multiple days effectively. It should prioritize using buttons in a way that maximizes the reduction of uncompleted tasks across all days.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code only uses the largest button available for each day without considering the overall effect on the total uncompleted tasks.
   - It does not keep track of the remaining buttons correctly after each day, which can lead to suboptimal usage of buttons.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining planned tasks and completed tasks needs to be more robust to ensure that it adheres to the constraints of the problem.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the buttons**: Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
2. **Iterate through each day**: For each day, calculate the remaining planned tasks after completing the tasks.
3. **Use buttons optimally**:
   - First, try to use the largest white button that can reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, use the largest black button that can increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.
4. **Track the total uncompleted tasks**: After processing all days, sum up the remaining planned tasks to get the total uncompleted tasks.

### Updated Code:
```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]
        A = case[3]
        B = case[4]
        C = case[5]
        D = case[6]
        
        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted = 0
        
        # Iterate through each day
        for i in range(N):
            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks
            
            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
            while remaining_planned > 0 and C:
                use_white = min(remaining_planned, C[0])
                remaining_planned -= use_white
                C.pop(0)  # Remove the used white button
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            while remaining_planned > 0 and D:
                use_black = min(remaining_planned, D[0])
                remaining_planned -= use_black
                D.pop(0)  # Remove the used black button
            
            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted
            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)
        
        print(total_uncompleted)

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly minimizes the total uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally. The key changes will involve ensuring that we properly utilize the available buttons across all days while adhering to the constraints.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]
        A = case[3]
        B = case[4]
        C = case[5]
        D = case[6]
        
        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted = 0
        
        # Iterate through each day
        for i in range(N):
            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks

                if remaining_planned <= 0:
                    break
                if white <= remaining_planned:
                    remaining_planned -= white
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            for black in D:
                if remaining_planned <= 0:
                    break
                if black <= remaining_planned + B[i]:  # Ensure we don't exceed planned tasks
                    remaining_planned -= black
            
            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted
            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)
        
        print(total_uncompleted)

# Read input

    D = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))

min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Button Usage Logic**: The code now iterates through the sorted white and black buttons, applying them until the remaining planned tasks are reduced to zero or until all buttons are used.
2. **Condition Checks**: The conditions for using black buttons ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after applying the black button.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach is straightforward and ensures that we are using the buttons in a way that minimizes the uncompleted tasks effectively.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after processing all days and using the buttons optimally.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can only complete a certain number of them each day. He also has access to buttons that can either reduce the number of planned tasks or increase the number of completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each day, calculate how many tasks are left after Chef completes his tasks.
   - Use the black buttons to increase the number of completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
   - Use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
   - Keep track of the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Chef has planned tasks for several days and has completed a certain number of them.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The code attempts to use the largest available white button first to reduce the planned tasks and then the largest black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - However, the logic for using the buttons is flawed. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that once a button is used, it cannot be reused, and it should also consider the order of button usage more carefully.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple buttons can be used across multiple days effectively. It should prioritize using buttons in a way that maximizes the reduction of uncompleted tasks across all days.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code only uses the largest button available for each day without considering the overall effect on the total uncompleted tasks.
   - It does not keep track of the remaining buttons correctly after each day, which can lead to suboptimal usage of buttons.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining planned tasks and completed tasks needs to be more robust to ensure that it adheres to the constraints of the problem.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the buttons**: Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
2. **Iterate through each day**: For each day, calculate the remaining planned tasks after completing the tasks.
3. **Use buttons optimally**:
   - First, try to use the largest white button that can reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, use the largest black button that can increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.
4. **Track the total uncompleted tasks**: After processing all days, sum up the remaining planned tasks to get the total uncompleted tasks.

### Updated Code:
```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly minimizes the total uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally. The key changes will involve ensuring that we properly utilize the available buttons across all days while adhering to the constraints.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

                    remaining_planned -= white
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            for black in D:
                if remaining_planned <= 0:
                    break
                if black <= remaining_planned + B[i]:  # Ensure we don't exceed planned tasks
                    remaining_planned -= black
            
            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Button Usage Logic**: The code now iterates through the sorted white and black buttons, applying them until the remaining planned tasks are reduced to zero or until all buttons are used.
2. **Condition Checks**: The conditions for using black buttons ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after applying the black button.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach is straightforward and ensures that we are using the buttons in a way that minimizes the uncompleted tasks effectively.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after processing all days and using the buttons optimally.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())

        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_contests(T, test_cases)

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.

    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.

    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.

    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):

            boxes = []  # This will hold the distribution of ducks in each box
        
            # Create a list of colors with their counts
            color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]
        
            # Fill each box
            for _ in range(N):
                m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box
                c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box
            
                # Try to fill the box with ducks
                for i in range(len(color_counts)):
                    if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full
                        if color_counts[i][1] > 0:  # If there are ducks of this color
                            if c1 == -1:  # First color

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if the final distribution of apples in boxes could differ based on which of two candidates was hired for the task. The first candidate distributes apples evenly across all boxes, while the second candidate fills the box with the least apples. The key insight was that if the number of boxes (K) equals the number of apples (N), the distributions would differ; otherwise, they would be the same.

    The solution involved checking if K equals N for each test case. If they are equal, the output is "YES"; otherwise, it is "NO". This approach is efficient given the constraints, as it only requires a simple comparison for each test case.

    The final implementation was straightforward and successfully handled the input and output as specified. The code effectively reads the number of test cases and processes each case in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(T), where T is the number of test cases. 

    Hereâ€™s the final code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case
            if K == N:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

        N, K = map(int, input().split())
        test_cases.append((N, K))

    can_distribute_apples(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem's constraints and the implications of the distribution methods. The solution was efficient and clear, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Button Usage Logic**: The code now iterates through the sorted white and black buttons, applying them until the remaining planned tasks are reduced to zero or until all buttons are used.
2. **Condition Checks**: The conditions for using black buttons ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after applying the black button.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach is straightforward and ensures that we are using the buttons in a way that minimizes the uncompleted tasks effectively.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after processing all days and using the buttons optimally.

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can only complete a certain number of them each day. He also has access to buttons that can either reduce the number of planned tasks or increase the number of completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each day, calculate how many tasks are left after Chef completes his tasks.
   - Use the black buttons to increase the number of completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
   - Use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
   - Keep track of the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Chef has planned tasks for several days and has completed a certain number of them.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The code attempts to use the largest available white button first to reduce the planned tasks and then the largest black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - However, the logic for using the buttons is flawed. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that once a button is used, it cannot be reused, and it should also consider the order of button usage more carefully.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple buttons can be used across multiple days effectively. It should prioritize using buttons in a way that maximizes the reduction of uncompleted tasks across all days.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code only uses the largest button available for each day without considering the overall effect on the total uncompleted tasks.
   - It does not keep track of the remaining buttons correctly after each day, which can lead to suboptimal usage of buttons.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining planned tasks and completed tasks needs to be more robust to ensure that it adheres to the constraints of the problem.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the buttons**: Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
2. **Iterate through each day**: For each day, calculate the remaining planned tasks after completing the tasks.
3. **Use buttons optimally**:
   - First, try to use the largest white button that can reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, use the largest black button that can increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.
4. **Track the total uncompleted tasks**: After processing all days, sum up the remaining planned tasks to get the total uncompleted tasks.

### Updated Code:
```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]
        A = case[3]
        B = case[4]
        C = case[5]
        D = case[6]
        
        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted = 0
        
        # Iterate through each day
        for i in range(N):
            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks
            
            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
            while remaining_planned > 0 and C:
                use_white = min(remaining_planned, C[0])
                remaining_planned -= use_white
                C.pop(0)  # Remove the used white button
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            while remaining_planned > 0 and D:
                use_black = min(remaining_planned, D[0])
                remaining_planned -= use_black
                D.pop(0)  # Remove the used black button
            
            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted
            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)
        
        print(total_uncompleted)

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly minimizes the total uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally. The key changes will involve ensuring that we properly utilize the available buttons across all days while adhering to the constraints.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]
        A = case[3]
        B = case[4]
        C = case[5]
        D = case[6]
        
        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted = 0
        
        # Iterate through each day
        for i in range(N):
            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks
            
            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
            for white in C:
                if remaining_planned <= 0:
                    break
                if white <= remaining_planned:
                    remaining_planned -= white
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            for black in D:
                if remaining_planned <= 0:
                    break
                if black <= remaining_planned + B[i]:  # Ensure we don't exceed planned tasks
                    remaining_planned -= black
            
            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted
            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)
        
        print(total_uncompleted)

# Read input
T = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(T):
    N, K, M = map(int, input().split())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    C = list(map(int, input().split()))
    D = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))

min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Button Usage Logic**: The code now iterates through the sorted white and black buttons, applying them until the remaining planned tasks are reduced to zero or until all buttons are used.
2. **Condition Checks**: The conditions for using black buttons ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after applying the black button.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach is straightforward and ensures that we are using the buttons in a way that minimizes the uncompleted tasks effectively.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after processing all days and using the buttons optimally.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem again step-by-step to identify the issues in the latest solution.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Chef has planned tasks for several days and has completed a certain number of them.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The previous code attempts to use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and the black buttons to increase the completed tasks, but it does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem.
   - Specifically, the logic for using the black buttons is flawed. The condition `if black <= remaining_planned + B[i]` does not ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after using the black button.
   - The code also does not handle the case where multiple buttons can be used across multiple days effectively. It should prioritize using buttons in a way that maximizes the reduction of uncompleted tasks across all days.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code does not keep track of the remaining buttons correctly after each day, which can lead to suboptimal usage of buttons.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining planned tasks and completed tasks needs to be more robust to ensure that it adheres to the constraints of the problem.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the buttons**: Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
2. **Iterate through each day**: For each day, calculate the remaining planned tasks after completing the tasks.
3. **Use buttons optimally**:
   - First, try to use the largest white button that can reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, use the largest black button that can increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.
4. **Track the total uncompleted tasks**: After processing all days, sum up the remaining planned tasks to get the total uncompleted tasks.

### Updated Code:

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can only complete a certain number of them each day. He also has access to buttons that can either reduce the number of planned tasks or increase the number of completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each day, calculate how many tasks are left after Chef completes his tasks.
   - Use the black buttons to increase the number of completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
   - Use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
   - Keep track of the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, M
           read planned_tasks A
           read completed_tasks B
           read white_buttons C
           read black_buttons D
           
           sort C in descending order
           sort D in descending order
           
           total_uncompleted = 0
           
           for i from 0 to N-1:
               remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Chef has planned tasks for several days and has completed a certain number of them.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The code attempts to use the largest available white button first to reduce the planned tasks and then the largest black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - However, the logic for using the buttons is flawed. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that once a button is used, it cannot be reused, and it should also consider the order of button usage more carefully.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple buttons can be used across multiple days effectively. It should prioritize using buttons in a way that maximizes the reduction of uncompleted tasks across all days.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code only uses the largest button available for each day without considering the overall effect on the total uncompleted tasks.
   - It does not keep track of the remaining buttons correctly after each day, which can lead to suboptimal usage of buttons.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining planned tasks and completed tasks needs to be more robust to ensure that it adheres to the constraints of the problem.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the buttons**: Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
2. **Iterate through each day**: For each day, calculate the remaining planned tasks after completing the tasks.
3. **Use buttons optimally**:
   - First, try to use the largest white button that can reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, use the largest black button that can increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.
4. **Track the total uncompleted tasks**: After processing all days, sum up the remaining planned tasks to get the total uncompleted tasks.

### Updated Code:
```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]
        A = case[3]
        B = case[4]
        C = case[5]
        D = case[6]
        
        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted = 0
        
        # Iterate through each day
        for i in range(N):
            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks
            
            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
            while remaining_planned > 0 and C:
                use_white = min(remaining_planned, C[0])
                remaining_planned -= use_white
                C.pop(0)  # Remove the used white button
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            while remaining_planned > 0 and D:

            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly minimizes the total uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally. The key changes will involve ensuring that we properly utilize the available buttons across all days while adhering to the constraints.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python

        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted = 0
        
        # Iterate through each day
        for i in range(N):
            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks
            
            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
            for white in C:
                if remaining_planned <= 0:
                    break
                if white <= remaining_planned:
                    remaining_planned -= white
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            for black in D:
                if remaining_planned <= 0:
                    break
                if black <= remaining_planned + B[i]:  # Ensure we don't exceed planned tasks
                    remaining_planned -= black
            
            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted
            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)
        
        print(total_uncompleted)

# Read input

    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))

min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Button Usage Logic**: The code now iterates through the sorted white and black buttons, applying them until the remaining planned tasks are reduced to zero or until all buttons are used.
2. **Condition Checks**: The conditions for using black buttons ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after applying the black button.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach is straightforward and ensures that we are using the buttons in a way that minimizes the uncompleted tasks effectively.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after processing all days and using the buttons optimally.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Button Usage Logic**: The code now iterates through the sorted white and black buttons, applying them until the remaining planned tasks are reduced to zero or until all buttons are used.
2. **Condition Checks**: The conditions for using black buttons ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after applying the black button.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach is straightforward and ensures that we are using the buttons in a way that minimizes the uncompleted tasks effectively.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after processing all days and using the buttons optimally.

[Summary]:
    In this task, I was required to help Chef determine the maximum number of Division-3 contests he could host based on the number of problems created by several setters. The key concepts involved were summing the total number of problems, calculating how many complete contests could be formed, and ensuring that the number of contests did not exceed the available days.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, processing each to compute the total problems, and then determining the maximum contests Chef could host by comparing the number of possible contests with the number of days available. The approach was straightforward and efficient, leveraging basic arithmetic operations and list summation.

    The final implementation successfully handled the input and output requirements, and the logic was validated against provided test cases. There were no unexpected errors, and the solution performed as expected, demonstrating a clear understanding of the problem's constraints and requirements. The code snippet used for the solution is as follows:

    ```python
    def max_contests(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K, D = case[0], case[1], case[2]
            A = case[3]
            total_problems = sum(A)
            contests_possible = total_problems // K
            max_contests = min(contests_possible, D)
            print(max_contests)

    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N, K, D = map(int, input().split())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, K, D, A))

    max_contests(T, test_cases)
    ``` 

    This experience reinforced the importance of breaking down the problem into manageable parts and ensuring that the solution adheres to the constraints provided.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to determine if a sequence of integers could be modified to have a sum of zero by decreasing each element \( A[i] \) by its index \( i \) (1-based). The key insights for solving the problem included:

    1. **Understanding the Total Sum**: The total sum of the sequence is crucial. If the sum is already zero, the answer is "YES". If the sum is negative, it's impossible to make it zero, so the answer is "NO". If the sum is positive, we need to check if it can be reduced to zero using the maximum possible reduction, which is the sum of the first \( N \) natural numbers.

    2. **Maximum Reduction Calculation**: The maximum reduction possible is calculated as \( N(N + 1)/2 \). This value represents the maximum amount we can decrease the total sum by using the allowed operations.

    3. **Condition Checks**: The final checks involve:
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is zero.
       - Returning "YES" if the total sum is positive and less than or equal to the maximum reduction.
       - Returning "NO" otherwise.

    The final working code is as follows:

    ```python
    def can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N = case[0]
            A = case[1]
        
            total_sum = sum(A)  # Calculate the total sum of the array
            max_reduction = N * (N + 1) // 2  # Calculate the maximum reduction possible
        
            if total_sum == 0:
                print("YES")
            elif total_sum > 0 and total_sum <= max_reduction:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read the number of test cases
    T = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        test_cases.append((N, A))

    can_make_good_sequence(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering edge cases and the implications of the operations allowed on the sequence. The initial misunderstanding of how to handle negative sums led to incorrect outputs, which were resolved by clarifying the conditions for returning "YES" or "NO".

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to distribute rubber ducks of various colors into boxes while adhering to specific constraints: each box can hold exactly `K` ducks and can contain at most two distinct colors. The challenge involved managing the counts of ducks effectively and ensuring the output format was correct.

    Initially, the approach to fill the boxes was flawed. The logic did not ensure that each box was filled to exactly `K` ducks, and it mishandled the counts of ducks remaining after filling each box. The output format was also not strictly followed, particularly when only one color was used.

    The successful strategy involved iterating through the available colors and filling each box while checking the remaining capacity. If a box could accommodate more ducks, the code would select colors accordingly and update their counts. If only one color was used, the second color's count was explicitly set to `0` to meet the output requirements.

    The final implementation effectively managed the duck counts and adhered to the output format, successfully passing all test cases. Key takeaways include the importance of careful count management and strict adherence to output specifications in programming challenges. 

    Here is the final working code snippet for reference:

    ```python
    def distribute_ducks(T, test_cases):
        for case in test_cases:
            N, K = case[0], case[1]  # Read number of boxes and capacity of each box
            ducks = case[2]  # Read the list of duck counts
            boxes = []  # This will hold the distribution of ducks in each box
        
            # Create a list of colors with their counts
            color_counts = [(i, ducks[i]) for i in range(len(ducks)) if ducks[i] > 0]
        
            # Fill each box
            for _ in range(N):
                m1, m2 = 0, 0  # Initialize counts for the box
                c1, c2 = -1, -1  # Initialize colors for the box
            
                # Try to fill the box with ducks
                for i in range(len(color_counts)):
                    if m1 + m2 < K:  # If the box is not full
                        if color_counts[i][1] > 0:  # If there are ducks of this color
                            if c1 == -1:  # First color
                                c1 = color_counts[i][0]
                                m1 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible
                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m1)  # Update count
                            elif c2 == -1:  # Second color
                                c2 = color_counts[i][0]
                                m2 = min(color_counts[i][1], K - m1 - m2)  # Fill as much as possible
                                color_counts[i] = (color_counts[i][0], color_counts[i][1] - m2)  # Update count
            
                # If we have only one color, ensure the other is set to 0
                if c2 == -1:
                    c2 = 0
                    m2 = 0
            
                # Append the box configuration
                boxes.append((c1, m1, c2, m2))
        
            # Output the boxes
            for box in boxes:
                print(box[0], box[1], box[2], box[3])

You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**:
   Chef has a number of tasks planned over several days, but he can only complete a certain number of them each day. He also has access to buttons that can either reduce the number of planned tasks or increase the number of completed tasks. The goal is to determine the minimum number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally over all days.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**:
   - For each day, calculate how many tasks are left after Chef completes his tasks.
   - Use the black buttons to increase the number of completed tasks as much as possible without exceeding the planned tasks.
   - Use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks as much as possible.
   - Keep track of the total uncompleted tasks after processing all days.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
       for each test_case in test_cases:
           read N, K, M

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Chef has planned tasks for several days and has completed a certain number of them.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The code attempts to use the largest available white button first to reduce the planned tasks and then the largest black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - However, the logic for using the buttons is flawed. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that once a button is used, it cannot be reused, and it should also consider the order of button usage more carefully.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple buttons can be used across multiple days effectively. It should prioritize using buttons in a way that maximizes the reduction of uncompleted tasks across all days.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code only uses the largest button available for each day without considering the overall effect on the total uncompleted tasks.
   - It does not keep track of the remaining buttons correctly after each day, which can lead to suboptimal usage of buttons.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining planned tasks and completed tasks needs to be more robust to ensure that it adheres to the constraints of the problem.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the buttons**: Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
2. **Iterate through each day**: For each day, calculate the remaining planned tasks after completing the tasks.
3. **Use buttons optimally**:
   - First, try to use the largest white button that can reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, use the largest black button that can increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.
4. **Track the total uncompleted tasks**: After processing all days, sum up the remaining planned tasks to get the total uncompleted tasks.

### Updated Code:
```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]
        A = case[3]

        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted = 0
        
        # Iterate through each day

            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
            while remaining_planned > 0 and C:
                use_white = min(remaining_planned, C[0])
                remaining_planned -= use_white
                C.pop(0)  # Remove the used white button
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks

            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted
            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly minimizes the total uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally. The key changes will involve ensuring that we properly utilize the available buttons across all days while adhering to the constraints.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python

                    remaining_planned -= white
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            for black in D:
                if remaining_planned <= 0:
                    break
                if black <= remaining_planned + B[i]:  # Ensure we don't exceed planned tasks
                    remaining_planned -= black
            
            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted

    test_cases.append((N, K, M, A, B, C, D))

min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Button Usage Logic**: The code now iterates through the sorted white and black buttons, applying them until the remaining planned tasks are reduced to zero or until all buttons are used.
2. **Condition Checks**: The conditions for using black buttons ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after applying the black button.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach is straightforward and ensures that we are using the buttons in a way that minimizes the uncompleted tasks effectively.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after processing all days and using the buttons optimally.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Button Usage Logic**: The code now iterates through the sorted white and black buttons, applying them until the remaining planned tasks are reduced to zero or until all buttons are used.
2. **Condition Checks**: The conditions for using black buttons ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after applying the black button.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach is straightforward and ensures that we are using the buttons in a way that minimizes the uncompleted tasks effectively.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after processing all days and using the buttons optimally.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the code step-by-step to identify the issues that are causing it to fail.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Chef has planned tasks for several days and has completed a certain number of them.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The previous code attempts to use the white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and the black buttons to increase the completed tasks, but it does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem.
   - Specifically, the logic for using the black buttons is flawed. The condition `if B[i] + black <= A[i]` does not ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after using the black button.
   - The code also does not handle the case where multiple buttons can be used across multiple days effectively. It should prioritize using buttons in a way that maximizes the reduction of uncompleted tasks across all days.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code does not keep track of the remaining buttons correctly after each day, which can lead to suboptimal usage of buttons.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining planned tasks and completed tasks needs to be more robust to ensure that it adheres to the constraints of the problem.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the buttons**: Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
2. **Iterate through each day**: For each day, calculate the remaining planned tasks after completing the tasks.
3. **Use buttons optimally**:
   - First, try to use the largest white button that can reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, use the largest black button that can increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.
4. **Track the total uncompleted tasks**: After processing all days, sum up the remaining planned tasks to get the total uncompleted tasks.

### Updated Code:

INFO - [Task id] 761 [generation text] In this problem, the goal was to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after Chef uses buttons that can either reduce planned tasks (white buttons) or increase completed tasks (black buttons). The challenge involved ensuring that the usage of these buttons adhered to the constraints of not exceeding planned tasks and managing the state of the buttons effectively.

Throughout the attempts, the main issues identified were related to the logic for using the buttons. The initial approach incorrectly handled the conditions for applying black buttons, leading to incorrect calculations of completed tasks. The code also failed to optimally utilize the buttons across multiple days, which resulted in suboptimal outcomes.

Key strategies that were attempted included sorting the buttons in descending order and iterating through them to apply the largest available button first. However, the logic for removing buttons from the list and ensuring that the total completed tasks did not exceed the planned tasks was flawed.

The final realization was that a more careful management of the remaining tasks and button states was necessary. The code needed to ensure that after each day, the remaining planned tasks were accurately calculated and that buttons were used in a way that maximized their effectiveness across all days.

The following code snippet represents the last attempt, which still did not yield the correct results:

```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:
        N, K, M = case[0], case[1], case[2]
        A = case[3]
        B = case[4]
        C = case[5]
        D = case[6]
        
        # Sort the white and black buttons in descending order
        C.sort(reverse=True)
        D.sort(reverse=True)
        
        total_uncompleted = 0
        
        # Iterate through each day
        for i in range(N):
            remaining_planned = A[i] - B[i]  # Calculate remaining planned tasks
            
            # Use white buttons to reduce planned tasks
            for white in C:
                if remaining_planned <= 0:
                    break
                if white <= remaining_planned:
                    remaining_planned -= white
                    C.remove(white)  # Remove the used white button
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            for black in D:
                if remaining_planned <= 0:
                    break
                if B[i] + black <= A[i]:  # Ensure we don't exceed planned tasks
                    B[i] += black  # Increase completed tasks
                    D.remove(black)  # Remove the used black button
            
            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted
            total_uncompleted += max(remaining_planned, 0)
        
        print(total_uncompleted)
```

This experience highlighted the importance of carefully managing state and conditions in problems involving resource allocation and constraints. Future attempts should focus on a more systematic approach to button usage and task management.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Chef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.
The good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! 
The Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.
Pressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.
Pressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.
Chef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?
Be careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!

-----Input-----
- The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains three integers â€” N, K, M â€” denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.
- The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, â€¦ , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.
- The third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, â€¦ , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.
- The fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, â€¦ , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.
- The fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, â€¦ , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.

-----Output-----
- In a single line, output an integer â€” the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.

-----Constraints-----
- 1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 4
- 1 â‰¤ N, K, M â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Bi â‰¤ Ai  â‰¤ 10^5
- 1 â‰¤ Ci, Di  â‰¤ 10^5

-----Subtasks-----
- Subtask N â‰¤ 10, K, M â‰¤ 5. Points: 30 
- Subtask Original constraints. Points: 70 

-----Example-----
Input:
1
4 2 2 
5 7 6 1
3 3 1 1
6 3
1 4

Output:
3

-----Explanation-----
Example case 1.
In this example Chef goes through the following steps:
Use black button 1 on the first day.
Use black button 4 on the second day.
Use white button 3 on the third day.
The arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:
5 7 3 1
4 7 1 1
So he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.

The output code needs to read from and write to standard IO

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Chef has planned tasks for several days and has completed a certain number of them.
   - He can use white buttons to reduce the planned tasks and black buttons to increase the completed tasks.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   - The code attempts to use the largest available white button first to reduce the planned tasks and then the largest black button to increase the completed tasks.
   - However, the logic for using the buttons is flawed. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that once a button is used, it cannot be reused, and it should also consider the order of button usage more carefully.
   - The code does not handle the case where multiple buttons can be used across multiple days effectively. It should prioritize using buttons in a way that maximizes the reduction of uncompleted tasks across all days.

3. **Where the Code Went Wrong**:
   - The code only uses the largest button available for each day without considering the overall effect on the total uncompleted tasks.
   - It does not keep track of the remaining buttons correctly after each day, which can lead to suboptimal usage of buttons.
   - The logic for calculating the remaining planned tasks and completed tasks needs to be more robust to ensure that it adheres to the constraints of the problem.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Sort the buttons**: Sort the white buttons in descending order and the black buttons in descending order.
2. **Iterate through each day**: For each day, calculate the remaining planned tasks after completing the tasks.
3. **Use buttons optimally**:
   - First, try to use the largest white button that can reduce the planned tasks.
   - Then, use the largest black button that can increase the completed tasks without exceeding the planned tasks.
4. **Track the total uncompleted tasks**: After processing all days, sum up the remaining planned tasks to get the total uncompleted tasks.

### Updated Code:
```python
def min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases):
    for case in test_cases:

                remaining_planned -= use_white

INFO - [Task id] 761 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly minimizes the total uncompleted tasks after using the buttons optimally. The key changes will involve ensuring that we properly utilize the available buttons across all days while adhering to the constraints.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

                if white <= remaining_planned:
                    remaining_planned -= white
            
            # Use black buttons to increase completed tasks
            for black in D:
                if remaining_planned <= 0:
                    break
                if black <= remaining_planned + B[i]:  # Ensure we don't exceed planned tasks
                    remaining_planned -= black
            
            # Add any remaining planned tasks to the total uncompleted

min_uncompleted_tasks(T, test_cases)

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Button Usage Logic**: The code now iterates through the sorted white and black buttons, applying them until the remaining planned tasks are reduced to zero or until all buttons are used.
2. **Condition Checks**: The conditions for using black buttons ensure that the total completed tasks do not exceed the planned tasks after applying the black button.
3. **Efficiency**: The approach is straightforward and ensures that we are using the buttons in a way that minimizes the uncompleted tasks effectively.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after processing all days and using the buttons optimally.

This code should now correctly compute the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks after processing all days and using the buttons optimally.

Below is the official solution (do exercise discretion as official solutions can also have mistakes).

You will be reflecting on your attempts to solve the problem.
This will be a **standalone** document for your own future reference. (can skip formalities, be concise)

## Instructions
- Only include the most relevant insights and code snippets that could be useful in the future.
- If you did not learn much from the current experience (e.g. the problem was too easy / official solution was obvious), feel free to write less or nothing at all.
- Here are some ideas if the experience was useful:
    - If the official solution is insightful (e.g. better than yours in time and space complexity or more effective in breaking down the problem statement), distil the key approach of the official solution, step by step.
    - If your approach failed the test cases, reason why the official solution works but yours does not

Your reflection should be at most a few paragraphs.

In my attempts to solve the problem, I initially focused on using the white and black buttons in a straightforward manner, iterating through them to reduce planned tasks and increase completed tasks. However, my approach failed to account for the optimal usage of buttons across multiple days, leading to incorrect results in test cases. Specifically, I did not effectively manage the constraints of not exceeding planned tasks when using black buttons, nor did I prioritize the usage of buttons in a way that minimized uncompleted tasks.

The official solution provided a more structured approach. It first calculated the difference between planned and completed tasks for each day, which allowed for a clearer understanding of how many tasks remained uncompleted. The solution then combined the black and white button values into a single list, sorted it, and used a greedy approach to apply the largest available buttons to the remaining tasks. This method ensured that the most significant reductions in uncompleted tasks were achieved first, leading to a more optimal solution.

Key insights from the official solution include:
1. **Calculate Differences**: By calculating the difference between planned and completed tasks upfront, the problem becomes clearer.
2. **Combine and Sort Buttons**: Merging the black and white button values into a single list and sorting them allows for efficient application of the largest values first.
3. **Greedy Approach**: Using a greedy strategy to apply the largest available button values ensures that the most significant reductions in uncompleted tasks are made, which is crucial for minimizing the final count.

Overall, the official solution's approach is more efficient and effective in addressing the problem's constraints, highlighting the importance of strategic planning in problem-solving.
