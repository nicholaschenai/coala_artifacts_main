[description for function: count_col_triang]
This function calculates the number of non-collinear triangles that can be formed from a set of points, categorized by their colors. It first organizes the points by color and then counts the triangles for each color by checking combinations of three points for collinearity. The function keeps track of the total number of triangles and identifies the color(s) with the maximum triangle count. Finally, it returns a summary that includes the total number of points, the number of unique colors, the total number of triangles, and a list of the color(s) with the maximum triangle count along with their respective counts. If no triangles can be formed, it returns a specific output indicating this. The function effectively combines geometric calculations with data organization to provide insights into the distribution of colored points.

This knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to analyze geometric properties of points in a plane, particularly in computational geometry, game development, or graphics programming. It can help in determining the relationships between points based on their colors, which can be applied in clustering algorithms, visual data representation, or even in solving problems related to triangulation in various fields such as computer graphics, robotics, and geographic information systems (GIS). Understanding how to count and categorize triangles formed by points can also be beneficial in mathematical modeling and simulations.
