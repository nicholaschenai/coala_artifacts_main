You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/66 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the count of positive numbers in that list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Initialize a counter to zero.
   - Iterate through each number in the list.
   - For each number, check if it is greater than zero.
   - If it is, increment the counter by one.
   - After checking all numbers, return the counter as the result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `pos_count` that takes a list `numbers` as input.
   - Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
   - For each `number` in `numbers`:
     - If `number` is greater than 0:
       - Increment `count` by 1.
   - Return `count`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def pos_count(numbers):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of positive numbers
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the current number is positive
        if number > 0:
            # Increment the counter if the number is positive
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of positive numbers
    return count
```

This function will correctly count and return the number of positive numbers in the given list.
