    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the count of positive numbers in that list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - Iterate through each number in the list.\n   - For each number, check if it is greater than zero.\n   - If it is, increment the counter by one.\n   - After checking all numbers, return the counter as the result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `pos_count` that takes a list `numbers` as input.\n   - Initialize a variable `count` to 0.\n   - For each `number` in `numbers`:\n     - If `number` is greater than 0:\n       - Increment `count` by 1.\n   - Return `count`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef pos_count(numbers):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of positive numbers\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is positive\n        if number > 0:\n            # Increment the counter if the number is positive\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of positive numbers\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count and return the number of positive numbers in the given list.",
