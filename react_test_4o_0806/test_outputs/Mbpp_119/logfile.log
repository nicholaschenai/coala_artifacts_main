You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/119 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a sorted array where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element that appears only once. Our task is to find and return this unique element.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Since the array is sorted, the elements that appear twice will be adjacent to each other.
2. We can iterate through the array in steps of 2, checking pairs of elements.
3. If a pair of elements are not equal, then the first element of that pair is the unique element.
4. If we reach the end of the array without finding a mismatch, the last element is the unique one.

## Pseudocode

```
function search(arr):
    for i from 0 to length of arr - 1, step by 2:
        if i is the last index or arr[i] is not equal to arr[i + 1]:
            return arr[i]
    return arr[length of arr - 1]
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def search(arr):
    # Iterate through the array in steps of 2
    for i in range(0, len(arr) - 1, 2):
        # If the current element is not equal to the next one, it is the unique element
        if arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:
            return arr[i]
    # If no unique element is found in the loop, the last element is unique
    return arr[-1]
```
