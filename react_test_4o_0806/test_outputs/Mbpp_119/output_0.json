    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe are given a sorted array where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element that appears only once. Our task is to find and return this unique element.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Since the array is sorted, the elements that appear twice will be adjacent to each other.\n2. We can iterate through the array in steps of 2, checking pairs of elements.\n3. If a pair of elements are not equal, then the first element of that pair is the unique element.\n4. If we reach the end of the array without finding a mismatch, the last element is the unique one.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction search(arr):\n    for i from 0 to length of arr - 1, step by 2:\n        if i is the last index or arr[i] is not equal to arr[i + 1]:\n            return arr[i]\n    return arr[length of arr - 1]\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef search(arr):\n    # Iterate through the array in steps of 2\n    for i in range(0, len(arr) - 1, 2):\n        # If the current element is not equal to the next one, it is the unique element\n        if arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:\n            return arr[i]\n    # If no unique element is found in the loop, the last element is unique\n    return arr[-1]\n```",
