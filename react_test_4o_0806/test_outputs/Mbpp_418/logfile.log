You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/418 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist that has the maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function should return the first one it encounters.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the sublist with the maximum length found so far.
2. Iterate through each sublist in the input list.
3. For each sublist, check its length.
4. If the current sublist's length is greater than the length of the sublist stored in the variable, update the variable to the current sublist.
5. After iterating through all sublists, return the sublist stored in the variable.

## Pseudocode

```
function Find_Max(list_of_lists):
    max_list = list_of_lists[0]  # Start with the first sublist as the maximum
    for each sublist in list_of_lists:
        if length of sublist > length of max_list:
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def Find_Max(list_of_lists):
    # Start with the first sublist as the maximum
    max_list = list_of_lists[0]
    
    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # If the current sublist's length is greater than the max_list's length, update max_list
        if len(sublist) > len(max_list):
            max_list = sublist
    
    # Return the sublist with the maximum length
    return max_list
```
