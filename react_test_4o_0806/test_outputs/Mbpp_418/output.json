    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a Python function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist that has the maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function should return the first one it encounters.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the sublist with the maximum length found so far.\n2. Iterate through each sublist in the input list.\n3. For each sublist, check its length.\n4. If the current sublist's length is greater than the length of the sublist stored in the variable, update the variable to the current sublist.\n5. After iterating through all sublists, return the sublist stored in the variable.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n    max_list = list_of_lists[0]  # Start with the first sublist as the maximum\n    for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n        if length of sublist > length of max_list:\n            max_list = sublist\n    return max_list\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n    # Start with the first sublist as the maximum\n    max_list = list_of_lists[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # If the current sublist's length is greater than the max_list's length, update max_list\n        if len(sublist) > len(max_list):\n            max_list = sublist\n    \n    # Return the sublist with the maximum length\n    return max_list\n```",
