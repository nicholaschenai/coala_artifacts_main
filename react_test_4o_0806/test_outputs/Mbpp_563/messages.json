        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the values that are enclosed within double quotation marks. The function should return these values as a list of strings.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate through the input string and look for double quotation marks.\n   - When we find an opening quotation mark, we will start collecting characters until we find the corresponding closing quotation mark.\n   - Once we find the closing quotation mark, we will store the collected characters as a string in a list.\n   - We will continue this process until we have processed the entire string.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of extracted strings.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function extract_values with parameter input_string\n       Initialize an empty list called results\n       Initialize a variable i to 0\n       While i is less than the length of input_string\n           If the character at index i is a double quote\n               Increment i to move past the opening quote\n               Initialize an empty string called value\n               While i is less than the length of input_string and character at index i is not a double quote\n                   Append character at index i to value\n                   Increment i\n               Append value to results\n           Increment i\n       Return results\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_values(input_string: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted values\n    results = []\n    # Initialize a counter to iterate through the string\n    i = 0\n    # Loop through the string\n    while i < len(input_string):\n        # Check if the current character is a double quote\n        if input_string[i] == '\"':\n            # Move to the next character after the opening quote\n            i += 1\n            # Initialize an empty string to collect the value\n            value = ''\n            # Collect characters until the next double quote is found\n            while i < len(input_string) and input_string[i] != '\"':\n                value += input_string[i]\n                i += 1\n            # Add the collected value to the results list\n            results.append(value)\n        # Move to the next character\n        i += 1\n    # Return the list of extracted values\n    return results\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the input string, identifies substrings enclosed in double quotes, and collects them into a list, which is then returned."
