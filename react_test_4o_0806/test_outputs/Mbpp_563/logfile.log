You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/563 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the values that are enclosed within double quotation marks. The function should return these values as a list of strings.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through the input string and look for double quotation marks.
   - When we find an opening quotation mark, we will start collecting characters until we find the corresponding closing quotation mark.
   - Once we find the closing quotation mark, we will store the collected characters as a string in a list.
   - We will continue this process until we have processed the entire string.
   - Finally, we will return the list of extracted strings.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function extract_values with parameter input_string
       Initialize an empty list called results
       Initialize a variable i to 0
       While i is less than the length of input_string
           If the character at index i is a double quote
               Increment i to move past the opening quote
               Initialize an empty string called value
               While i is less than the length of input_string and character at index i is not a double quote
                   Append character at index i to value
                   Increment i
               Append value to results
           Increment i
       Return results
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def extract_values(input_string: str) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted values
    results = []
    # Initialize a counter to iterate through the string
    i = 0
    # Loop through the string
    while i < len(input_string):
        # Check if the current character is a double quote
        if input_string[i] == '"':
            # Move to the next character after the opening quote
            i += 1
            # Initialize an empty string to collect the value
            value = ''
            # Collect characters until the next double quote is found
            while i < len(input_string) and input_string[i] != '"':
                value += input_string[i]
                i += 1
            # Add the collected value to the results list
            results.append(value)
        # Move to the next character
        i += 1
    # Return the list of extracted values
    return results
```

This solution iterates through the input string, identifies substrings enclosed in double quotes, and collects them into a list, which is then returned.
