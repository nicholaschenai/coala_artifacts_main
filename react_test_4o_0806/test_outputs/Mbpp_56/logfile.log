You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/56 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given integer is one less than twice the reverse of its digits. For example, if the number is 70, we reverse the digits to get 07 (or 7), then double it to get 14, and check if 70 is one less than 14. If it is, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Reverse the Digits**: Convert the number to a string, reverse the string, and convert it back to an integer.
2. **Double the Reversed Number**: Multiply the reversed number by 2.
3. **Check the Condition**: Verify if the original number is one less than the doubled reversed number.
4. **Return the Result**: Return `True` if the condition is met, otherwise return `False`.

### Pseudocode

```
function check(n):
    convert n to string and reverse it
    convert the reversed string back to an integer, call it reversed_number
    double the reversed_number
    if n is equal to (2 * reversed_number) - 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Python Code

```python
def check(n: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the number to a string and reverse it
    reversed_str = str(n)[::-1]
    # Convert the reversed string back to an integer
    reversed_number = int(reversed_str)
    # Double the reversed number
    doubled_reversed = 2 * reversed_number
    # Check if the original number is one less than the doubled reversed number
    return n == doubled_reversed - 1
```
