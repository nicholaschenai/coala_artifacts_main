        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if a given integer is one less than twice the reverse of its digits. For example, if the number is 70, we reverse the digits to get 07 (or 7), then double it to get 14, and check if 70 is one less than 14. If it is, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Reverse the Digits**: Convert the number to a string, reverse the string, and convert it back to an integer.\n2. **Double the Reversed Number**: Multiply the reversed number by 2.\n3. **Check the Condition**: Verify if the original number is one less than the doubled reversed number.\n4. **Return the Result**: Return `True` if the condition is met, otherwise return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction check(n):\n    convert n to string and reverse it\n    convert the reversed string back to an integer, call it reversed_number\n    double the reversed_number\n    if n is equal to (2 * reversed_number) - 1:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef check(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string and reverse it\n    reversed_str = str(n)[::-1]\n    # Convert the reversed string back to an integer\n    reversed_number = int(reversed_str)\n    # Double the reversed number\n    doubled_reversed = 2 * reversed_number\n    # Check if the original number is one less than the doubled reversed number\n    return n == doubled_reversed - 1\n```"
