You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/772 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a string and an integer `k` as inputs. The function should return a new string where all words of length `k` have been removed from the original string.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Split the input string into a list of words.
   - Iterate over this list and filter out words that have a length equal to `k`.
   - Join the remaining words back into a single string with spaces in between.
   - Return the resulting string.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function remove_length(s, k):
       split the string `s` into a list of words
       create an empty list `filtered_words`
       for each word in the list of words:
           if the length of the word is not equal to `k`:
               add the word to `filtered_words`
       join the `filtered_words` list into a string with spaces
       return the resulting string
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def remove_length(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    # Split the input string into a list of words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Filter out words that have a length equal to k
    filtered_words = [word for word in words if len(word) != k]
    
    # Join the filtered words back into a single string with spaces
    result = ' '.join(filtered_words)
    
    # Return the resulting string
    return result
```

This function will take a string and an integer `k`, remove all words of length `k` from the string, and return the modified string.

    # Join the filtered words back into a single string with spaces
    result = ' '.join(filtered_words)
    
    # Return the resulting string
    return result
```

This function will take a string and an integer `k`, remove all words of length `k` from the string, and return the modified string.
