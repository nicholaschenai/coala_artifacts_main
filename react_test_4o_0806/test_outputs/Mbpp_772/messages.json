The function should return a new string where all words of length `k` have been removed from the original string.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Split the input string into a list of words.\n   - Iterate over this list and filter out words that have a length equal to `k`.\n   - Join the remaining words back into a single string with spaces in between.\n   - Return the resulting string.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function remove_length(s, k):\n       split the string `s` into a list of words\n       create an empty list `filtered_words`\n       for each word in the list of words:\n           if the length of the word is not equal to `k`:\n               add the word to `filtered_words`\n       join the `filtered_words` list into a string with spaces\n       return the resulting string\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_length(s: str, k: int) -> str:\n    # Split the input string into a list of words\n    words = s.split()\n    \n    # Filter out words that have a length equal to k\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if len(word) != k]\n    \n    # Join the filtered words back into a single string with spaces\n    result = ' '.join(filtered_words)\n    \n    # Return the resulting string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take a string and an integer `k`, remove all words of length `k` from the string, and return the modified string."
