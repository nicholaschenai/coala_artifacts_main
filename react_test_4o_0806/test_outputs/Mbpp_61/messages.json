        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that counts the number of substrings in a given string of digits where the sum of the digits in each substring is equal to the length of that substring.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Iterate through all possible substrings**: We will generate all possible substrings of the input string. For a string of length `n`, there are `n(n+1)/2` possible substrings.\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of digits and length for each substring**: For each substring, calculate the sum of its digits and compare it to the length of the substring.\n\n3. **Count valid substrings**: If the sum of the digits equals the length of the substring, increment a counter.\n\n4. **Return the count**: After checking all substrings, return the count of valid substrings.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_Substrings(s):\n    initialize count to 0\n    for each starting index i from 0 to length of s - 1:\n        initialize sum_of_digits to 0\n        for each ending index j from i to length of s - 1:\n            add integer value of s[j] to sum_of_digits\n            if sum_of_digits equals (j - i + 1):\n                increment count\n    return count\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_Substrings(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize the count of valid substrings\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible starting index of the substring\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Initialize the sum of digits for the current starting index\n        sum_of_digits = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each possible ending index of the substring\n        for j in range(i, len(s)):\n            # Add the current digit to the sum\n            sum_of_digits += int(s[j])\n            \n            # Calculate the length of the current substring\n            length_of_substring = j - i + 1\n            \n            # Check if the sum of digits equals the length of the substring\n            if sum_of_digits == length_of_substring:\n                # Increment the count if the condition is met\n                count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of valid substrings\n    return count\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through all possible substrings, calculates the sum of digits for each, and checks if it matches the length of the substring. It efficiently counts and returns the number of valid substrings."
