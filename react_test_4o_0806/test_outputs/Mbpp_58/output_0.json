    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that takes two integers as input and checks if they have opposite signs. If one integer is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To determine if two integers have opposite signs, we can use the property of multiplication. If two numbers have opposite signs, their product will be negative. Therefore, we can multiply the two integers and check if the result is less than zero. If it is, the integers have opposite signs.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `opposite_Signs` that takes two integers `a` and `b`.\n   - Multiply `a` and `b`.\n   - Check if the result of the multiplication is less than zero.\n   - If it is, return `True` (indicating opposite signs).\n   - Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef opposite_Signs(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n    # Multiply the two integers\n    product = a * b\n    \n    # Check if the product is less than zero\n    # If it is, the integers have opposite signs\n    return product < 0\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if the two given integers have opposite signs by checking if their product is negative.",
