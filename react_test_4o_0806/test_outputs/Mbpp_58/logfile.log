You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/58 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes two integers as input and checks if they have opposite signs. If one integer is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To determine if two integers have opposite signs, we can use the property of multiplication. If two numbers have opposite signs, their product will be negative. Therefore, we can multiply the two integers and check if the result is less than zero. If it is, the integers have opposite signs.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `opposite_Signs` that takes two integers `a` and `b`.
   - Multiply `a` and `b`.
   - Check if the result of the multiplication is less than zero.
   - If it is, return `True` (indicating opposite signs).
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def opposite_Signs(a: int, b: int) -> bool:
    # Multiply the two integers
    product = a * b
    
    # Check if the product is less than zero
    # If it is, the integers have opposite signs
    return product < 0
```

This function will correctly determine if the two given integers have opposite signs by checking if their product is negative.
