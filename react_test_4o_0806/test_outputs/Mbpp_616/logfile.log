You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/616 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes two tuples of the same length and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain the result of performing the modulo operation on corresponding elements from the two input tuples.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input**: Two tuples of the same length.
2. **Output**: A new tuple where each element is the result of the modulo operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples.
3. **Process**:
   - Iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements, compute the modulo of the first element by the second element.
   - Collect these results into a new tuple.
   - Return the new tuple.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `tuple_modulo` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
2. Initialize an empty list `result`.
3. Loop over the indices of the tuples:
   - Compute the modulo of the element at the current index in `tuple1` by the element at the same index in `tuple2`.
   - Append the result to the `result` list.
4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple.
5. Return the resulting tuple.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def tuple_modulo(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the modulo operations
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Compute the modulo of the elements at the current index
        mod_result = tuple1[i] % tuple2[i]
        # Append the result to the list
        result.append(mod_result)
    
    # Convert the list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
