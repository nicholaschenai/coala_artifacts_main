This new tuple should contain the result of performing the modulo operation on corresponding elements from the two input tuples.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input**: Two tuples of the same length.\n2. **Output**: A new tuple where each element is the result of the modulo operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples.\n3. **Process**:\n   - Iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of elements, compute the modulo of the first element by the second element.\n   - Collect these results into a new tuple.\n   - Return the new tuple.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `tuple_modulo` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.\n2. Initialize an empty list `result`.\n3. Loop over the indices of the tuples:\n   - Compute the modulo of the element at the current index in `tuple1` by the element at the same index in `tuple2`.\n   - Append the result to the `result` list.\n4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple.\n5. Return the resulting tuple.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef tuple_modulo(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the modulo operations\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Compute the modulo of the elements at the current index\n        mod_result = tuple1[i] % tuple2[i]\n        # Append the result to the list\n        result.append(mod_result)\n    \n    # Convert the list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```"
