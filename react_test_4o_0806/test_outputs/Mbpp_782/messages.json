        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all subarrays that have an odd length. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Iterate over all possible subarrays of the input list.\n   - Check if the length of each subarray is odd.\n   - If it is odd, calculate the sum of the elements in that subarray and add it to a running total.\n   - Finally, return the total sum of all odd-length subarrays.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize total_sum to 0\n   For each starting index i from 0 to the length of the array - 1:\n       For each ending index j from i to the length of the array - 1:\n           If the length of the subarray from i to j is odd:\n               Calculate the sum of the subarray\n               Add the sum to total_sum\n   Return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_length_sum(arr):\n    # Initialize the total sum of odd-length subarrays\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible starting indices of subarrays\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Iterate over all possible ending indices of subarrays\n        for j in range(i, len(arr)):\n            # Check if the length of the subarray is odd\n            if (j - i + 1) % 2 == 1:\n                # Calculate the sum of the current subarray\n                subarray_sum = sum(arr[i:j+1])\n                # Add the subarray sum to the total sum\n                total_sum += subarray_sum\n    \n    # Return the total sum of all odd-length subarrays\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis code iterates over all possible subarrays, checks if their length is odd, and sums up their elements if they are. The final result is the sum of all such subarrays."
