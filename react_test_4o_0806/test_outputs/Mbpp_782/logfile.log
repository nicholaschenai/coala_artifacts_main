You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/782 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all subarrays that have an odd length. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Iterate over all possible subarrays of the input list.
   - Check if the length of each subarray is odd.
   - If it is odd, calculate the sum of the elements in that subarray and add it to a running total.
   - Finally, return the total sum of all odd-length subarrays.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize total_sum to 0
   For each starting index i from 0 to the length of the array - 1:
       For each ending index j from i to the length of the array - 1:
           If the length of the subarray from i to j is odd:
               Calculate the sum of the subarray
               Add the sum to total_sum
   Return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def odd_length_sum(arr):
    # Initialize the total sum of odd-length subarrays
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over all possible starting indices of subarrays
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Iterate over all possible ending indices of subarrays
        for j in range(i, len(arr)):
            # Check if the length of the subarray is odd
            if (j - i + 1) % 2 == 1:
                # Calculate the sum of the current subarray
                subarray_sum = sum(arr[i:j+1])
                # Add the subarray sum to the total sum
                total_sum += subarray_sum
    
    # Return the total sum of all odd-length subarrays
    return total_sum
```

This code iterates over all possible subarrays, checks if their length is odd, and sums up their elements if they are. The final result is the sum of all such subarrays.

                # Add the subarray sum to the total sum
