You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/268 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the nth star number. A star number is a figurate number that represents a centered hexagram (a six-pointed star), like the Star of David. The nth star number can be calculated using a specific formula.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The formula to find the nth star number is given by: `Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1`. This formula calculates the number of points in a star shape for a given n. We will implement this formula in a function to compute the nth star number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `find_star_num` that takes an integer `n` as input.
   - Use the formula `Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1` to calculate the nth star number.
   - Return the result.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**

```python
def find_star_num(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth star number using the formula
    # Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1
    star_number = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1
    # Return the calculated star number
    return star_number
```

This function will correctly compute the nth star number using the given formula.
