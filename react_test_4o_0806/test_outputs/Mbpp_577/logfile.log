## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the last digit of the factorial of a given number `n`. The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The task is to find the last digit of this product.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Factorials**: The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all integers from 1 to `n`. For example, `4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24`.

2. **Last Digit**: The last digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. For example, the last digit of 24 is 4 because `24 % 10 = 4`.

3. **Observations**:
   - For numbers `n >= 5`, the factorial will always end in 0 because the factorial will include both 2 and 5 as factors, which multiply to give 10.
   - For numbers `n < 5`, we can directly compute the factorial and then find the last digit.

4. **Plan**:
   - If `n` is less than 5, compute the factorial and return the last digit.
   - If `n` is 5 or greater, return 0 because the factorial will end in 0.

## Pseudocode

```
function last_Digit_Factorial(n):
    if n < 5:
        factorial = 1
        for i from 1 to n:
            factorial = factorial * i
        return factorial % 10
    else:
        return 0
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def last_Digit_Factorial(n: int) -> int:
    # If n is less than 5, calculate the factorial and return the last digit
    if n < 5:
        factorial = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            factorial *= i
        return factorial % 10
    else:
        # If n is 5 or greater, the factorial will end in 0
        return 0
```
