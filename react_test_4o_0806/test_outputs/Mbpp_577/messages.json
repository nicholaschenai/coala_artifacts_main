The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The task is to find the last digit of this product.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Factorials**: The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all integers from 1 to `n`. For example, `4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24`.\n\n2. **Last Digit**: The last digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. For example, the last digit of 24 is 4 because `24 % 10 = 4`.\n\n3. **Observations**:\n   - For numbers `n >= 5`, the factorial will always end in 0 because the factorial will include both 2 and 5 as factors, which multiply to give 10.\n   - For numbers `n < 5`, we can directly compute the factorial and then find the last digit.\n\n4. **Plan**:\n   - If `n` is less than 5, compute the factorial and return the last digit.\n   - If `n` is 5 or greater, return 0 because the factorial will end in 0.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n    if n < 5:\n        factorial = 1\n        for i from 1 to n:\n            factorial = factorial * i\n        return factorial % 10\n    else:\n        return 0\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is less than 5, calculate the factorial and return the last digit\n    if n < 5:\n        factorial = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            factorial *= i\n        return factorial % 10\n    else:\n        # If n is 5 or greater, the factorial will end in 0\n        return 0\n```"
