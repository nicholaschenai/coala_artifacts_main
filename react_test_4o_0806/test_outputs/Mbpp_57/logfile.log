You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find the largest number that can be formed with the given list of digits.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/57 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create the largest possible number by rearranging the digits in a given list. The digits are provided as integers in the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To form the largest number, we should arrange the digits in descending order. This means sorting the list of digits from the largest to the smallest. Once sorted, we can concatenate these digits to form the final number.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `find_Max_Num` that takes a list of integers `digits`.
   - Sort the list `digits` in descending order.
   - Convert each digit in the sorted list to a string.
   - Concatenate these string representations to form a single string.
   - Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.
   - Return the resulting integer.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_Max_Num(digits):
    # Step 1: Sort the digits in descending order
    sorted_digits = sorted(digits, reverse=True)
    
    # Step 2: Convert each digit to a string and concatenate them
    max_num_str = ''.join(str(digit) for digit in sorted_digits)
    
    # Step 3: Convert the concatenated string back to an integer
    max_num = int(max_num_str)
    
    # Step 4: Return the resulting integer
    return max_num
```

This function will take a list of digits, sort them in descending order, concatenate them into a string, convert that string to an integer, and return the largest possible number that can be formed from the given digits.
