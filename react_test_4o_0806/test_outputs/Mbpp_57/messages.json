The digits are provided as integers in the list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - To form the largest number, we should arrange the digits in descending order. This means sorting the list of digits from the largest to the smallest. Once sorted, we can concatenate these digits to form the final number.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `find_Max_Num` that takes a list of integers `digits`.\n   - Sort the list `digits` in descending order.\n   - Convert each digit in the sorted list to a string.\n   - Concatenate these string representations to form a single string.\n   - Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.\n   - Return the resulting integer.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_Max_Num(digits):\n    # Step 1: Sort the digits in descending order\n    sorted_digits = sorted(digits, reverse=True)\n    \n    # Step 2: Convert each digit to a string and concatenate them\n    max_num_str = ''.join(str(digit) for digit in sorted_digits)\n    \n    # Step 3: Convert the concatenated string back to an integer\n    max_num = int(max_num_str)\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the resulting integer\n    return max_num\n```\n\nThis function will take a list of digits, sort them in descending order, concatenate them into a string, convert that string to an integer, and return the largest possible number that can be formed from the given digits."
