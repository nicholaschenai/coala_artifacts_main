        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that searches for a specific substring (pattern) within a given string. The function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, its starting index, and its ending index in the original string.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Search for the Pattern**: We need to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string.\n2. **Determine Indices**: Once the pattern is found, determine the starting and ending indices of this pattern in the string.\n3. **Return the Result**: Return a tuple containing the found substring, the start index, and the end index.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `find_literals` that takes two parameters: `text` (the string to search) and `pattern` (the substring to find).\n2. Use the `find` method of the string to locate the starting index of the pattern in the text.\n3. If the pattern is found (i.e., the starting index is not -1):\n   - Calculate the ending index as the starting index plus the length of the pattern.\n   - Return a tuple containing the pattern, the starting index, and the ending index.\n4. If the pattern is not found, return a tuple with empty string and two -1s to indicate no match.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_literals(text: str, pattern: str) -> tuple:\n    # Find the starting index of the pattern in the text\n    start_index = text.find(pattern)\n    \n    # Check if the pattern is found\n    if start_index != -1:\n        # Calculate the end index\n        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)\n        # Return the pattern, start index, and end index\n        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)\n    \n    # If pattern is not found, return a tuple indicating no match\n    return (\"\", -1, -1)\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `find` method to locate the pattern in the text, calculates the indices, and returns the required tuple. If the pattern is not found, it returns a tuple with an empty string and indices set to -1."
