Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/607 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that searches for a specific substring (pattern) within a given string. The function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, its starting index, and its ending index in the original string.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Search for the Pattern**: We need to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string.
2. **Determine Indices**: Once the pattern is found, determine the starting and ending indices of this pattern in the string.
3. **Return the Result**: Return a tuple containing the found substring, the start index, and the end index.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `find_literals` that takes two parameters: `text` (the string to search) and `pattern` (the substring to find).
2. Use the `find` method of the string to locate the starting index of the pattern in the text.
3. If the pattern is found (i.e., the starting index is not -1):
   - Calculate the ending index as the starting index plus the length of the pattern.
   - Return a tuple containing the pattern, the starting index, and the ending index.
4. If the pattern is not found, return a tuple with empty string and two -1s to indicate no match.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_literals(text: str, pattern: str) -> tuple:
    # Find the starting index of the pattern in the text
    start_index = text.find(pattern)
    
    # Check if the pattern is found
    if start_index != -1:
        # Calculate the end index
        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)
        # Return the pattern, start index, and end index
        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)
    
    # If pattern is not found, return a tuple indicating no match
    return ("", -1, -1)
```

This solution uses the `find` method to locate the pattern in the text, calculates the indices, and returns the required tuple. If the pattern is not found, it returns a tuple with an empty string and indices set to -1.

    if start_index != -1:

    # Check if the pattern is found

        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)

        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)
    
    # If pattern is not found, return a tuple indicating no match
    return ("", -1, -1)
```

This solution uses the `find` method to locate the pattern in the text, calculates the indices, and returns the required tuple. If the pattern is not found, it returns a tuple with an empty string and indices set to -1.
