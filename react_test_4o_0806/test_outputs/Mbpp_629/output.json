    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function named `Split` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each number in the input list.\n   - For each number, we will check if it is even. A number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.\n   - If a number is even, we will add it to a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return this new list of even numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function Split with parameter numbers (a list of integers)\n       Initialize an empty list called even_numbers\n       For each number in numbers\n           If the number is even (number % 2 == 0)\n               Append the number to even_numbers\n       Return even_numbers\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Split(numbers):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store even numbers\n    even_numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If it is even, append it to the even_numbers list\n            even_numbers.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of even numbers\n    return even_numbers\n```\n",
