You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/787 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'a' followed immediately by exactly three 'b's. If the string contains this pattern, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and look for the pattern 'abbb'. We will check each character in the string to see if it is 'a', and if it is, we will check the next three characters to see if they are all 'b'. If we find such a pattern, we return `True`. If we reach the end of the string without finding the pattern, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function text_match_three with parameter text
       Loop through each character in text up to the length of text minus 3
           If the current character is 'a' and the next three characters are 'b'
               Return True
       Return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_match_three(text: str) -> bool:
    # Loop through each character in the string up to the length minus 3
    for i in range(len(text) - 3):
        # Check if the current character is 'a' and the next three are 'b'
        if text[i] == 'a' and text[i+1] == 'b' and text[i+2] == 'b' and text[i+3] == 'b':
            return True
    # If no such pattern is found, return False
    return False
