You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/734 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the sum of the products of all possible sublists of a given list of numbers. A sublist is any contiguous portion of the list, including the list itself and individual elements.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We need to consider all possible sublists of the given list.
   - For each sublist, calculate the product of its elements.
   - Sum up all these products to get the final result.

   To achieve this:
   - Iterate over all possible starting points of sublists.
   - For each starting point, iterate over all possible ending points to form sublists.
   - Calculate the product of each sublist and add it to a running total.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize total_sum to 0
   For each starting index i from 0 to length of list - 1:
       Initialize product to 1
       For each ending index j from i to length of list - 1:
           Multiply product by list[j]
           Add product to total_sum
   Return total_sum
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(lst):
    # Initialize the total sum of products to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each possible starting index of sublists
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        # Initialize the product for the current sublist starting at index i
        product = 1
        
        # Iterate over each possible ending index of sublists starting from i
        for j in range(i, len(lst)):
            # Multiply the current product by the element at index j
            product *= lst[j]
            
            # Add the current product to the total sum
            total_sum += product
    
    # Return the total sum of products of all sublists
    return total_sum
```

This code will correctly compute the sum of products of all possible sublists for a given list, as required by the problem statement.
