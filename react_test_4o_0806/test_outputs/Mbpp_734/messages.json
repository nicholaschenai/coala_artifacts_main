A sublist is any contiguous portion of the list, including the list itself and individual elements.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We need to consider all possible sublists of the given list.\n   - For each sublist, calculate the product of its elements.\n   - Sum up all these products to get the final result.\n\n   To achieve this:\n   - Iterate over all possible starting points of sublists.\n   - For each starting point, iterate over all possible ending points to form sublists.\n   - Calculate the product of each sublist and add it to a running total.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize total_sum to 0\n   For each starting index i from 0 to length of list - 1:\n       Initialize product to 1\n       For each ending index j from i to length of list - 1:\n           Multiply product by list[j]\n           Add product to total_sum\n   Return total_sum\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(lst):\n    # Initialize the total sum of products to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible starting index of sublists\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        # Initialize the product for the current sublist starting at index i\n        product = 1\n        \n        # Iterate over each possible ending index of sublists starting from i\n        for j in range(i, len(lst)):\n            # Multiply the current product by the element at index j\n            product *= lst[j]\n            \n            # Add the current product to the total sum\n            total_sum += product\n    \n    # Return the total sum of products of all sublists\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the sum of products of all possible sublists for a given list, as required by the problem statement."
