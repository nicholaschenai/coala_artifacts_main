    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a Python function that takes two inputs: a tuple and an element. The function should count how many times the given element appears in the tuple and return that count.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will define a function named `count_X` that takes two parameters: a tuple and an element.\n2. We will use the built-in method `count()` available for tuples to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple.\n3. The function will return the count of the element.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_X(input_tuple, element):\n    return input_tuple.count(element)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_X(input_tuple: tuple, element: int) -> int:\n    # Use the count method of tuple to find the number of occurrences of the element\n    return input_tuple.count(element)\n```",
