You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/250 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a Python function that takes two inputs: a tuple and an element. The function should count how many times the given element appears in the tuple and return that count.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will define a function named `count_X` that takes two parameters: a tuple and an element.
2. We will use the built-in method `count()` available for tuples to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple.
3. The function will return the count of the element.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_X(input_tuple, element):
    return input_tuple.count(element)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_X(input_tuple: tuple, element: int) -> int:
    # Use the count method of tuple to find the number of occurrences of the element
    return input_tuple.count(element)
```
INFO - program_code:

    # Use the count method of tuple to find the number of occurrences of the element
    return input_tuple.count(element)
