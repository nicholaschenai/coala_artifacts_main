A hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot at each vertex and along each side. The nth hexagonal number can be calculated using a specific formula.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   Hexagonal numbers can be calculated using the formula: \n   \\[\n   H_n = 2n^2 - n\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the position in the sequence. This formula gives us the nth hexagonal number directly. We will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer \\( n \\) as input and returns the nth hexagonal number.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `hexagonal_num` that takes an integer `n`.\n   - Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula: `2 * n * n - n`.\n   - Return the calculated hexagonal number.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef hexagonal_num(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula: 2n^2 - n\n    hexagonal_number = 2 * n * n - n\n    # Return the calculated hexagonal number\n    return hexagonal_number\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the nth hexagonal number using the given formula."
