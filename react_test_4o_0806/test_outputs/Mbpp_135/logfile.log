You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/135 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the nth hexagonal number. A hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot at each vertex and along each side. The nth hexagonal number can be calculated using a specific formula.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   Hexagonal numbers can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   H_n = 2n^2 - n
   \]
   where \( n \) is the position in the sequence. This formula gives us the nth hexagonal number directly. We will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer \( n \) as input and returns the nth hexagonal number.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `hexagonal_num` that takes an integer `n`.
   - Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula: `2 * n * n - n`.
   - Return the calculated hexagonal number.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def hexagonal_num(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula: 2n^2 - n
    hexagonal_number = 2 * n * n - n
    # Return the calculated hexagonal number
    return hexagonal_number
```

This function will correctly compute the nth hexagonal number using the given formula.
