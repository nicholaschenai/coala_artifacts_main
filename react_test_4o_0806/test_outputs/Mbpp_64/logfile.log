You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/64 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains a subject name and a corresponding mark. The function should return a new list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the second element (the mark) of each tuple.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities to sort the list of tuples.
2. The `sorted()` function can be used to sort the list, and we can specify a custom sorting key.
3. The custom key will be a function that extracts the second element of each tuple, which is the mark.
4. The `sorted()` function will then sort the tuples based on these extracted marks.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `subject_marks` that takes a list of tuples `marks_list` as input.
2. Use the `sorted()` function to sort `marks_list`.
   - Use a lambda function as the key to extract the second element of each tuple.
3. Return the sorted list.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def subject_marks(marks_list):
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple
    sorted_list = sorted(marks_list, key=lambda x: x[1])
    return sorted_list
```

This function will take a list of tuples, sort them by the second element of each tuple (the mark), and return the sorted list.
