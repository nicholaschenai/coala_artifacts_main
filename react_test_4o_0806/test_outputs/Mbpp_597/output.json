    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the k-th smallest element from two given sorted arrays. The arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order, and we are given a specific position `k`. The task is to determine the element that would be at the k-th position if both arrays were merged into a single sorted array.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Merge Concept**: Since both arrays are already sorted, we can use a merging technique similar to the one used in the merge step of the merge sort algorithm. This involves comparing the smallest unmerged elements of both arrays and adding the smaller one to the merged result.\n\n2. **Count Elements**: We don't need to merge the entire arrays. We only need to keep track of the number of elements added to the merged result until we reach the k-th element.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**: Consider cases where one of the arrays is exhausted before reaching the k-th element. In such cases, continue taking elements from the other array.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to zero. These will track the current index in each of the two arrays.\n2. Initialize a counter `count` to zero. This will track how many elements have been considered in the merged order.\n3. While `count` is less than `k`:\n   - If `i` is less than the length of the first array and either `j` is equal to the length of the second array or the element at `i` in the first array is less than or equal to the element at `j` in the second array:\n     - Increment `i`.\n     - Increment `count`.\n     - If `count` equals `k`, return the element at `i-1` in the first array.\n   - Otherwise:\n     - Increment `j`.\n     - Increment `count`.\n     - If `count` equals `k`, return the element at `j-1` in the second array.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):\n    # Initialize pointers for both arrays\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    # Initialize a counter to track the number of elements considered\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Loop until we find the k-th element\n    while count < k:\n        # If we have elements left in arr1 and either arr2 is exhausted or arr1[i] is smaller\n        if i < len(arr1) and (j >= len(arr2) or arr1[i] <= arr2[j]):\n            # Increment the count and move the pointer in arr1\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            # If we have reached the k-th element, return it\n            if count == k:\n                return arr1[i - 1]\n        else:\n            # Increment the count and move the pointer in arr2\n            count += 1\n            j += 1\n            # If we have reached the k-th element, return it\n            if count == k:\n                return arr2[j - 1]\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the k-th element by leveraging the sorted nature of the input arrays, ensuring that we only traverse as many elements as necessary to find the desired element.",
