INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/597 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the k-th smallest element from two given sorted arrays. The arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order, and we are given a specific position `k`. The task is to determine the element that would be at the k-th position if both arrays were merged into a single sorted array.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Merge Concept**: Since both arrays are already sorted, we can use a merging technique similar to the one used in the merge step of the merge sort algorithm. This involves comparing the smallest unmerged elements of both arrays and adding the smaller one to the merged result.

2. **Count Elements**: We don't need to merge the entire arrays. We only need to keep track of the number of elements added to the merged result until we reach the k-th element.

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider cases where one of the arrays is exhausted before reaching the k-th element. In such cases, continue taking elements from the other array.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to zero. These will track the current index in each of the two arrays.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to zero. This will track how many elements have been considered in the merged order.
3. While `count` is less than `k`:
   - If `i` is less than the length of the first array and either `j` is equal to the length of the second array or the element at `i` in the first array is less than or equal to the element at `j` in the second array:
     - Increment `i`.
     - Increment `count`.
     - If `count` equals `k`, return the element at `i-1` in the first array.
   - Otherwise:
     - Increment `j`.
     - Increment `count`.
     - If `count` equals `k`, return the element at `j-1` in the second array.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):
    # Initialize pointers for both arrays
    i, j = 0, 0
    # Initialize a counter to track the number of elements considered
    count = 0
    
    # Loop until we find the k-th element
    while count < k:
        # If we have elements left in arr1 and either arr2 is exhausted or arr1[i] is smaller
        if i < len(arr1) and (j >= len(arr2) or arr1[i] <= arr2[j]):
            # Increment the count and move the pointer in arr1
            count += 1
            i += 1
            # If we have reached the k-th element, return it
            if count == k:
                return arr1[i - 1]
        else:
            # Increment the count and move the pointer in arr2
            count += 1
            j += 1
            # If we have reached the k-th element, return it
            if count == k:
                return arr2[j - 1]
```

This solution efficiently finds the k-th element by leveraging the sorted nature of the input arrays, ensuring that we only traverse as many elements as necessary to find the desired element.
