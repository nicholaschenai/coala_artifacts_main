You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/80 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the nth tetrahedral number. A tetrahedral number is a figurate number that represents a pyramid with a triangular base and three sides (a tetrahedron). The nth tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The nth tetrahedral number can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     T(n) = \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (n + 2)}{6}
     \]
   - This formula comes from the fact that the nth tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers, and each triangular number can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first k natural numbers.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `tetrahedral_number(n)`.
   - Calculate the nth tetrahedral number using the formula: 
     \[
     T(n) = \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (n + 2)}{6}
     \]
   - Return the calculated value.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def tetrahedral_number(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth tetrahedral number using the formula:
    # T(n) = n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 6
    # This formula gives the sum of the first n triangular numbers.
    return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6
```

This function calculates the nth tetrahedral number using the derived formula, which efficiently computes the result in constant time.
