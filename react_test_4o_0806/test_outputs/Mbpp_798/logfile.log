You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/798 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of those numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and keep a running total of the sum. We start with a sum of zero and add each number in the list to this sum. Finally, we return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function _sum that takes a list of numbers as input
       Initialize a variable total to 0
       For each number in the list
           Add the number to total
       Return total
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def _sum(arr):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total = 0
    # Iterate over each number in the array
    for num in arr:
        # Add the current number to the total sum
        total += num
    # Return the total sum
    return total
```
