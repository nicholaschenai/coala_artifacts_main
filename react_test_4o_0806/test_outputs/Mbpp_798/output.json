    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of those numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and keep a running total of the sum. We start with a sum of zero and add each number in the list to this sum. Finally, we return the total sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define a function _sum that takes a list of numbers as input\n       Initialize a variable total to 0\n       For each number in the list\n           Add the number to total\n       Return total\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef _sum(arr):\n    # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    total = 0\n    # Iterate over each number in the array\n    for num in arr:\n        # Add the current number to the total sum\n        total += num\n    # Return the total sum\n    return total\n```\n",
