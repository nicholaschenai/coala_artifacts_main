    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple. The tuple should contain the second number first and the first number second.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The function will accept two parameters, which are numbers.\n   - We will create a tuple where the first element is the second parameter and the second element is the first parameter.\n   - Finally, we will return this tuple.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `swap_numbers` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n   - Inside the function, create a tuple with the elements in the order `(b, a)`.\n   - Return the created tuple.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef swap_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> tuple:\n    # Create a tuple with the second number first and the first number second\n    result = (b, a)\n    # Return the tuple\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take two integers as input and return a tuple with the second integer first and the first integer second, as required by the problem statement.",
