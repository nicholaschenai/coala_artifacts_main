You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/257 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple. The tuple should contain the second number first and the first number second.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The function will accept two parameters, which are numbers.
   - We will create a tuple where the first element is the second parameter and the second element is the first parameter.
   - Finally, we will return this tuple.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `swap_numbers` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
   - Inside the function, create a tuple with the elements in the order `(b, a)`.
   - Return the created tuple.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def swap_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> tuple:
    # Create a tuple with the second number first and the first number second
    result = (b, a)
    # Return the tuple
    return result
```

This function will take two integers as input and return a tuple with the second integer first and the first integer second, as required by the problem statement.

def swap_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> tuple:
    # Create a tuple with the second number first and the first number second
    result = (b, a)
    # Return the tuple
    return result
