    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that finds all perfect squares between two given numbers, inclusive. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 are perfect squares because they are 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, and 5^2, respectively.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Range**: We are given two numbers, `start` and `end`. We need to find all perfect squares between these two numbers, inclusive.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to `start` and continue until the square of the integer is less than or equal to `end`.\n3. **Collect Perfect Squares**: For each integer in this range, calculate its square and add it to the list of perfect squares if it falls within the range `[start, end]`.\n4. **Return the List**: Return the list of perfect squares found.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction perfect_squares(start, end):\n    initialize an empty list called squares\n    initialize i to 1\n    while i * i is less than or equal to end:\n        if i * i is greater than or equal to start:\n            add i * i to squares\n        increment i by 1\n    return squares\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef perfect_squares(start: int, end: int) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store perfect squares\n    squares = []\n    \n    # Start with the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to start\n    i = 1\n    \n    # Continue while the square of i is within the range\n    while i * i <= end:\n        # Check if the square of i is within the range [start, end]\n        if i * i >= start:\n            # Add the square to the list\n            squares.append(i * i)\n        # Move to the next integer\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Return the list of perfect squares\n    return squares\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over integers starting from 1, checking if their squares fall within the specified range, and collects those that do. The loop stops when the square of the integer exceeds the `end` value.",
