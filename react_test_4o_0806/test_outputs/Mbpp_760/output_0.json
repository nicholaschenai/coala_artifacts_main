    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to determine if all the elements in a given list of numbers are the same. If they are, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - To check if all elements in a list are the same, we can convert the list into a set. A set automatically removes duplicate elements. If the resulting set has only one element, it means all elements in the list were identical. Therefore, we can return `True`. If the set has more than one element, it means there were different elements in the list, and we should return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Convert the list to a set.\n   - Check the length of the set.\n   - If the length of the set is 1, return `True`.\n   - Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef unique_Element(numbers: list) -> bool:\n    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates\n    unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n    \n    # Check if the length of the set is 1\n    return len(unique_numbers) == 1\n```\n\n- **Explanation of the code:**\n  - We use the `set()` function to convert the list `numbers` into a set `unique_numbers`. This removes any duplicate values.\n  - We then check the length of `unique_numbers`. If it is 1, it means all elements in the original list were the same, so we return `True`.\n  - If the length is not 1, it means there were different elements in the list, so we return `False`.",
