You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/760 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to determine if all the elements in a given list of numbers are the same. If they are, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To check if all elements in a list are the same, we can convert the list into a set. A set automatically removes duplicate elements. If the resulting set has only one element, it means all elements in the list were identical. Therefore, we can return `True`. If the set has more than one element, it means there were different elements in the list, and we should return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Convert the list to a set.
   - Check the length of the set.
   - If the length of the set is 1, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def unique_Element(numbers: list) -> bool:
    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_numbers = set(numbers)
    
    # Check if the length of the set is 1
    return len(unique_numbers) == 1
```

- **Explanation of the code:**
  - We use the `set()` function to convert the list `numbers` into a set `unique_numbers`. This removes any duplicate values.
  - We then check the length of `unique_numbers`. If it is 1, it means all elements in the original list were the same, so we return `True`.
  - If the length is not 1, it means there were different elements in the list, so we return `False`.
INFO - program_code:
 
def unique_Element(numbers: list) -> bool:
    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_numbers = set(numbers)
    
    # Check if the length of the set is 1
    return len(unique_numbers) == 1
