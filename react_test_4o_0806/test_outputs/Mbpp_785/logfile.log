You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/785 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a string representation of a tuple containing integers and converts it into an actual tuple of integers.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - The input is a string that looks like a tuple, for example, "(7, 8, 9)".
   - We need to remove the parentheses and split the string by commas to get individual string numbers.
   - Convert these string numbers into integers.
   - Finally, return these integers as a tuple.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   - Define a function `tuple_str_int` that takes a string `s`.
   - Remove the parentheses from the string `s`.
   - Split the resulting string by commas to get a list of string numbers.
   - Convert each string number in the list to an integer.
   - Return the integers as a tuple.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**

```python
def tuple_str_int(s: str) -> tuple:
    # Remove the parentheses from the string
    s = s.strip("()")
    
    # Split the string by commas to get a list of string numbers
    str_numbers = s.split(", ")
    
    # Convert each string number to an integer
    int_numbers = tuple(int(num) for num in str_numbers)
    
    # Return the tuple of integers
    return int_numbers
```

This function will take a string like "(7, 8, 9)", remove the parentheses, split the string by commas, convert each part to an integer, and return the result as a tuple of integers.

    str_numbers = s.split(", ")
    
    # Convert each string number to an integer
    int_numbers = tuple(int(num) for num in str_numbers)
    
    # Return the tuple of integers

    # Return the tuple of integers
