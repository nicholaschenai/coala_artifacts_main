You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/108 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes three lists of integers as input and returns a single list that contains all the integers from the three lists, sorted in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, combine all three input lists into a single list.
   - Then, sort this combined list in ascending order.
   - Finally, return the sorted list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function merge_sorted_list that takes three lists as input: list1, list2, list3.
   Combine list1, list2, and list3 into a single list called combined_list.
   Sort combined_list in ascending order.
   Return the sorted combined_list.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):
    # Combine all three lists into one
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    
    # Sort the combined list in ascending order
    combined_list.sort()
    
    # Return the sorted list
    return combined_list
```

This solution efficiently merges and sorts the three input lists using Python's built-in list operations. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the lists, and the `sort()` method is used to sort the combined list in place.
INFO - program_code:
 
def merge_sorted_list(list1, list2, list3):

    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3

    combined_list.sort()
    
    # Return the sorted list
    return combined_list
