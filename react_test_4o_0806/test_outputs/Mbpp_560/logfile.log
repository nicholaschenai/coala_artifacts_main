You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/560 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple containing the union of the elements from both tuples, sorted in ascending order.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, combine the elements of both tuples into a single collection.
   - Remove any duplicate elements to ensure each element appears only once.
   - Sort the resulting collection of unique elements.
   - Convert the sorted collection back into a tuple and return it.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `union_elements` that takes two tuples as arguments.
   - Combine the elements of both tuples into a single list.
   - Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
   - Convert the set back to a list and sort it.
   - Convert the sorted list to a tuple.
   - Return the resulting tuple.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def union_elements(t1: tuple, t2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Combine both tuples into a single list
    combined_list = list(t1) + list(t2)
    
    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_elements = set(combined_list)
    
    # Convert the set back to a list and sort it
    sorted_list = sorted(unique_elements)
    
    # Convert the sorted list to a tuple
    result_tuple = tuple(sorted_list)
    
    # Return the resulting tuple
    return result_tuple
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and uses Python's built-in data structures and functions to achieve the desired result.
