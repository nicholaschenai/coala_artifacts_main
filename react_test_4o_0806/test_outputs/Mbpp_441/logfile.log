You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/441 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the surface area of a cube given the length of one of its sides.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - A cube has six faces, and each face is a square. The area of one face of the cube is the side length squared. Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is six times the area of one face. To find the surface area, we multiply the square of the side length by six.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `surfacearea_cube` that takes one parameter `side_length`.
   - Calculate the area of one face by squaring the `side_length`.
   - Multiply the area of one face by 6 to get the total surface area.
   - Return the total surface area.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def surfacearea_cube(side_length: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the area of one face of the cube
    face_area = side_length * side_length
    
    # Calculate the total surface area by multiplying the face area by 6
    total_surface_area = 6 * face_area
    
    # Return the total surface area
    return total_surface_area
```

This function will correctly compute the surface area of a cube given the side length, as demonstrated by the assertion `assert surfacearea_cube(5) == 150`.

    total_surface_area = 6 * face_area
    
    # Return the total surface area
    return total_surface_area
