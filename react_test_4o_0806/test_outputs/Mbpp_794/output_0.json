    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given string starts with the letter 'a', contains any characters in between, and ends with the letter 'b'.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Check if the first character of the string is 'a'.\n   - Check if the last character of the string is 'b'.\n   - Ensure that the string has at least two characters (since it needs to start with 'a' and end with 'b').\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named text_starta_endb that takes a string as input.\n   If the length of the string is less than 2, return False.\n   Check if the first character of the string is 'a' and the last character is 'b'.\n   If both conditions are true, return True.\n   Otherwise, return False.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef text_starta_endb(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string has at least two characters\n    if len(s) < 2:\n        return False\n    # Check if the string starts with 'a' and ends with 'b'\n    return s[0] == 'a' and s[-1] == 'b'\n```",
