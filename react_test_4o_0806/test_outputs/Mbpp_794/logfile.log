You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/794 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given string starts with the letter 'a', contains any characters in between, and ends with the letter 'b'.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Check if the first character of the string is 'a'.
   - Check if the last character of the string is 'b'.
   - Ensure that the string has at least two characters (since it needs to start with 'a' and end with 'b').

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function named text_starta_endb that takes a string as input.
   If the length of the string is less than 2, return False.
   Check if the first character of the string is 'a' and the last character is 'b'.
   If both conditions are true, return True.
   Otherwise, return False.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_starta_endb(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the string has at least two characters
    if len(s) < 2:
        return False
    # Check if the string starts with 'a' and ends with 'b'
    return s[0] == 'a' and s[-1] == 'b'
```
