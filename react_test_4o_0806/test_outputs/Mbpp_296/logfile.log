INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/296 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that counts the number of inversions in an array. An inversion is a pair of elements in the array such that the first element is greater than the second element, and the first element appears before the second element in the array.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To count inversions in an array, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The merge sort algorithm is efficient for this task because it divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and counts inversions during the merge step. The key idea is that when merging two sorted subarrays, if an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, then all remaining elements in the left subarray form inversions with this element.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
       i = left
       j = mid + 1
       k = left
       inv_count = 0

       while i <= mid and j <= right:
           if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
               temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
               i += 1
           else:
               temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
               inv_count += (mid - i + 1)
               j += 1
           k += 1

       while i <= mid:
           temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
           i += 1
           k += 1

       while j <= right:
           temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
           j += 1
           k += 1

       for i from left to right:
           arr[i] = temp_arr[i]

       return inv_count

   function merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
       inv_count = 0
       if left < right:
           mid = (left + right) // 2
           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)
           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)
           inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)
       return inv_count

   function get_Inv_Count(arr):
       n = length of arr
       temp_arr = array of size n
       return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, n - 1)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
    i = left    # Starting index for left subarray
    j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray
    k = left    # Starting index to be sorted
    inv_count = 0

    # Conditions are checked to ensure that i doesn't exceed mid and j doesn't exceed right
    while i <= mid and j <= right:
        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            # There are mid - i inversions, because all elements left to i in the left subarray
            # are greater than arr[j]
            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
            inv_count += (mid - i + 1)
            j += 1
        k += 1

    # Copy the remaining elements of left subarray, if any
    while i <= mid:
        temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1

    # Copy the remaining elements of right subarray, if any
    while j <= right:
        temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
        j += 1
        k += 1

    # Copy the sorted subarray into Original array
    for i in range(left, right + 1):
        arr[i] = temp_arr[i]

    return inv_count

def merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
    inv_count = 0
    if left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)
        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)
        inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)

    return inv_count

def get_Inv_Count(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    temp_arr = [0] * n
    return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, n - 1)
```

This solution uses a modified merge sort to efficiently count inversions in the array, achieving a time complexity of O(n log n).
