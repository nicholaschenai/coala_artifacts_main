        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts the number of inversions in an array. An inversion is a pair of elements in the array such that the first element is greater than the second element, and the first element appears before the second element in the array.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To count inversions in an array, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The merge sort algorithm is efficient for this task because it divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and counts inversions during the merge step. The key idea is that when merging two sorted subarrays, if an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, then all remaining elements in the left subarray form inversions with this element.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n       i = left\n       j = mid + 1\n       k = left\n       inv_count = 0\n\n       while i <= mid and j <= right:\n           if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n               temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n               i += 1\n           else:\n               temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n               inv_count += (mid - i + 1)\n               j += 1\n           k += 1\n\n       while i <= mid:\n           temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n           i += 1\n           k += 1\n\n       while j <= right:\n           temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n           j += 1\n           k += 1\n\n       for i from left to right:\n           arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n       return inv_count\n\n   function merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n       inv_count = 0\n       if left < right:\n           mid = (left + right) // 2\n           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n           inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n       return inv_count\n\n   function get_Inv_Count(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       temp_arr = array of size n\n       return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, n - 1)\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n    i = left    # Starting index for left subarray\n    j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray\n    k = left    # Starting index to be sorted\n    inv_count = 0\n\n    # Conditions are checked to ensure that i doesn't exceed mid and j doesn't exceed right\n    while i <= mid and j <= right:\n        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            # There are mid - i inversions, because all elements left to i in the left subarray\n            # are greater than arr[j]\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n            inv_count += (mid - i + 1)\n            j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the remaining elements of left subarray, if any\n    while i <= mid:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n        i += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the remaining elements of right subarray, if any\n    while j <= right:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n        j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the sorted subarray into Original array\n    for i in range(left, right + 1):\n        arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n    return inv_count\n\ndef merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n    inv_count = 0\n    if left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n        inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n\n    return inv_count\n\ndef get_Inv_Count(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    temp_arr = [0] * n\n    return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, n - 1)\n```\n\nThis solution uses a modified merge sort to efficiently count inversions in the array, achieving a time complexity of O(n log n)."
