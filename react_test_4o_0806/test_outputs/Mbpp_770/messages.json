        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we need to find the sum of the fourth powers of the first two odd numbers, which are 1 and 3.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, identify the first `n` odd natural numbers. Odd numbers start from 1 and increase by 2 each time (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...).\n   - For each of these odd numbers, calculate its fourth power.\n   - Sum all these fourth powers to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to keep track of the total sum.\n   - Loop through the first `n` odd numbers:\n     - Calculate the fourth power of the current odd number.\n     - Add this fourth power to `sum`.\n   - Return the value of `sum`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_num_sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n odd numbers\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Calculate the i-th odd number: 2*i + 1\n        odd_number = 2 * i + 1\n        \n        # Calculate the fourth power of the odd number\n        fourth_power = odd_number ** 4\n        \n        # Add the fourth power to the sum\n        sum += fourth_power\n    \n    # Return the total sum\n    return sum\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers."
