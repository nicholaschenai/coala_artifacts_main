You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/770 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we need to find the sum of the fourth powers of the first two odd numbers, which are 1 and 3.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, identify the first `n` odd natural numbers. Odd numbers start from 1 and increase by 2 each time (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...).
   - For each of these odd numbers, calculate its fourth power.
   - Sum all these fourth powers to get the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to keep track of the total sum.
   - Loop through the first `n` odd numbers:
     - Calculate the fourth power of the current odd number.
     - Add this fourth power to `sum`.
   - Return the value of `sum`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def odd_num_sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    
    # Loop through the first n odd numbers
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the i-th odd number: 2*i + 1
        odd_number = 2 * i + 1
        
        # Calculate the fourth power of the odd number
        fourth_power = odd_number ** 4
        
        # Add the fourth power to the sum
        sum += fourth_power
    
    # Return the total sum
    return sum
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers.
