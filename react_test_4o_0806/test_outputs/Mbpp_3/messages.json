If the number is not prime, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - To determine if a number is not prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - For numbers less than or equal to 1, they are not prime by definition.\n   - For numbers greater than 1, we can check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any number in this range divides the given number evenly, then it is not prime.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Function is_not_prime(n):\n       If n <= 1:\n           Return True (since numbers <= 1 are not prime)\n       If n == 2:\n           Return False (since 2 is the only even prime number)\n       If n is even:\n           Return True (since any even number greater than 2 is not prime)\n       For i from 3 to square root of n, incrementing by 2:\n           If n is divisible by i:\n               Return True (since n has a divisor other than 1 and itself)\n       Return False (since no divisors were found, n is prime)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_not_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime\n    if n <= 1:\n        return True\n    # 2 is the only even prime number\n    if n == 2:\n        return False\n    # Any other even number is not prime\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    # Check for factors from 3 to the square root of n\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return True\n        i += 2\n    # If no factors were found, n is prime\n    return False\n```"
