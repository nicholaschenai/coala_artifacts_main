You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/3 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that determines if a given integer is not a prime number. If the number is not prime, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - To determine if a number is not prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - For numbers less than or equal to 1, they are not prime by definition.
   - For numbers greater than 1, we can check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any number in this range divides the given number evenly, then it is not prime.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Function is_not_prime(n):
       If n <= 1:
           Return True (since numbers <= 1 are not prime)
       If n == 2:
           Return False (since 2 is the only even prime number)
       If n is even:
           Return True (since any even number greater than 2 is not prime)
       For i from 3 to square root of n, incrementing by 2:
           If n is divisible by i:
               Return True (since n has a divisor other than 1 and itself)
       Return False (since no divisors were found, n is prime)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def is_not_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    # Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime
