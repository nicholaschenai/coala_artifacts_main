You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/262 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer `L`. The function should split the list into two parts: the first part should have a length of `L`, and the second part should contain the remaining elements. The function should return these two parts as a tuple.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We can use list slicing to achieve this. The first part of the list can be obtained by slicing from the start of the list to the `L`-th index. The second part can be obtained by slicing from the `L`-th index to the end of the list. We then return these two slices as a tuple.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `split_two_parts` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`.
   - Slice the list from the start to `L` to get the first part.
   - Slice the list from `L` to the end to get the second part.
   - Return a tuple containing the first and second parts.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def split_two_parts(lst, L):
    # Slice the list from the start to L to get the first part
    first_part = lst[:L]
    # Slice the list from L to the end to get the second part
    second_part = lst[L:]
    # Return a tuple containing the first and second parts
    return (first_part, second_part)
```

This solution uses list slicing to efficiently split the list into two parts and returns them as a tuple. The slicing operation is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in capabilities to handle list operations.
