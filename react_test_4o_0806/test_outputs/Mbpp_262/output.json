    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer `L`. The function should split the list into two parts: the first part should have a length of `L`, and the second part should contain the remaining elements. The function should return these two parts as a tuple.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We can use list slicing to achieve this. The first part of the list can be obtained by slicing from the start of the list to the `L`-th index. The second part can be obtained by slicing from the `L`-th index to the end of the list. We then return these two slices as a tuple.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `split_two_parts` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`.\n   - Slice the list from the start to `L` to get the first part.\n   - Slice the list from `L` to the end to get the second part.\n   - Return a tuple containing the first and second parts.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef split_two_parts(lst, L):\n    # Slice the list from the start to L to get the first part\n    first_part = lst[:L]\n    # Slice the list from L to the end to get the second part\n    second_part = lst[L:]\n    # Return a tuple containing the first and second parts\n    return (first_part, second_part)\n```\n\nThis solution uses list slicing to efficiently split the list into two parts and returns them as a tuple. The slicing operation is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in capabilities to handle list operations.",
