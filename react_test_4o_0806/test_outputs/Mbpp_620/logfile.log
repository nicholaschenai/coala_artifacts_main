1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the size of the largest subset of a given list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in this subset is divisible by each other. In other words, for any two numbers `a` and `b` in the subset, either `a % b == 0` or `b % a == 0`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, sort the list of numbers. Sorting helps because if a number `a` is divisible by `b`, then `a` is usually greater than or equal to `b`.
   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the largest divisible subset ending at each element.
   - Initialize a list `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the element at index `i`.
   - For each element in the list, check all previous elements to see if they are divisible. If they are, update the `dp` value for the current element.
   - The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function largest_subset(nums):
       if nums is empty:
           return 0
       
       sort nums
       initialize dp array of size len(nums) with all 1s
       
       for i from 1 to len(nums) - 1:
           for j from 0 to i - 1:
               if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
       
       return max value in dp
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def largest_subset(nums):
    # If the list is empty, the largest subset size is 0
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the numbers to facilitate the divisibility check
    nums.sort()
    
    # Initialize the dp array where each element starts with a subset size of 1
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    
    # Iterate over each number in the sorted list
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        # Check all previous numbers to see if they divide the current number
        for j in range(i):
            # If nums[i] is divisible by nums[j], update the dp[i]
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    # The result is the maximum value in the dp array
    return max(dp)
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.
