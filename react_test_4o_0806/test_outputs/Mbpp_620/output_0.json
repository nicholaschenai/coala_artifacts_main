    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the size of the largest subset of a given list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in this subset is divisible by each other. In other words, for any two numbers `a` and `b` in the subset, either `a % b == 0` or `b % a == 0`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, sort the list of numbers. Sorting helps because if a number `a` is divisible by `b`, then `a` is usually greater than or equal to `b`.\n   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the largest divisible subset ending at each element.\n   - Initialize a list `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the element at index `i`.\n   - For each element in the list, check all previous elements to see if they are divisible. If they are, update the `dp` value for the current element.\n   - The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function largest_subset(nums):\n       if nums is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       sort nums\n       initialize dp array of size len(nums) with all 1s\n       \n       for i from 1 to len(nums) - 1:\n           for j from 0 to i - 1:\n               if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:\n                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n       \n       return max value in dp\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef largest_subset(nums):\n    # If the list is empty, the largest subset size is 0\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Sort the numbers to facilitate the divisibility check\n    nums.sort()\n    \n    # Initialize the dp array where each element starts with a subset size of 1\n    dp = [1] * len(nums)\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the sorted list\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        # Check all previous numbers to see if they divide the current number\n        for j in range(i):\n            # If nums[i] is divisible by nums[j], update the dp[i]\n            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n    \n    # The result is the maximum value in the dp array\n    return max(dp)\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.",
