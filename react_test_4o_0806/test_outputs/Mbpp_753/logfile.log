You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/753 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. Each tuple contains a name and a number. The function should return a list of `k` tuples with the smallest numbers, sorted in ascending order by the numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   - First, we need to sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple, which is the number.
   - After sorting, we can simply take the first `k` elements from this sorted list, as they will be the tuples with the smallest numbers.
   - Return these `k` tuples as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function min_k with parameters tuple_list and k
       Sort the tuple_list based on the second element of each tuple
       Slice the first k elements from the sorted list
       Return the sliced list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def min_k(tuple_list, k):
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple
    sorted_list = sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Return the first k elements from the sorted list
    return sorted_list[:k]
```

This function will correctly return the `k` tuples with the smallest numbers from the input list, sorted in ascending order by the numbers.

    # Return the first k elements from the sorted list
    return sorted_list[:k]
