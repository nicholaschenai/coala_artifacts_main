Each tuple contains a name and a number. The function should return a list of `k` tuples with the smallest numbers, sorted in ascending order by the numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple, which is the number.\n   - After sorting, we can simply take the first `k` elements from this sorted list, as they will be the tuples with the smallest numbers.\n   - Return these `k` tuples as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function min_k with parameters tuple_list and k\n       Sort the tuple_list based on the second element of each tuple\n       Slice the first k elements from the sorted list\n       Return the sliced list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef min_k(tuple_list, k):\n    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple\n    sorted_list = sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    \n    # Return the first k elements from the sorted list\n    return sorted_list[:k]\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the `k` tuples with the smallest numbers from the input list, sorted in ascending order by the numbers."
