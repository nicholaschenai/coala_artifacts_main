    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of integers and finds the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in the list. The function should return this difference as an integer.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the First Even Number**: Traverse the list from the beginning and find the first even number. An even number is any number that is divisible by 2 without a remainder.\n   \n2. **Identify the First Odd Number**: Continue traversing the list to find the first odd number. An odd number is any number that is not divisible by 2 without a remainder.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference**: Once both the first even and first odd numbers are identified, calculate the difference by subtracting the first odd number from the first even number.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated difference.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction diff_even_odd(numbers):\n    initialize first_even as None\n    initialize first_odd as None\n    \n    for each number in numbers:\n        if first_even is None and number is even:\n            set first_even to number\n        if first_odd is None and number is odd:\n            set first_odd to number\n        if both first_even and first_odd are not None:\n            break the loop\n    \n    return first_even - first_odd\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef diff_even_odd(numbers):\n    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers\n    first_even = None\n    first_odd = None\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even and first_even is not yet set\n        if first_even is None and number % 2 == 0:\n            first_even = number\n        # Check if the number is odd and first_odd is not yet set\n        if first_odd is None and number % 2 != 0:\n            first_odd = number\n        # If both first_even and first_odd are found, exit the loop\n        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # Return the difference between the first even and first odd numbers\n    return first_even - first_odd\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. The function will correctly return the difference between the first even and first odd numbers found in the list.",
