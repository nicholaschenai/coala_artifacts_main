Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and finds the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in the list. The function should return this difference as an integer.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the First Even Number**: Traverse the list from the beginning and find the first even number. An even number is any number that is divisible by 2 without a remainder.
   
2. **Identify the First Odd Number**: Continue traversing the list to find the first odd number. An odd number is any number that is not divisible by 2 without a remainder.

3. **Calculate the Difference**: Once both the first even and first odd numbers are identified, calculate the difference by subtracting the first odd number from the first even number.

4. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated difference.

### Pseudocode

```
function diff_even_odd(numbers):
    initialize first_even as None
    initialize first_odd as None
    
    for each number in numbers:
        if first_even is None and number is even:
            set first_even to number
        if first_odd is None and number is odd:
            set first_odd to number
        if both first_even and first_odd are not None:
            break the loop
    
    return first_even - first_odd
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def diff_even_odd(numbers):
    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers
    first_even = None
    first_odd = None
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is even and first_even is not yet set
        if first_even is None and number % 2 == 0:
            first_even = number
        # Check if the number is odd and first_odd is not yet set
        if first_odd is None and number % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = number
        # If both first_even and first_odd are found, exit the loop
        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:
            break
    
    # Return the difference between the first even and first odd numbers
    return first_even - first_odd
```

This solution iterates through the list once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. The function will correctly return the difference between the first even and first odd numbers found in the list.

    # Return the difference between the first even and first odd numbers
