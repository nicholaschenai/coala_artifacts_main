You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/744 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given tuple contains any `None` values. If there is at least one `None` value in the tuple, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate over each element in the tuple and check if any of them is `None`. If we find a `None` value, we immediately return `True`. If we finish checking all elements and find no `None` values, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function named check_none that takes a tuple as input.
   For each element in the tuple:
       If the element is None:
           Return True
   If no element is None, return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_none(t: tuple) -> bool:
    # Iterate over each element in the tuple
    for element in t:
        # Check if the current element is None
        if element is None:
            # If a None value is found, return True
            return True
    # If no None value is found, return False
    return False
```

This function will correctly identify if there is any `None` value in the given tuple and return the appropriate boolean value.

            # If a None value is found, return True
