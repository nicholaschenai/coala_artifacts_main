Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the number of '1's in its binary representation. This is often referred to as counting the \"set bits\" in the number.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can:\n- Convert the integer to its binary representation.\n- Count how many '1's are present in this binary string.\n\nPython provides a built-in function `bin()` that converts an integer to its binary representation as a string prefixed with '0b'. We can use this function and then count the '1's in the resulting string.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n1. Convert the integer to a binary string using `bin()`.\n2. Remove the '0b' prefix from the binary string.\n3. Count the number of '1's in the binary string.\n4. Return the count.\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # Convert the number to its binary representation\n    binary_representation = bin(n)\n    \n    # Count the number of '1's in the binary representation\n    # We use slicing [2:] to remove the '0b' prefix\n    count_of_ones = binary_representation[2:].count('1')\n    \n    # Return the count of '1's\n    return count_of_ones\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of set bits in the binary representation of the given integer."
