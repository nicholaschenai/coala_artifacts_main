You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/224 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the number of '1's in its binary representation. This is often referred to as counting the "set bits" in the number.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can:
- Convert the integer to its binary representation.
- Count how many '1's are present in this binary string.

Python provides a built-in function `bin()` that converts an integer to its binary representation as a string prefixed with '0b'. We can use this function and then count the '1's in the resulting string.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

1. Convert the integer to a binary string using `bin()`.
2. Remove the '0b' prefix from the binary string.
3. Count the number of '1's in the binary string.
4. Return the count.

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def count_Set_Bits(n: int) -> int:
    # Convert the number to its binary representation
    binary_representation = bin(n)
    
    # Count the number of '1's in the binary representation
    # We use slicing [2:] to remove the '0b' prefix
    count_of_ones = binary_representation[2:].count('1')
    
    # Return the count of '1's
    return count_of_ones
```

This function will correctly count the number of set bits in the binary representation of the given integer.

    # We use slicing [2:] to remove the '0b' prefix
