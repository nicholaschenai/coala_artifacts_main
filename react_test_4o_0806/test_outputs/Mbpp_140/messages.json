The function should return a set containing all the unique numbers from these tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, we will iterate over each number.\n   - We will add each number to a set, which automatically handles duplicates.\n   - Finally, we will return the set containing all unique numbers.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function extract_singly that takes a list of tuples as input\n       Initialize an empty set called result_set\n       For each tuple in the list\n           For each number in the tuple\n               Add the number to result_set\n       Return result_set\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_singly(list_of_tuples):\n    # Initialize an empty set to store unique numbers\n    result_set = set()\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for tuple_ in list_of_tuples:\n        # Iterate over each number in the current tuple\n        for number in tuple_:\n            # Add the number to the set (duplicates are automatically handled)\n            result_set.add(number)\n    \n    # Return the set containing all unique numbers\n    return result_set\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through each element in the list of tuples and adds each number to a set, ensuring that only unique numbers are stored. The function then returns this set."
