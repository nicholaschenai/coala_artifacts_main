You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/140 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numbers. The function should return a set containing all the unique numbers from these tuples.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, we will iterate over each number.
   - We will add each number to a set, which automatically handles duplicates.
   - Finally, we will return the set containing all unique numbers.

3. **Pseudocode Solution:**
   ```
   Define function extract_singly that takes a list of tuples as input
       Initialize an empty set called result_set
       For each tuple in the list
           For each number in the tuple
               Add the number to result_set
       Return result_set
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def extract_singly(list_of_tuples):
    # Initialize an empty set to store unique numbers
    result_set = set()
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for tuple_ in list_of_tuples:
        # Iterate over each number in the current tuple
        for number in tuple_:
            # Add the number to the set (duplicates are automatically handled)
            result_set.add(number)
    
    # Return the set containing all unique numbers
    return result_set
```

This solution iterates through each element in the list of tuples and adds each number to a set, ensuring that only unique numbers are stored. The function then returns this set.
