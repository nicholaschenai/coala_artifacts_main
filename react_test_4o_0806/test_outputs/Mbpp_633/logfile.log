INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/633 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the XOR of all unique pairs of numbers in a given list. The function should take a list of integers and the length of the list as inputs, and return the sum of the XOR values for all possible pairs.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand XOR Operation**: XOR (exclusive or) is a binary operation that takes two bits and returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. For integers, XOR is applied bitwise.

2. **Identify Pairs**: For a list of `n` numbers, we need to consider all unique pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.

3. **Calculate XOR for Each Pair**: For each pair `(i, j)`, compute the XOR of the two numbers.

4. **Sum the XOR Values**: Accumulate the XOR values for all pairs to get the final result.

### Pseudocode

```
function pair_xor_Sum(arr, n):
    initialize sum_xor to 0
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        for j from i+1 to n-1:
            compute xor_value as arr[i] XOR arr[j]
            add xor_value to sum_xor
    return sum_xor
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def pair_xor_Sum(arr, n):
    # Initialize the sum of XORs to zero
    sum_xor = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for i in range(n):
        # For each element, iterate over the elements that come after it
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Calculate the XOR of the current pair
            xor_value = arr[i] ^ arr[j]
            # Add the XOR value to the total sum
            sum_xor += xor_value
    
    # Return the total sum of XORs
    return sum_xor
```

This solution iterates over all unique pairs of elements in the list, calculates their XOR, and accumulates the result. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, which is efficient enough for moderate-sized lists.
