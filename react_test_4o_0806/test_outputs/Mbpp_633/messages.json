        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the sum of the XOR of all unique pairs of numbers in a given list. The function should take a list of integers and the length of the list as inputs, and return the sum of the XOR values for all possible pairs.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand XOR Operation**: XOR (exclusive or) is a binary operation that takes two bits and returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. For integers, XOR is applied bitwise.\n\n2. **Identify Pairs**: For a list of `n` numbers, we need to consider all unique pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.\n\n3. **Calculate XOR for Each Pair**: For each pair `(i, j)`, compute the XOR of the two numbers.\n\n4. **Sum the XOR Values**: Accumulate the XOR values for all pairs to get the final result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction pair_xor_Sum(arr, n):\n    initialize sum_xor to 0\n    for i from 0 to n-1:\n        for j from i+1 to n-1:\n            compute xor_value as arr[i] XOR arr[j]\n            add xor_value to sum_xor\n    return sum_xor\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef pair_xor_Sum(arr, n):\n    # Initialize the sum of XORs to zero\n    sum_xor = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for i in range(n):\n        # For each element, iterate over the elements that come after it\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            # Calculate the XOR of the current pair\n            xor_value = arr[i] ^ arr[j]\n            # Add the XOR value to the total sum\n            sum_xor += xor_value\n    \n    # Return the total sum of XORs\n    return sum_xor\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over all unique pairs of elements in the list, calculates their XOR, and accumulates the result. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, which is efficient enough for moderate-sized lists."
