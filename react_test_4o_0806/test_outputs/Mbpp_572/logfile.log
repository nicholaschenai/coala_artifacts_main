You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the numbers that appear exactly once in the original list. In other words, we need to remove all numbers that have duplicates in the list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we need to determine how many times each number appears in the list.
2. **Filter Unique Numbers**: Once we have the counts, we can create a new list that includes only the numbers that appear exactly once.
3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of unique numbers.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the count of each number.
2. Iterate over each number in the input list:
   - If the number is already in the dictionary, increment its count.
   - If the number is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.
3. Initialize an empty list to store the unique numbers.
4. Iterate over the dictionary:
   - For each number with a count of 1, add it to the list of unique numbers.
5. Return the list of unique numbers.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def two_unique_nums(nums):
    # Step 1: Count occurrences of each number
    count_dict = {}
    for num in nums:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    
    # Step 2: Filter numbers that appear exactly once
    unique_nums = []
    for num, count in count_dict.items():
        if count == 1:
            unique_nums.append(num)
    
    # Step 3: Return the list of unique numbers
    return unique_nums
```

This solution efficiently counts the occurrences of each number using a dictionary and then filters out the numbers that appear more than once. The final list contains only those numbers that are unique in the input list.
