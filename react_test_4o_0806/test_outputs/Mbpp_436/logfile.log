You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/436 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the negative numbers from the original list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through each number in the input list.
   - For each number, we will check if it is negative (i.e., less than zero).
   - If a number is negative, we will add it to a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list containing all the negative numbers.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function neg_nos with parameter nums (a list of integers)
       Initialize an empty list called negative_numbers
       For each number in nums
           If the number is less than zero
               Append the number to negative_numbers
       Return negative_numbers
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def neg_nos(nums):
    # Initialize an empty list to store negative numbers
    negative_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # Check if the number is negative
        if num < 0:
            # If negative, append it to the negative_numbers list
            negative_numbers.append(num)
    
    # Return the list of negative numbers
    return negative_numbers
```

This function will correctly filter out and return only the negative numbers from the input list.
