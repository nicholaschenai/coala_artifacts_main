    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two numbers. The function should calculate the product of the two numbers in each tuple, find the absolute value of each product, and then return the maximum absolute product from all the tuples.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum absolute product found so far.\n2. Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n3. For each tuple, calculate the product of the two numbers.\n4. Take the absolute value of the product.\n5. Compare this absolute product with the current maximum absolute product and update the maximum if this one is larger.\n6. After iterating through all tuples, return the maximum absolute product found.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_product_tuple(list_of_tuples):\n    max_abs_product = 0\n    for each tuple in list_of_tuples:\n        product = first element of tuple * second element of tuple\n        abs_product = absolute value of product\n        if abs_product > max_abs_product:\n            max_abs_product = abs_product\n    return max_abs_product\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_product_tuple(list_of_tuples):\n    # Initialize the maximum absolute product to zero\n    max_abs_product = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for t in list_of_tuples:\n        # Calculate the product of the two numbers in the tuple\n        product = t[0] * t[1]\n        \n        # Calculate the absolute value of the product\n        abs_product = abs(product)\n        \n        # Update the maximum absolute product if the current one is larger\n        if abs_product > max_abs_product:\n            max_abs_product = abs_product\n    \n    # Return the maximum absolute product found\n    return max_abs_product\n```",
