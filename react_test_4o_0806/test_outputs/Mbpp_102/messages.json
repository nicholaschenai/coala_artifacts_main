In snake_case, words are separated by underscores, and all letters are typically lowercase. In CamelCase, each word starts with an uppercase letter and there are no underscores.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Split the input string by underscores to separate the words.\n2. Capitalize the first letter of each word.\n3. Join the capitalized words together without any spaces or underscores.\n4. Return the resulting string.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `snake_to_camel` that takes a single string `s`.\n2. Split the string `s` by the underscore character `_` to get a list of words.\n3. For each word in the list, capitalize the first letter.\n4. Join all the capitalized words into a single string.\n5. Return the resulting string.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef snake_to_camel(s: str) -> str:\n    # Split the input string by underscores to get individual words\n    words = s.split('_')\n    # Capitalize the first letter of each word and join them together\n    camel_case = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)\n    # Return the resulting CamelCase string\n    return camel_case\n```"
