You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/102 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that converts a string from snake_case to CamelCase. In snake_case, words are separated by underscores, and all letters are typically lowercase. In CamelCase, each word starts with an uppercase letter and there are no underscores.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Split the input string by underscores to separate the words.
2. Capitalize the first letter of each word.
3. Join the capitalized words together without any spaces or underscores.
4. Return the resulting string.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `snake_to_camel` that takes a single string `s`.
2. Split the string `s` by the underscore character `_` to get a list of words.
3. For each word in the list, capitalize the first letter.
4. Join all the capitalized words into a single string.
5. Return the resulting string.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def snake_to_camel(s: str) -> str:
    # Split the input string by underscores to get individual words
    words = s.split('_')
    # Capitalize the first letter of each word and join them together
    camel_case = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)
    # Return the resulting CamelCase string
    return camel_case
```
