        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that checks if one list is a sublist of another list. A sublist is a sequence that appears in the same order within another list. The function should return `True` if the second list is a sublist of the first list, and `False` otherwise.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo determine if one list is a sublist of another, we can iterate through the first list and check if the second list appears as a contiguous sequence within it. This can be done by checking each possible starting position in the first list and seeing if the elements of the second list match the elements in the first list starting from that position.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `is_Sub_Array` that takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`.\n2. If `list2` is empty, return `True` because an empty list is a sublist of any list.\n3. If `list1` is shorter than `list2`, return `False` because a longer list cannot be a sublist of a shorter one.\n4. Iterate over each possible starting index `i` in `list1` where `list2` could fit:\n   - For each index `i`, check if the slice of `list1` from `i` to `i + len(list2)` matches `list2`.\n   - If a match is found, return `True`.\n5. If no match is found after checking all possible starting positions, return `False`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_Sub_Array(list1, list2):\n    # If list2 is empty, it is trivially a sublist of any list\n    if not list2:\n        return True\n    \n    # If list1 is shorter than list2, list2 cannot be a sublist\n    if len(list1) < len(list2):\n        return False\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible starting index in list1\n    for i in range(len(list1) - len(list2) + 1):\n        # Check if the slice of list1 matches list2\n        if list1[i:i + len(list2)] == list2:\n            return True\n    \n    # If no match is found, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently checks for the presence of `list2` as a sublist within `list1` by iterating over possible starting positions and comparing slices of `list1` to `list2`."
