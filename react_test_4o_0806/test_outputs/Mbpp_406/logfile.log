You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that determines if a given integer has an odd parity. In simpler terms, the function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand Parity**: Parity refers to whether a number is odd or even. A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2, and even if it is divisible by 2.
2. **Determine Oddness**: To check if a number is odd, we can use the modulus operator `%`. If `number % 2` equals 1, the number is odd.
3. **Return Result**: Based on the modulus operation, return `True` if the number is odd, otherwise return `False`.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_Parity(number):
    if number % 2 is not equal to 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_Parity(number: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the number is odd by using the modulus operator
    # If the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero, it's odd
    if number % 2 != 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function checks the parity of the input number and returns `True` if the number is odd, otherwise it returns `False`.

        return True
