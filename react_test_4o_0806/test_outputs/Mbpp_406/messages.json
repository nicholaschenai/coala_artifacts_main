In simpler terms, the function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Parity**: Parity refers to whether a number is odd or even. A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2, and even if it is divisible by 2.\n2. **Determine Oddness**: To check if a number is odd, we can use the modulus operator `%`. If `number % 2` equals 1, the number is odd.\n3. **Return Result**: Based on the modulus operation, return `True` if the number is odd, otherwise return `False`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_Parity(number):\n    if number % 2 is not equal to 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_Parity(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is odd by using the modulus operator\n    # If the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero, it's odd\n    if number % 2 != 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function checks the parity of the input number and returns `True` if the number is odd, otherwise it returns `False`."
