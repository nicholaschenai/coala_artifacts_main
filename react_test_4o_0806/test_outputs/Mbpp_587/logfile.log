You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/587 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the same elements in the same order.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Python provides a built-in function `tuple()` that can convert a list to a tuple. We can use this function to convert the input list to a tuple and return it.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `list_tuple` that takes a single parameter `lst`.
   - Use the `tuple()` function to convert `lst` to a tuple.
   - Return the resulting tuple.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def list_tuple(lst: list) -> tuple:
    # Convert the input list to a tuple using the tuple() function
    result = tuple(lst)
    # Return the resulting tuple
    return result
```

This function will take a list as input and return a tuple with the same elements, satisfying the problem requirements.
