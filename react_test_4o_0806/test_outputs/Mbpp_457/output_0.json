    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist with the smallest length. If there are multiple sublists with the same minimum length, the function should return the first one it encounters.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start by assuming the first sublist is the shortest.\n   - Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists.\n   - For each sublist, compare its length to the current shortest sublist.\n   - If a sublist is shorter, update the shortest sublist to this one.\n   - After checking all sublists, return the shortest one found.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function Find_Min(list_of_lists):\n       if list_of_lists is empty:\n           return an empty list\n       \n       set shortest_sublist to the first sublist in list_of_lists\n       \n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           if length of sublist is less than length of shortest_sublist:\n               set shortest_sublist to sublist\n       \n       return shortest_sublist\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min(list_of_lists):\n    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list\n    if not list_of_lists:\n        return []\n    \n    # Assume the first sublist is the shortest initially\n    shortest_sublist = list_of_lists[0]\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # If the current sublist is shorter than the shortest found so far\n        if len(sublist) < len(shortest_sublist):\n            # Update the shortest sublist\n            shortest_sublist = sublist\n    \n    # Return the shortest sublist found\n    return shortest_sublist\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list of lists once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of sublists. It correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list.",
