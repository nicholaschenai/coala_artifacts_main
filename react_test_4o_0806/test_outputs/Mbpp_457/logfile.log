You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/457 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist with the smallest length. If there are multiple sublists with the same minimum length, the function should return the first one it encounters.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Start by assuming the first sublist is the shortest.
   - Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists.
   - For each sublist, compare its length to the current shortest sublist.
   - If a sublist is shorter, update the shortest sublist to this one.
   - After checking all sublists, return the shortest one found.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function Find_Min(list_of_lists):
       if list_of_lists is empty:
           return an empty list
       
       set shortest_sublist to the first sublist in list_of_lists
       
       for each sublist in list_of_lists:
           if length of sublist is less than length of shortest_sublist:
               set shortest_sublist to sublist
       
       return shortest_sublist
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def Find_Min(list_of_lists):
    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list
    if not list_of_lists:
        return []
    
    # Assume the first sublist is the shortest initially
    shortest_sublist = list_of_lists[0]
    
    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # If the current sublist is shorter than the shortest found so far
        if len(sublist) < len(shortest_sublist):
            # Update the shortest sublist
            shortest_sublist = sublist
    
    # Return the shortest sublist found
    return shortest_sublist
```

This solution iterates through the list of lists once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of sublists. It correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list.

        # If the current sublist is shorter than the shortest found so far
        if len(sublist) < len(shortest_sublist):
            # Update the shortest sublist
            shortest_sublist = sublist
    
    # Return the shortest sublist found
