You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/94 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We have a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a number. We need to find the tuple with the smallest number and return the name from that tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through the list of tuples to find the tuple with the smallest second value (the number). We will keep track of the smallest number found so far and the corresponding name. Once we have checked all tuples, we will return the name associated with the smallest number.

3. **Pseudocode Solution:**
   - Initialize a variable to store the smallest number found so far, set it to a very large number initially.
   - Initialize a variable to store the name associated with the smallest number.
   - Loop through each tuple in the list:
     - If the number in the current tuple is smaller than the smallest number found so far:
       - Update the smallest number.
       - Update the name associated with this smallest number.
   - After the loop, return the name associated with the smallest number.

4. **Final Python 3 Solution:**

```python
def index_minimum(tuples_list):
    # Initialize the smallest number to a very large value
    smallest_number = float('inf')
    # Initialize the name associated with the smallest number
    smallest_name = None
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for name, number in tuples_list:
        # Check if the current number is smaller than the smallest number found so far
        if number < smallest_number:
            # Update the smallest number
            smallest_number = number
            # Update the name associated with the smallest number
            smallest_name = name
    
    # Return the name associated with the smallest number
    return smallest_name
```

This solution iterates through the list of tuples once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of tuples in the list.
