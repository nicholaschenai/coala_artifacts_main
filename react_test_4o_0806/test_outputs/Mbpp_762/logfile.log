You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/762 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

The task is to determine if a given month, represented by a number from 1 to 12, has 30 days. The function should return `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Months with 30 Days**: The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).
2. **Check the Month**: Given a month number, check if it is one of the months identified in step 1.
3. **Return the Result**: If the month number is one of those with 30 days, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

```
function check_monthnumber_number(month_number):
    if month_number is in [4, 6, 9, 11]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def check_monthnumber_number(month_number: int) -> bool:
    # List of month numbers that have 30 days
    months_with_30_days = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    
    # Check if the given month number is in the list
    if month_number in months_with_30_days:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This solution checks if the given month number is one of the months that have 30 days and returns the appropriate boolean value.
