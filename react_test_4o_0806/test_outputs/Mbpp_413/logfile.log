You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/413 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `n` as inputs. The function should return a list containing the `n`-th element from each tuple in the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, we will extract the element at the index `n`.
   - We will collect these elements into a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function extract_nth_element with parameters list_of_tuples and n
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each tuple in list_of_tuples
           Append the element at index n of the tuple to result
       Return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def extract_nth_element(list_of_tuples, n):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the nth elements
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for tuple_item in list_of_tuples:
        # Append the nth element of the current tuple to the result list
        result.append(tuple_item[n])
    
    # Return the list of nth elements
    return result
```

This function will correctly extract the `n`-th element from each tuple in the provided list and return a list of these elements.

        # Append the nth element of the current tuple to the result list
        result.append(tuple_item[n])
