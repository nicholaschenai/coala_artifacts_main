You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/238 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the number of non-empty substrings for a given string. A substring is any sequence of characters that appears consecutively within the string. For example, the string "abc" has the following non-empty substrings: "a", "b", "c", "ab", "bc", and "abc".

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the number of non-empty substrings of a string, we can use the following approach:
   - For a string of length `n`, the number of non-empty substrings can be calculated using the formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - This formula works because for each character in the string, we can form substrings starting from that character to the end of the string. For example, for a string of length 3 ("abc"), the substrings are:
     - Starting from the first character: "a", "ab", "abc"
     - Starting from the second character: "b", "bc"
     - Starting from the third character: "c"
   - The total number of substrings is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function number_of_substrings(s):
       n = length of s
       return n * (n + 1) / 2
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def number_of_substrings(s: str) -> int:
    # Calculate the length of the string
    n = len(s)
    # Use the formula to calculate the number of non-empty substrings
    # The formula is n * (n + 1) / 2
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

This function calculates the number of non-empty substrings by using the mathematical formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which efficiently gives us the desired result.
