    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the number of non-empty substrings for a given string. A substring is any sequence of characters that appears consecutively within the string. For example, the string \"abc\" has the following non-empty substrings: \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"ab\", \"bc\", and \"abc\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the number of non-empty substrings of a string, we can use the following approach:\n   - For a string of length `n`, the number of non-empty substrings can be calculated using the formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n   - This formula works because for each character in the string, we can form substrings starting from that character to the end of the string. For example, for a string of length 3 (\"abc\"), the substrings are:\n     - Starting from the first character: \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\"\n     - Starting from the second character: \"b\", \"bc\"\n     - Starting from the third character: \"c\"\n   - The total number of substrings is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function number_of_substrings(s):\n       n = length of s\n       return n * (n + 1) / 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(s: str) -> int:\n    # Calculate the length of the string\n    n = len(s)\n    # Use the formula to calculate the number of non-empty substrings\n    # The formula is n * (n + 1) / 2\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function calculates the number of non-empty substrings by using the mathematical formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which efficiently gives us the desired result.",
