The function should return a tuple containing the sum and the average.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Sum of First n Natural Numbers**: The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   This formula is derived from the arithmetic series sum formula.\n\n2. **Average of First n Natural Numbers**: Once we have the sum, the average can be calculated by dividing the sum by `n`.\n\n3. **Return the Result**: The function should return a tuple containing the sum and the average.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction sum_average(n):\n    sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2\n    average = sum / n\n    return (sum, average)\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef sum_average(n: int) -> tuple:\n    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula\n    sum_n = (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n    \n    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by n\n    average_n = sum_n / n\n    \n    # Return the sum and average as a tuple\n    return (sum_n, average_n)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the sum and average using mathematical formulas, ensuring that the function runs in constant time, O(1). The use of integer division `//` ensures that the sum is an integer, which is appropriate since the sum of natural numbers is always an integer. The average is calculated as a float, which is suitable for the division operation."
