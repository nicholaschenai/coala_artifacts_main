You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/720 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a tuple and a dictionary as inputs and returns a new tuple that includes all the elements of the original tuple followed by the dictionary as the last element.

## Conceptual Solution

1. The function will accept two parameters: a tuple and a dictionary.
2. We will create a new tuple by concatenating the original tuple with a single-element tuple containing the dictionary.
3. The result will be a tuple that includes all the elements of the original tuple and the dictionary as the last element.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `add_dict_to_tuple` that takes two parameters: `input_tuple` and `input_dict`.
2. Create a new tuple by concatenating `input_tuple` with a tuple containing `input_dict`.
3. Return the new tuple.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def add_dict_to_tuple(input_tuple: tuple, input_dict: dict) -> tuple:
    # Concatenate the input tuple with a tuple containing the input dictionary
    result_tuple = input_tuple + (input_dict,)
    # Return the resulting tuple
    return result_tuple
```
