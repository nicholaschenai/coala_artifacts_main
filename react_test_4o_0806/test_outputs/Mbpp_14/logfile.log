We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The function will take three parameters: the base of the triangle, the height of the triangle, and the length of the prism. The function should return the volume of the prism.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the formula for the volume of a triangular prism**: 
   - The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length}
     \]
   - The base area of the triangular face is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
     \]
   - Therefore, the volume of the prism is:
     \[
     V = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}\right) \times \text{Length}
     \]

2. **Plan the function**:
   - The function will take three arguments: `base`, `height`, and `length`.
   - Calculate the base area using the formula for the area of a triangle.
   - Multiply the base area by the length to get the volume.
   - Return the calculated volume.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_Volume(base, height, length):
    base_area = (1/2) * base * height
    volume = base_area * length
    return volume
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_Volume(base: float, height: float, length: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the area of the triangular base
    base_area = 0.5 * base * height
    # Calculate the volume of the triangular prism
    volume = base_area * length
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
```
