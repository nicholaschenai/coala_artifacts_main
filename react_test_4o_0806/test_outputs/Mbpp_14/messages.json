The function will take three parameters: the base of the triangle, the height of the triangle, and the length of the prism. The function should return the volume of the prism.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the formula for the volume of a triangular prism**: \n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     V = \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Length}\n     \\]\n   - The base area of the triangular face is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Base Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the volume of the prism is:\n     \\[\n     V = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height}\\right) \\times \\text{Length}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Plan the function**:\n   - The function will take three arguments: `base`, `height`, and `length`.\n   - Calculate the base area using the formula for the area of a triangle.\n   - Multiply the base area by the length to get the volume.\n   - Return the calculated volume.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_Volume(base, height, length):\n    base_area = (1/2) * base * height\n    volume = base_area * length\n    return volume\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_Volume(base: float, height: float, length: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the area of the triangular base\n    base_area = 0.5 * base * height\n    # Calculate the volume of the triangular prism\n    volume = base_area * length\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```"
