The function will take the length of one side of the pentagon as input and return the total perimeter.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - A regular pentagon has five equal sides.\n   - To find the perimeter of a regular pentagon, we simply multiply the length of one side by 5.\n   - The function will take one argument, which is the length of a side, and return the result of multiplying this length by 5.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function perimeter_pentagon with one parameter: side_length\n       Calculate perimeter by multiplying side_length by 5\n       Return the calculated perimeter\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 5\n    perimeter = side_length * 5\n    # Return the calculated perimeter\n    return perimeter\n```\n\nThis function takes the length of one side of a regular pentagon and returns the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 5."
