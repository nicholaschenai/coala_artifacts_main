You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/171 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon. The function will take the length of one side of the pentagon as input and return the total perimeter.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - A regular pentagon has five equal sides.
   - To find the perimeter of a regular pentagon, we simply multiply the length of one side by 5.
   - The function will take one argument, which is the length of a side, and return the result of multiplying this length by 5.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function perimeter_pentagon with one parameter: side_length
       Calculate perimeter by multiplying side_length by 5
       Return the calculated perimeter
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def perimeter_pentagon(side_length: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 5
    perimeter = side_length * 5
    # Return the calculated perimeter
    return perimeter
```

This function takes the length of one side of a regular pentagon and returns the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 5.
