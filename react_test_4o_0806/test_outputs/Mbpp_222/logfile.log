You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/222 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, we need to determine the data type of the first element in the tuple.
   - Then, we will iterate through the rest of the elements in the tuple.
   - For each element, we will check if its data type matches the data type of the first element.
   - If we find any element with a different data type, we will return `False`.
   - If we complete the iteration without finding any mismatched data types, we will return `True`.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function check_type with parameter tuple_data
       If tuple_data is empty, return True (since there are no elements to compare)
       Get the data type of the first element in tuple_data and store it in a variable first_type
       For each element in tuple_data
           If the data type of the element is not equal to first_type
               Return False
       Return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_type(tuple_data: tuple) -> bool:
    # If the tuple is empty, return True as there are no elements to compare
    if not tuple_data:
        return True
    
    # Get the data type of the first element
    first_type = type(tuple_data[0])
    
    # Iterate through each element in the tuple
    for element in tuple_data:
        # If the type of the current element is not the same as the first element's type
        if type(element) != first_type:
            # Return False as not all elements have the same type
            return False
    
    # If all elements have the same type, return True
    return True
```

This solution checks the data type of each element in the tuple against the first element's data type and returns `True` only if all elements have the same type.

            return False
