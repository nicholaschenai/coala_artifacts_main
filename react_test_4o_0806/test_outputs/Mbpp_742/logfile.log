INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/742 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the surface area of a regular tetrahedron given the length of its edge. A regular tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four equilateral triangular faces.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Geometry**: A regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangular faces. If the edge length of the tetrahedron is `a`, then each face is an equilateral triangle with side length `a`.

2. **Area of an Equilateral Triangle**: The area \( A \) of an equilateral triangle with side length \( a \) is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times a^2
   \]

3. **Surface Area of the Tetrahedron**: Since a regular tetrahedron has four identical equilateral triangular faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:
   \[
   S = 4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times a^2 = \sqrt{3} \times a^2
   \]

4. **Implement the Formula**: Use the formula for the surface area of a tetrahedron to compute the result given the edge length.

### Pseudocode

```
function area_tetrahedron(a):
    # Calculate the area of one equilateral triangle face
    area_of_one_face = (sqrt(3) / 4) * a^2
    
    # Calculate the total surface area of the tetrahedron
    total_surface_area = 4 * area_of_one_face
    
    # Return the total surface area
    return total_surface_area
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def area_tetrahedron(a: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the area of one equilateral triangle face
    area_of_one_face = (3**0.5 / 4) * a**2
    
    # Calculate the total surface area of the tetrahedron
    total_surface_area = 4 * area_of_one_face
    
    # Return the total surface area
    return total_surface_area
```

This function calculates the surface area of a regular tetrahedron by first determining the area of one of its equilateral triangular faces and then multiplying by four to get the total surface area.
