        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the surface area of a regular tetrahedron given the length of its edge. A regular tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four equilateral triangular faces.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry**: A regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangular faces. If the edge length of the tetrahedron is `a`, then each face is an equilateral triangle with side length `a`.\n\n2. **Area of an Equilateral Triangle**: The area \\( A \\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( a \\) is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times a^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Surface Area of the Tetrahedron**: Since a regular tetrahedron has four identical equilateral triangular faces, the total surface area \\( S \\) is:\n   \\[\n   S = 4 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times a^2 = \\sqrt{3} \\times a^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Implement the Formula**: Use the formula for the surface area of a tetrahedron to compute the result given the edge length.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction area_tetrahedron(a):\n    # Calculate the area of one equilateral triangle face\n    area_of_one_face = (sqrt(3) / 4) * a^2\n    \n    # Calculate the total surface area of the tetrahedron\n    total_surface_area = 4 * area_of_one_face\n    \n    # Return the total surface area\n    return total_surface_area\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef area_tetrahedron(a: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the area of one equilateral triangle face\n    area_of_one_face = (3**0.5 / 4) * a**2\n    \n    # Calculate the total surface area of the tetrahedron\n    total_surface_area = 4 * area_of_one_face\n    \n    # Return the total surface area\n    return total_surface_area\n```\n\nThis function calculates the surface area of a regular tetrahedron by first determining the area of one of its equilateral triangular faces and then multiplying by four to get the total surface area."
