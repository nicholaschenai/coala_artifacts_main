This allows us to easily access the first character of the string, which corresponds to the first digit of the number. We then convert this character back to an integer and return it.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Convert the input number to a string.\n   - Access the first character of the string.\n   - Convert this character back to an integer.\n   - Return the integer.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef first_Digit(n: int) -> int:\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    n_str = str(n)\n    # Get the first character of the string\n    first_char = n_str[0]\n    # Convert the first character back to an integer\n    first_digit = int(first_char)\n    # Return the first digit\n    return first_digit\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the first digit of any given integer by following the steps outlined above."
