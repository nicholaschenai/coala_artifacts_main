You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/567 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that checks if a given list of numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list is sorted, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through the list and compare each element with the next one.
   - If we find any element that is greater than the next element, we can conclude that the list is not sorted and return `False`.
   - If we complete the iteration without finding any such pair, the list is sorted, and we return `True`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function issort_list that takes a list as input
       For each index i from 0 to length of list - 2
           If the element at index i is greater than the element at index i + 1
               Return False
       Return True
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def issort_list(lst):
    # Iterate through the list up to the second last element
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        # Compare the current element with the next element
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            # If the current element is greater, the list is not sorted
            return False
    # If no such pair is found, the list is sorted
    return True
```

This function will correctly determine if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by checking each pair of consecutive elements. If any element is found to be greater than the next, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements.
