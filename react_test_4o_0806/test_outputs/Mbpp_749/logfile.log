You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

We need to create a function that takes a list of strings, where each string represents a number. The function should convert these strings to integers, sort them in ascending order, and return the sorted list of integers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Convert Strings to Integers**: First, we need to convert each string in the list to an integer. This will allow us to sort them numerically rather than lexicographically (which is how strings are sorted by default).
   
2. **Sort the List**: Once we have a list of integers, we can sort it using Python's built-in sorting functionality, which sorts numbers in ascending order by default.

3. **Return the Sorted List**: Finally, we return the sorted list of integers.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `sort_numeric_strings` that takes a list of strings as input.
2. Convert each string in the list to an integer.
3. Sort the list of integers.
4. Return the sorted list.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def sort_numeric_strings(lst: list) -> list:
    # Convert each string in the list to an integer
    int_list = [int(num) for num in lst]
    
    # Sort the list of integers
    int_list.sort()
    
    # Return the sorted list
    return int_list
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the conceptual solution and pseudocode. It uses list comprehension to convert the strings to integers and the `sort()` method to sort the list. The function then returns the sorted list of integers.
