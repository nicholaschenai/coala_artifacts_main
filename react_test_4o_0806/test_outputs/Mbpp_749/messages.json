The function should convert these strings to integers, sort them in ascending order, and return the sorted list of integers.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Convert Strings to Integers**: First, we need to convert each string in the list to an integer. This will allow us to sort them numerically rather than lexicographically (which is how strings are sorted by default).\n   \n2. **Sort the List**: Once we have a list of integers, we can sort it using Python's built-in sorting functionality, which sorts numbers in ascending order by default.\n\n3. **Return the Sorted List**: Finally, we return the sorted list of integers.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `sort_numeric_strings` that takes a list of strings as input.\n2. Convert each string in the list to an integer.\n3. Sort the list of integers.\n4. Return the sorted list.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef sort_numeric_strings(lst: list) -> list:\n    # Convert each string in the list to an integer\n    int_list = [int(num) for num in lst]\n    \n    # Sort the list of integers\n    int_list.sort()\n    \n    # Return the sorted list\n    return int_list\n```\n\nThis solution follows the steps outlined in the conceptual solution and pseudocode. It uses list comprehension to convert the strings to integers and the `sort()` method to sort the list. The function then returns the sorted list of integers."
