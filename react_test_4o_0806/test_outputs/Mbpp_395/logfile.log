You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/395 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the first character in the string that does not repeat. If all characters in the string repeat, the function should return `None`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through the string and count the occurrences of each character using a dictionary.
   - After counting, we will iterate through the string again to find the first character that has a count of 1 in the dictionary.
   - If such a character is found, we return it. If no such character is found, we return `None`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function first_non_repeating_character(s):
       create an empty dictionary called char_count
       
       for each character c in the string s:
           if c is in char_count:
               increment the count of c in char_count
           else:
               set the count of c in char_count to 1
       
       for each character c in the string s:
           if the count of c in char_count is 1:
               return c
       
       return None
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def first_non_repeating_character(s: str) -> str:
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each character
    char_count = {}
    
    # Count the occurrences of each character in the string
    for c in s:
        if c in char_count:
            char_count[c] += 1
        else:
            char_count[c] = 1
    
    # Find the first character with a count of 1
    for c in s:
        if char_count[c] == 1:
            return c
    
    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None
    return None
```

This solution iterates over the string twice: once to count the characters and once to find the first non-repeating character. The use of a dictionary allows us to efficiently count and look up the occurrences of each character.
