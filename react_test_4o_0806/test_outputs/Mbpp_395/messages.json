        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the first character in the string that does not repeat. If all characters in the string repeat, the function should return `None`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through the string and count the occurrences of each character using a dictionary.\n   - After counting, we will iterate through the string again to find the first character that has a count of 1 in the dictionary.\n   - If such a character is found, we return it. If no such character is found, we return `None`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function first_non_repeating_character(s):\n       create an empty dictionary called char_count\n       \n       for each character c in the string s:\n           if c is in char_count:\n               increment the count of c in char_count\n           else:\n               set the count of c in char_count to 1\n       \n       for each character c in the string s:\n           if the count of c in char_count is 1:\n               return c\n       \n       return None\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_character(s: str) -> str:\n    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each character\n    char_count = {}\n    \n    # Count the occurrences of each character in the string\n    for c in s:\n        if c in char_count:\n            char_count[c] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[c] = 1\n    \n    # Find the first character with a count of 1\n    for c in s:\n        if char_count[c] == 1:\n            return c\n    \n    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None\n    return None\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over the string twice: once to count the characters and once to find the first non-repeating character. The use of a dictionary allows us to efficiently count and look up the occurrences of each character."
