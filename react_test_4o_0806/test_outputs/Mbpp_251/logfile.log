You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/251 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to create a function that takes a list and an element as inputs. The function should insert the given element before each item in the list and return the modified list.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can iterate over the original list and for each element, insert the given element before it. We can achieve this by creating a new list and appending the given element followed by the current element from the original list. Finally, we return the new list.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

1. Initialize an empty list called `result`.
2. Loop through each element in the input list:
   - Append the given element to `result`.
   - Append the current element from the list to `result`.
3. Return the `result` list.

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def insert_element(lst: list, element) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each item in the input list
    for item in lst:
        # Insert the given element before the current item
        result.append(element)
        # Append the current item to the result list
        result.append(item)
    
    # Return the modified list
    return result
```

This function will take a list and an element, and it will insert the element before each item in the list, returning the new list as specified.

        # Insert the given element before the current item
        result.append(element)
        # Append the current item to the result list
        result.append(item)
