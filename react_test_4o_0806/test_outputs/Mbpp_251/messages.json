Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a list and an element as inputs. The function should insert the given element before each item in the list and return the modified list.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can iterate over the original list and for each element, insert the given element before it. We can achieve this by creating a new list and appending the given element followed by the current element from the original list. Finally, we return the new list.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n1. Initialize an empty list called `result`.\n2. Loop through each element in the input list:\n   - Append the given element to `result`.\n   - Append the current element from the list to `result`.\n3. Return the `result` list.\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef insert_element(lst: list, element) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each item in the input list\n    for item in lst:\n        # Insert the given element before the current item\n        result.append(element)\n        # Append the current item to the result list\n        result.append(item)\n    \n    # Return the modified list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take a list and an element, and it will insert the element before each item in the list, returning the new list as specified."
