    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that checks if all the tuples in a given list have the same length. If all tuples have the same length, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Extract Lengths**: First, we will extract the length of each tuple in the list.\n2. **Check Uniformity**: We will then check if all these lengths are the same.\n3. **Return Result**: If all lengths are equal, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `get_equal` that takes a list of tuples as input.\n2. If the list is empty, return `True` because there are no tuples to compare.\n3. Extract the length of the first tuple and store it in a variable `first_length`.\n4. Iterate over each tuple in the list:\n   - If the length of the current tuple is not equal to `first_length`, return `False`.\n5. If the loop completes without returning `False`, return `True`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef get_equal(tuples: list) -> bool:\n    # If the list is empty, all tuples (none) have the same length by default\n    if not tuples:\n        return True\n    \n    # Get the length of the first tuple\n    first_length = len(tuples[0])\n    \n    # Check if all tuples have the same length as the first one\n    for t in tuples:\n        if len(t) != first_length:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all tuples have the same length, return True\n    return True\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list of tuples, comparing each tuple's length to the first tuple's length. If any tuple has a different length, it returns `False`. If all tuples have the same length, it returns `True`.",
