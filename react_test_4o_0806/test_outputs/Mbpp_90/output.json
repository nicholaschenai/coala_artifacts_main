    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest word in that list.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate through each word in the list.\n2. For each word, we will calculate its length.\n3. We will keep track of the maximum length encountered so far.\n4. After checking all words, we will return the maximum length found.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction len_log(words):\n    initialize max_length to 0\n    for each word in words:\n        calculate the length of the word\n        if the length is greater than max_length:\n            update max_length to this length\n    return max_length\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef len_log(words: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum length to 0\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words:\n        # Calculate the length of the current word\n        current_length = len(word)\n        \n        # If the current word's length is greater than the max_length, update max_length\n        if current_length > max_length:\n            max_length = current_length\n    \n    # Return the maximum length found\n    return max_length\n```",
