You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/253 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list as input and returns the count of elements in the list that are integers.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each element in the list.
   - For each element, we will check if it is an integer.
   - We will maintain a counter to keep track of how many integers we have encountered.
   - Finally, we will return the counter as the result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function named count_integer that takes a list as input.
   Initialize a counter to 0.
   For each element in the list:
       Check if the element is an integer.
       If it is, increment the counter by 1.
   Return the counter.
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def count_integer(lst):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of integer elements
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for element in lst:
        # Check if the current element is an integer
        if isinstance(element, int):
            # Increment the counter if the element is an integer
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of integer elements
    return count
```

This function will correctly count and return the number of integer elements in the provided list.
