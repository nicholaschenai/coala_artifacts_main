The function should return a new list that contains only the elements from the first list that are not present in the second list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate through each element in the first list.\n   - For each element, we will check if it is present in the second list.\n   - If the element is not in the second list, we will add it to a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return this new list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function remove_elements(list1, list2):\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each element in list1:\n           If the element is not in list2:\n               Append the element to result\n       Return result\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not, append it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the result list containing elements not in list2\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each element in `list1` and checks if it is not present in `list2`. If the element is not found in `list2`, it is added to the `result` list, which is returned at the end. This approach ensures that all elements from `list1` that are not in `list2` are included in the output list."
