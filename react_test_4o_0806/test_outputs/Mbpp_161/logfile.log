You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/161 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes two lists as input. The function should return a new list that contains only the elements from the first list that are not present in the second list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through each element in the first list.
   - For each element, we will check if it is present in the second list.
   - If the element is not in the second list, we will add it to a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function remove_elements(list1, list2):
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each element in list1:
           If the element is not in list2:
               Append the element to result
       Return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each element in the first list
    for element in list1:
        # Check if the element is not in the second list
        if element not in list2:
            # If not, append it to the result list
            result.append(element)
    
    # Return the result list containing elements not in list2
    return result
```

This solution iterates over each element in `list1` and checks if it is not present in `list2`. If the element is not found in `list2`, it is added to the `result` list, which is returned at the end. This approach ensures that all elements from `list1` that are not in `list2` are included in the output list.

        # Check if the element is not in the second list

            # If not, append it to the result list
            result.append(element)
    
    # Return the result list containing elements not in list2
    return result

   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each element in the first list
    for element in list1:
        # Check if the element is not in the second list
        if element not in list2:
            # If not, append it to the result list
            result.append(element)
    
    # Return the result list containing elements not in list2
    return result
```

This solution iterates over each element in `list1` and checks if it is not present in `list2`. If the element is not found in `list2`, it is added to the `result` list, which is returned at the end. This approach ensures that all elements from `list1` that are not in `list2` are included in the output list.
