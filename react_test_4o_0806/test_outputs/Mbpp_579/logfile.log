INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/579 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple containing the elements that are not common to both tuples. In other words, we need to find the elements that are present in one tuple but not in the other.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Convert both tuples into sets. This will allow us to easily find the unique elements in each tuple.
2. Use set operations to find the elements that are in the first set but not in the second, and vice versa.
3. Combine these two sets of unique elements.
4. Convert the combined set back into a tuple, as the final result should be a tuple.

## Pseudocode

1. Convert the first tuple to a set, `set1`.
2. Convert the second tuple to a set, `set2`.
3. Find the difference between `set1` and `set2`, call it `unique_in_first`.
4. Find the difference between `set2` and `set1`, call it `unique_in_second`.
5. Combine `unique_in_first` and `unique_in_second` into a single set, `dissimilar_elements`.
6. Convert `dissimilar_elements` to a tuple and return it.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_dissimilar(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Convert tuples to sets
    set1 = set(tuple1)
    set2 = set(tuple2)

    unique_in_second = set2 - set1

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/579 [generation text] ## Analysis of the Issue

The code is functionally correct in terms of finding the dissimilar elements between the two tuples. However, the issue arises with the order of the elements in the resulting tuple. The test expects the elements to be in a specific order, but the current implementation returns them in an arbitrary order because sets do not maintain any order.

## Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Order of Elements**: The solution uses sets to find dissimilar elements, which inherently do not maintain any order. When converting the set back to a tuple, the order of elements is not guaranteed, leading to a mismatch with the expected output.

2. **Expected Output Order**: The expected output order is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, but the test case suggests that the order should be based on the order of appearance in the original tuples.

## Revised Solution Approach

To address the order issue, we need to ensure that the elements in the resulting tuple are ordered based on their first appearance in the original tuples. Here's how we can achieve that:

1. **Identify Dissimilar Elements**: Use the same set operations to find elements that are unique to each tuple.
2. **Order the Elements**: Create a list to store the dissimilar elements in the order they first appear in the original tuples.
3. **Return as Tuple**: Convert the ordered list to a tuple and return it.

## Revised Python Solution

```python
def find_dissimilar(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Convert tuples to sets
    set1 = set(tuple1)
    set2 = set(tuple2)
    
    # Find elements unique to each set
    unique_in_first = set1 - set2
    unique_in_second = set2 - set1
    
    # Create a list to maintain order based on first appearance
    dissimilar_elements = []
    
    # Add unique elements from the first tuple in order
    for element in tuple1:
        if element in unique_in_first:
            dissimilar_elements.append(element)
    
    # Add unique elements from the second tuple in order
    for element in tuple2:
        if element in unique_in_second:
            dissimilar_elements.append(element)
    
    # Convert the list to a tuple and return
    return tuple(dissimilar_elements)
