INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/792 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/792 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the number of lists contained within it.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

The task is straightforward: we need to count how many lists are present in the given list. Since the input is a list of lists, we can simply return the length of the outer list, which will give us the number of inner lists.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

1. Define a function named `count_list` that takes one parameter, `list_of_lists`.
2. Use the `len()` function to determine the number of elements in `list_of_lists`.
3. Return the result from step 2.

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def count_list(list_of_lists: list) -> int:
    # Use the len() function to count the number of lists in the input list
    return len(list_of_lists)
```

This function will correctly count and return the number of lists in the provided list of lists.
INFO - program_code:
 
def count_list(list_of_lists: list) -> int:
    # Use the len() function to count the number of lists in the input list
