    "raw_msg": "Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.\n\n### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the number of lists contained within it.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nThe task is straightforward: we need to count how many lists are present in the given list. Since the input is a list of lists, we can simply return the length of the outer list, which will give us the number of inner lists.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n1. Define a function named `count_list` that takes one parameter, `list_of_lists`.\n2. Use the `len()` function to determine the number of elements in `list_of_lists`.\n3. Return the result from step 2.\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef count_list(list_of_lists: list) -> int:\n    # Use the len() function to count the number of lists in the input list\n    return len(list_of_lists)\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count and return the number of lists in the provided list of lists.",
