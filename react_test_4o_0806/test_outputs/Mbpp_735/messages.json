        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes an integer as input and toggles all the bits of its binary representation except for the first and last bits. Toggling a bit means changing a 0 to a 1 and a 1 to a 0.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Convert the integer to its binary representation.\n2. Identify the first and last bits, which should remain unchanged.\n3. Toggle all the bits between the first and last bits.\n4. Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer.\n5. Return the resulting integer.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Convert the input number to its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix.\n2. If the binary representation has less than 3 bits, return the number as is because there are no middle bits to toggle.\n3. Extract the first and last bits.\n4. Toggle the middle bits by iterating over them and changing each '0' to '1' and each '1' to '0'.\n5. Concatenate the first bit, the toggled middle bits, and the last bit to form the new binary string.\n6. Convert the new binary string back to an integer.\n7. Return the integer.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef toggle_middle_bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # Convert the number to a binary string without the '0b' prefix\n    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]\n    \n    # If the binary representation has less than 3 bits, return the number as is\n    if len(binary_str) < 3:\n        return n\n    \n    # Extract the first and last bits\n    first_bit = binary_str[0]\n    last_bit = binary_str[-1]\n    \n    # Toggle the middle bits\n    middle_bits = binary_str[1:-1]\n    toggled_middle_bits = ''.join('1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in middle_bits)\n    \n    # Form the new binary string\n    new_binary_str = first_bit + toggled_middle_bits + last_bit\n    \n    # Convert the new binary string back to an integer\n    result = int(new_binary_str, 2)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and should correctly toggle the middle bits of the binary representation of the input number."
