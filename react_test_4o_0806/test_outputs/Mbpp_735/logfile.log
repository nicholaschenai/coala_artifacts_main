You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/735 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and toggles all the bits of its binary representation except for the first and last bits. Toggling a bit means changing a 0 to a 1 and a 1 to a 0.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Convert the integer to its binary representation.
2. Identify the first and last bits, which should remain unchanged.
3. Toggle all the bits between the first and last bits.
4. Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer.
5. Return the resulting integer.

## Pseudocode

1. Convert the input number to its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix.
2. If the binary representation has less than 3 bits, return the number as is because there are no middle bits to toggle.
3. Extract the first and last bits.
4. Toggle the middle bits by iterating over them and changing each '0' to '1' and each '1' to '0'.
5. Concatenate the first bit, the toggled middle bits, and the last bit to form the new binary string.
6. Convert the new binary string back to an integer.
7. Return the integer.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def toggle_middle_bits(n: int) -> int:
    # Convert the number to a binary string without the '0b' prefix
    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # If the binary representation has less than 3 bits, return the number as is
    if len(binary_str) < 3:
        return n
    
    # Extract the first and last bits
    first_bit = binary_str[0]
    last_bit = binary_str[-1]
    
    # Toggle the middle bits
    middle_bits = binary_str[1:-1]
    toggled_middle_bits = ''.join('1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in middle_bits)
    
    # Form the new binary string
    new_binary_str = first_bit + toggled_middle_bits + last_bit
    
    # Convert the new binary string back to an integer
    result = int(new_binary_str, 2)
    
    return result
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and should correctly toggle the middle bits of the binary representation of the input number.
