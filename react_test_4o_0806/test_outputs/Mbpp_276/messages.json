The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \\( V = \\pi \\times r^2 \\times h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: \\( V = \\pi \\times r^2 \\times h \\).\n   - Calculate the square of the radius.\n   - Multiply the squared radius by the height.\n   - Multiply the result by \\( \\pi \\) to get the volume.\n   - Return the calculated volume.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function volume_cylinder with parameters radius and height\n       Calculate the square of the radius\n       Calculate the volume using the formula: \u03c0 * (radius squared) * height\n       Return the calculated volume\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef volume_cylinder(radius: float, height: float) -> float:\n    # Import the math module to access the value of \u03c0 (pi)\n    import math\n    \n    # Calculate the square of the radius\n    radius_squared = radius ** 2\n    \n    # Calculate the volume using the formula: \u03c0 * (radius squared) * height\n    volume = math.pi * radius_squared * height\n    \n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the volume of a cylinder using the given radius and height, utilizing the mathematical constant \u03c0 from the `math` module."
