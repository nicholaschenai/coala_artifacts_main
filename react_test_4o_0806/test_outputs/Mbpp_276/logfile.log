You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/276 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \( V = \pi \times r^2 \times h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: \( V = \pi \times r^2 \times h \).
   - Calculate the square of the radius.
   - Multiply the squared radius by the height.
   - Multiply the result by \( \pi \) to get the volume.
   - Return the calculated volume.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function volume_cylinder with parameters radius and height
       Calculate the square of the radius
       Calculate the volume using the formula: Ï€ * (radius squared) * height
       Return the calculated volume
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def volume_cylinder(radius: float, height: float) -> float:
    # Import the math module to access the value of Ï€ (pi)
    import math
    
    # Calculate the square of the radius
    radius_squared = radius ** 2
    
    # Calculate the volume using the formula: Ï€ * (radius squared) * height
    volume = math.pi * radius_squared * height
    
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
```

This function will correctly compute the volume of a cylinder using the given radius and height, utilizing the mathematical constant Ï€ from the `math` module.
