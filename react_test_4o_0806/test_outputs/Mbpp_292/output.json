    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient of the first number divided by the second number, rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will use integer division to find the quotient of two numbers. In Python, the `//` operator performs integer division, which divides two numbers and rounds down the result to the nearest integer. This operator will give us the desired result directly.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `find` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n   - Use the `//` operator to divide `a` by `b` and store the result.\n   - Return the result.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Use integer division to find the quotient of a divided by b\n    # The // operator will automatically round down to the nearest integer\n    result = a // b\n    # Return the result\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the quotient of two numbers, rounded down to the nearest integer, as required by the problem statement.",
