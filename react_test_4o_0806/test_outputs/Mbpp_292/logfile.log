You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to find quotient of two numbers (rounded down to the nearest integer).
assert find(10,3) == 3

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/292 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient of the first number divided by the second number, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will use integer division to find the quotient of two numbers. In Python, the `//` operator performs integer division, which divides two numbers and rounds down the result to the nearest integer. This operator will give us the desired result directly.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `find` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
   - Use the `//` operator to divide `a` by `b` and store the result.
   - Return the result.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Use integer division to find the quotient of a divided by b
    # The // operator will automatically round down to the nearest integer
    result = a // b
    # Return the result
    return result
```

This function will correctly compute the quotient of two numbers, rounded down to the nearest integer, as required by the problem statement.

    # Return the result
