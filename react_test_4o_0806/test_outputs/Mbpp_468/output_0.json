    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum product that can be formed by multiplying numbers from an increasing subsequence of a given list of integers. An increasing subsequence is a sequence where each number is greater than the previous one.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We'll maintain an array `max_product` where `max_product[i]` will store the maximum product of an increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. We'll iterate through the list, and for each element, we'll check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we'll update the `max_product[i]` with the maximum product possible by including the current element. Finally, the result will be the maximum value in the `max_product` array.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_product(arr):\n       if arr is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       n = length of arr\n       max_product = array of size n initialized with arr values\n       \n       for i from 1 to n-1:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   max_product[i] = max(max_product[i], max_product[j] * arr[i])\n       \n       return maximum value in max_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    # If the array is empty, return 0 as there is no subsequence\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    n = len(arr)\n    # Initialize max_product array with the values of arr itself\n    max_product = arr[:]\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the array starting from the second element\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                # Update max_product[i] with the maximum product possible by including arr[i]\n                max_product[i] = max(max_product[i], max_product[j] * arr[i])\n    \n    # Return the maximum value found in max_product array\n    return max(max_product)\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence in the given list.",
