    "raw_msg": "The previous attempts did not correctly address the problem because they focused on maximizing the product of any increasing subsequence without considering the specific subsequence that yields the maximum product. Let's correct this by ensuring we are correctly identifying and calculating the maximum product of an increasing subsequence.\n\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    # If the array is empty, return 0 as there is no subsequence\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    n = len(arr)\n    # Initialize max_product array with the values of arr itself\n    max_product = arr[:]\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the array starting from the second element\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                # Update max_product[i] with the maximum product possible by including arr[i]\n                max_product[i] = max(max_product[i], max_product[j] * arr[i])\n    \n    # Return the maximum value found in max_product array\n    return max(max_product)\n```\n\nThis solution should correctly calculate the maximum product of an increasing subsequence by iterating through the array and updating the `max_product` array based on valid increasing subsequences.",
