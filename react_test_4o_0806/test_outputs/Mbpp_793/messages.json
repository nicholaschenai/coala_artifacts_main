If the target element is not present in the list, the function should return -1.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Since the list is sorted, we can efficiently find the last occurrence of the target element by iterating through the list from the end to the beginning.\n   - Start from the last element of the list and move backwards.\n   - As soon as we find the target element, return its index.\n   - If we reach the beginning of the list without finding the target, return -1.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function last(sorted_list, target):\n       for index from length of sorted_list - 1 down to 0:\n           if sorted_list[index] is equal to target:\n               return index\n       return -1\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef last(sorted_list, target):\n    # Iterate over the list from the last element to the first\n    for index in range(len(sorted_list) - 1, -1, -1):\n        # Check if the current element is the target\n        if sorted_list[index] == target:\n            # Return the index if the target is found\n            return index\n    # Return -1 if the target is not found in the list\n    return -1\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the last occurrence of the target element in a sorted list by iterating from the end to the beginning, ensuring that we return the last index where the target appears. If the target is not found, it returns -1."
