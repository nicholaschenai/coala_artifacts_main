You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/793 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a sorted list and a target element as inputs and returns the last index where the target element appears in the list. If the target element is not present in the list, the function should return -1.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Since the list is sorted, we can efficiently find the last occurrence of the target element by iterating through the list from the end to the beginning.
   - Start from the last element of the list and move backwards.
   - As soon as we find the target element, return its index.
   - If we reach the beginning of the list without finding the target, return -1.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function last(sorted_list, target):
       for index from length of sorted_list - 1 down to 0:
           if sorted_list[index] is equal to target:
               return index
       return -1
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def last(sorted_list, target):
    # Iterate over the list from the last element to the first
    for index in range(len(sorted_list) - 1, -1, -1):
        # Check if the current element is the target
        if sorted_list[index] == target:
            # Return the index if the target is found
            return index
    # Return -1 if the target is not found in the list
    return -1
```

This solution efficiently finds the last occurrence of the target element in a sorted list by iterating from the end to the beginning, ensuring that we return the last index where the target appears. If the target is not found, it returns -1.

            return index
    # Return -1 if the target is not found in the list
    return -1
```

This solution efficiently finds the last occurrence of the target element in a sorted list by iterating from the end to the beginning, ensuring that we return the last index where the target appears. If the target is not found, it returns -1.
