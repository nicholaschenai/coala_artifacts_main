If all numbers at even indices are even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Iterate over the list, but only consider elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).\n2. For each element at an even index, check if it is an even number.\n3. If any element at an even index is not even, return `False`.\n4. If all elements at even indices are even, return `True`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction even_position(lst):\n    for each index i in range from 0 to length of lst with step 2:\n        if lst[i] is not even:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef even_position(lst):\n    # Iterate over the list with a step of 2 to check only even indices\n    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):\n        # Check if the element at the current even index is not even\n        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    # If all elements at even indices are even, return True\n    return True\n```"
