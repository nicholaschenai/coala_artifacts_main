You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/790 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if every number at an even index in a given list is an even number. If all numbers at even indices are even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate over the list, but only consider elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
2. For each element at an even index, check if it is an even number.
3. If any element at an even index is not even, return `False`.
4. If all elements at even indices are even, return `True`.

## Pseudocode

```
function even_position(lst):
    for each index i in range from 0 to length of lst with step 2:
        if lst[i] is not even:
            return False
    return True
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def even_position(lst):
    # Iterate over the list with a step of 2 to check only even indices
    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):
        # Check if the element at the current even index is not even
        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:
            return False
    # If all elements at even indices are even, return True
    return True
```
