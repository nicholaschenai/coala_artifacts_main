        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function `power_base_sum` that takes two arguments: `base` and `power`. The function should compute the result of raising `base` to the `power`, and then return the sum of all the digits in this result.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Calculate the Power**: First, compute the result of raising `base` to the `power`.\n2. **Convert to String**: Convert the resulting number to a string so that we can easily iterate over each digit.\n3. **Sum the Digits**: Convert each character back to an integer and sum them up.\n4. **Return the Sum**: Return the computed sum of the digits.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction power_base_sum(base, power):\n    result = base raised to the power\n    convert result to string\n    initialize sum_of_digits to 0\n    for each character in the string representation of result:\n        convert character to integer\n        add integer to sum_of_digits\n    return sum_of_digits\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef power_base_sum(base: int, power: int) -> int:\n    # Step 1: Calculate the power\n    result = base ** power\n    \n    # Step 2: Convert the result to a string\n    result_str = str(result)\n    \n    # Step 3: Initialize the sum of digits\n    sum_of_digits = 0\n    \n    # Step 4: Sum the digits\n    for char in result_str:\n        sum_of_digits += int(char)\n    \n    # Step 5: Return the sum of the digits\n    return sum_of_digits\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the sum of the digits of `base` raised to the `power`, as required by the problem statement."
