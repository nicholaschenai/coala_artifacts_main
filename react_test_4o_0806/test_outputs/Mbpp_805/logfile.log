You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/805 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input. Each inner list contains numbers. The function should return the inner list that has the highest sum of its elements.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the list with the maximum sum found so far.
   - Iterate over each list in the list of lists.
   - For each list, calculate the sum of its elements.
   - If the sum of the current list is greater than the sum of the list stored in the variable, update the variable to the current list.
   - After checking all lists, return the list stored in the variable.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_sum_list(list_of_lists):
       max_list = None
       max_sum = -infinity
       
       for each list in list_of_lists:
           current_sum = sum of elements in list
           if current_sum > max_sum:
               max_sum = current_sum
               max_list = list
       
       return max_list
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def max_sum_list(list_of_lists):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the list with the maximum sum
    max_list = None
    max_sum = float('-inf')  # Start with the smallest possible number
    
    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        # Calculate the sum of the current list
        current_sum = sum(lst)
        
        # If the current sum is greater than the max sum found so far
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            # Update the max sum and the list with the max sum
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = lst
    
    # Return the list with the maximum sum
    return max_list
```

This code will correctly identify and return the list with the highest sum from a list of lists.
