    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input. Each inner list contains numbers. The function should return the inner list that has the highest sum of its elements.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the list with the maximum sum found so far.\n   - Iterate over each list in the list of lists.\n   - For each list, calculate the sum of its elements.\n   - If the sum of the current list is greater than the sum of the list stored in the variable, update the variable to the current list.\n   - After checking all lists, return the list stored in the variable.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function max_sum_list(list_of_lists):\n       max_list = None\n       max_sum = -infinity\n       \n       for each list in list_of_lists:\n           current_sum = sum of elements in list\n           if current_sum > max_sum:\n               max_sum = current_sum\n               max_list = list\n       \n       return max_list\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_sum_list(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the list with the maximum sum\n    max_list = None\n    max_sum = float('-inf')  # Start with the smallest possible number\n    \n    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        # Calculate the sum of the current list\n        current_sum = sum(lst)\n        \n        # If the current sum is greater than the max sum found so far\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            # Update the max sum and the list with the max sum\n            max_sum = current_sum\n            max_list = lst\n    \n    # Return the list with the maximum sum\n    return max_list\n```\n\nThis code will correctly identify and return the list with the highest sum from a list of lists.",
