Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a string and two characters as input. The function should replace all occurrences of the second character in the string with the third character and return the modified string.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the built-in string method `replace()`. This method allows us to replace all occurrences of a specified substring with another substring. In this case, we will replace all occurrences of the second character with the third character in the given string.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n1. Define a function named `replace_char` that takes three parameters: `s` (the original string), `old_char` (the character to be replaced), and `new_char` (the character to replace with).\n2. Use the `replace()` method on the string `s` to replace all occurrences of `old_char` with `new_char`.\n3. Return the modified string.\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef replace_char(s: str, old_char: str, new_char: str) -> str:\n    # Use the replace method to replace all occurrences of old_char with new_char\n    modified_string = s.replace(old_char, new_char)\n    # Return the modified string\n    return modified_string\n```\n\nThis function will take a string and two characters as input, replace all occurrences of the second character with the third character in the string, and return the modified string."
