You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/474 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to create a function that takes a string and two characters as input. The function should replace all occurrences of the second character in the string with the third character and return the modified string.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can use the built-in string method `replace()`. This method allows us to replace all occurrences of a specified substring with another substring. In this case, we will replace all occurrences of the second character with the third character in the given string.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

1. Define a function named `replace_char` that takes three parameters: `s` (the original string), `old_char` (the character to be replaced), and `new_char` (the character to replace with).
2. Use the `replace()` method on the string `s` to replace all occurrences of `old_char` with `new_char`.
3. Return the modified string.

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def replace_char(s: str, old_char: str, new_char: str) -> str:
    # Use the replace method to replace all occurrences of old_char with new_char
    modified_string = s.replace(old_char, new_char)
    # Return the modified string
    return modified_string
```

This function will take a string and two characters as input, replace all occurrences of the second character with the third character in the string, and return the modified string.
INFO - program_code:
 
def replace_char(s: str, old_char: str, new_char: str) -> str:

    modified_string = s.replace(old_char, new_char)
    # Return the modified string
    return modified_string

    # Return the modified string
    return modified_string
