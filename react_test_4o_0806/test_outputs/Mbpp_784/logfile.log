You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/784 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and finds the product of the first even number and the first odd number in the list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the First Odd and Even Numbers**: Traverse the list from the beginning. Keep track of the first even number and the first odd number encountered.
2. **Calculate the Product**: Once both the first even and the first odd numbers are found, calculate their product.
3. **Return the Product**: Return the product as the result.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize two variables, `first_even` and `first_odd`, to `None`.
2. Loop through each number in the list:
   - If `first_even` is `None` and the number is even, set `first_even` to this number.
   - If `first_odd` is `None` and the number is odd, set `first_odd` to this number.
   - If both `first_even` and `first_odd` are not `None`, break the loop.
3. Calculate the product of `first_even` and `first_odd`.
4. Return the product.

### Python Code

```python
def mul_even_odd(lst):
    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers
    first_even = None
    first_odd = None
    
    # Iterate over the list to find the first even and odd numbers
    for num in lst:
        # Check if the number is even and first_even is not yet set
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        # Check if the number is odd and first_odd is not yet set
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        # If both first_even and first_odd are found, break the loop
        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:
            break
    
    # Calculate and return the product of the first even and odd numbers
    return first_even * first_odd
```

This code will correctly find the first even and odd numbers in the list and return their product, as required by the problem statement.
