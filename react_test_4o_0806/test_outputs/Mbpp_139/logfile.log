You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The function should return a floating-point number that is close to the expected value when the radius is 10.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula: \( C = 2 \times \pi \times r \), where \( C \) is the circumference and \( r \) is the radius of the circle. We will use the value of \( \pi \) as 3.14159 for our calculations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `circle_circumference` that takes one parameter `radius`.
   - Inside the function, set the value of \( \pi \) to 3.14159.
   - Calculate the circumference using the formula \( C = 2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \).
   - Return the calculated circumference.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def circle_circumference(radius: float) -> float:
    # Define the value of pi
    pi = 3.14159
    # Calculate the circumference using the formula C = 2 * pi * radius
    circumference = 2 * pi * radius
    # Return the calculated circumference
    return circumference
```

This function will compute the circumference of a circle using the given radius and the constant value of \( \pi \).
