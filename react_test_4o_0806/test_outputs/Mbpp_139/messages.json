The function should return a floating-point number that is close to the expected value when the radius is 10.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula: \\( C = 2 \\times \\pi \\times r \\), where \\( C \\) is the circumference and \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. We will use the value of \\( \\pi \\) as 3.14159 for our calculations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `circle_circumference` that takes one parameter `radius`.\n   - Inside the function, set the value of \\( \\pi \\) to 3.14159.\n   - Calculate the circumference using the formula \\( C = 2 \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius} \\).\n   - Return the calculated circumference.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef circle_circumference(radius: float) -> float:\n    # Define the value of pi\n    pi = 3.14159\n    # Calculate the circumference using the formula C = 2 * pi * radius\n    circumference = 2 * pi * radius\n    # Return the calculated circumference\n    return circumference\n```\n\nThis function will compute the circumference of a circle using the given radius and the constant value of \\( \\pi \\)."
