You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/227 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest of these three numbers.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare them using conditional statements. We can start by assuming the first number is the smallest, then compare it with the second and third numbers to update our assumption if we find a smaller number.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `min_of_three` that takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - Initialize a variable `min_value` with the value of `a`.
   - If `b` is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` to `b`.
   - If `c` is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` to `c`.
   - Return `min_value`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def min_of_three(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    # Start by assuming the first number is the smallest
    min_value = a
    
    # Compare with the second number
    if b < min_value:
        min_value = b
    
    # Compare with the third number
    if c < min_value:
        min_value = c
    
    # Return the smallest number found
    return min_value
```

This function will correctly return the smallest of the three input numbers by comparing them sequentially and updating the minimum value as needed.

    if b < min_value:
        min_value = b
    
    # Compare with the third number
    if c < min_value:
        min_value = c
