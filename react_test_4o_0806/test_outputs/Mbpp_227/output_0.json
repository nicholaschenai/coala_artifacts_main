    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest of these three numbers.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - To find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare them using conditional statements. We can start by assuming the first number is the smallest, then compare it with the second and third numbers to update our assumption if we find a smaller number.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `min_of_three` that takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n   - Initialize a variable `min_value` with the value of `a`.\n   - If `b` is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` to `b`.\n   - If `c` is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` to `c`.\n   - Return `min_value`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef min_of_three(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Start by assuming the first number is the smallest\n    min_value = a\n    \n    # Compare with the second number\n    if b < min_value:\n        min_value = b\n    \n    # Compare with the third number\n    if c < min_value:\n        min_value = c\n    \n    # Return the smallest number found\n    return min_value\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the smallest of the three input numbers by comparing them sequentially and updating the minimum value as needed.",
