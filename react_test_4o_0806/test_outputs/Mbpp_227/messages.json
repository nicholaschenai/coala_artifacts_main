We can start by assuming the first number is the smallest, then compare it with the second and third numbers to update our assumption if we find a smaller number.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `min_of_three` that takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n   - Initialize a variable `min_value` with the value of `a`.\n   - If `b` is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` to `b`.\n   - If `c` is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` to `c`.\n   - Return `min_value`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef min_of_three(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Start by assuming the first number is the smallest\n    min_value = a\n    \n    # Compare with the second number\n    if b < min_value:\n        min_value = b\n    \n    # Compare with the third number\n    if c < min_value:\n        min_value = c\n    \n    # Return the smallest number found\n    return min_value\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the smallest of the three input numbers by comparing them sequentially and updating the minimum value as needed."
