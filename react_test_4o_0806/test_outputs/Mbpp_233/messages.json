        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder given its height and radius. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is the area of the side surface, excluding the top and bottom circles.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   The lateral surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2 \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius} \\times \\text{height}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(\\pi\\) (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159. We will use Python's built-in constant for \\(\\pi\\) from the `math` module. The function will take two parameters: the radius and the height of the cylinder, and it will return the calculated lateral surface area.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Import the `math` module to access the constant \\(\\pi\\).\n   - Define a function `lateralsuface_cylinder` that takes two arguments: `height` and `radius`.\n   - Inside the function, calculate the lateral surface area using the formula: \\(2 \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius} \\times \\text{height}\\).\n   - Return the calculated lateral surface area.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef lateralsuface_cylinder(height: float, radius: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula: 2 * pi * radius * height\n    lateral_surface_area = 2 * math.pi * radius * height\n    # Return the calculated lateral surface area\n    return lateral_surface_area\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `lateralsuface_cylinder` which calculates and returns the lateral surface area of a cylinder using the given height and radius. The calculation uses the formula \\(2 \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius} \\times \\text{height}\\)."
