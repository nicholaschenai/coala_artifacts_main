INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/233 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder given its height and radius. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is the area of the side surface, excluding the top and bottom circles.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   The lateral surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Here, \(\pi\) (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159. We will use Python's built-in constant for \(\pi\) from the `math` module. The function will take two parameters: the radius and the height of the cylinder, and it will return the calculated lateral surface area.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Import the `math` module to access the constant \(\pi\).
   - Define a function `lateralsuface_cylinder` that takes two arguments: `height` and `radius`.
   - Inside the function, calculate the lateral surface area using the formula: \(2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \times \text{height}\).
   - Return the calculated lateral surface area.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
import math

def lateralsuface_cylinder(height: float, radius: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula: 2 * pi * radius * height
    lateral_surface_area = 2 * math.pi * radius * height
    # Return the calculated lateral surface area
    return lateral_surface_area
```

This code defines the function `lateralsuface_cylinder` which calculates and returns the lateral surface area of a cylinder using the given height and radius. The calculation uses the formula \(2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \times \text{height}\).
