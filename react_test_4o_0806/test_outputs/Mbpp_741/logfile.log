You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/741 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if all characters in a given string are the same. If all characters are identical, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - If the string is empty or has only one character, all characters are trivially the same, so return `True`.
   - For strings with more than one character, compare each character to the first character in the string.
   - If any character is different from the first character, return `False`.
   - If all characters are the same as the first character, return `True`.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function all_Characters_Same(s)
       If the length of s is 0 or 1
           Return True
       Set first_char to the first character of s
       For each character in s
           If character is not equal to first_char
               Return False
       Return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def all_Characters_Same(s: str) -> bool:
    # If the string is empty or has only one character, all characters are the same
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return True
    
    # Get the first character of the string
    first_char = s[0]
    
    # Check each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # If any character is different from the first character, return False
        if char != first_char:
