    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that checks if all characters in a given string are the same. If all characters are identical, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - If the string is empty or has only one character, all characters are trivially the same, so return `True`.\n   - For strings with more than one character, compare each character to the first character in the string.\n   - If any character is different from the first character, return `False`.\n   - If all characters are the same as the first character, return `True`.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function all_Characters_Same(s)\n       If the length of s is 0 or 1\n           Return True\n       Set first_char to the first character of s\n       For each character in s\n           If character is not equal to first_char\n               Return False\n       Return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(s: str) -> bool:\n    # If the string is empty or has only one character, all characters are the same\n    if len(s) <= 1:\n        return True\n    \n    # Get the first character of the string\n    first_char = s[0]\n    \n    # Check each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # If any character is different from the first character, return False\n        if char != first_char:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all characters are the same as the first character, return True\n    return True\n```",
