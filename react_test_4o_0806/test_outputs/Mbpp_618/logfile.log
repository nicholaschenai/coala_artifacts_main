You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/618 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers as input and returns a new list. This new list should contain the result of dividing each element of the first list by the corresponding element of the second list. The division should be done element-wise, meaning the first element of the first list is divided by the first element of the second list, the second element by the second, and so on. The result should be a list of floating-point numbers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure both lists have the same length, as element-wise operations require this.
2. **Element-wise Division**: Iterate over the elements of both lists simultaneously, dividing each element of the first list by the corresponding element of the second list.
3. **Result Storage**: Store the results of these divisions in a new list.
4. **Return the Result**: Return the list containing the division results.

### Pseudocode

```
function div_list(list1, list2):
    if length of list1 is not equal to length of list2:
        raise an error or handle the mismatch
    
    result = empty list
    for each index i from 0 to length of list1 - 1:
        divide list1[i] by list2[i] and store the result in result list
    
    return result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def div_list(list1, list2):
    # Check if both lists have the same length
    if len(list1) != len(list2):
        raise ValueError("Both lists must have the same length.")
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the elements of both lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Perform element-wise division and append the result to the result list
        result.append(list1[i] / list2[i])
    
    # Return the list of results
    return result
```

This solution ensures that the function performs element-wise division correctly and handles the case where the input lists are not of the same length by raising a `ValueError`. The division results are stored in a list and returned as floating-point numbers.
