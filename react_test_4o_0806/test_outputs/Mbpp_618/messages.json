        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers as input and returns a new list. This new list should contain the result of dividing each element of the first list by the corresponding element of the second list. The division should be done element-wise, meaning the first element of the first list is divided by the first element of the second list, the second element by the second, and so on. The result should be a list of floating-point numbers.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Ensure both lists have the same length, as element-wise operations require this.\n2. **Element-wise Division**: Iterate over the elements of both lists simultaneously, dividing each element of the first list by the corresponding element of the second list.\n3. **Result Storage**: Store the results of these divisions in a new list.\n4. **Return the Result**: Return the list containing the division results.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction div_list(list1, list2):\n    if length of list1 is not equal to length of list2:\n        raise an error or handle the mismatch\n    \n    result = empty list\n    for each index i from 0 to length of list1 - 1:\n        divide list1[i] by list2[i] and store the result in result list\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef div_list(list1, list2):\n    # Check if both lists have the same length\n    if len(list1) != len(list2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both lists must have the same length.\")\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the elements of both lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Perform element-wise division and append the result to the result list\n        result.append(list1[i] / list2[i])\n    \n    # Return the list of results\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution ensures that the function performs element-wise division correctly and handles the case where the input lists are not of the same length by raising a `ValueError`. The division results are stored in a list and returned as floating-point numbers."
