    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find elements that are common across three lists, but with a specific condition: the elements must appear at the same index in all three lists. The function should return a list of these common elements.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate through the indices of the lists.\n2. For each index, we will check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same.\n3. If they are the same, we will add that element to our result list.\n4. Finally, we will return the result list containing all such common elements.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n    initialize an empty list called common_elements\n    determine the minimum length of the three lists\n    for each index i from 0 to the minimum length - 1:\n        if the elements at index i in l1, l2, and l3 are the same:\n            add the element to common_elements\n    return common_elements\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store common elements\n    common_elements = []\n    \n    # Determine the minimum length of the three lists\n    min_length = min(len(l1), len(l2), len(l3))\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices up to the minimum length\n    for i in range(min_length):\n        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists\n        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:\n            # If they are the same, add the element to the common_elements list\n            common_elements.append(l1[i])\n    \n    # Return the list of common elements\n    return common_elements\n```",
