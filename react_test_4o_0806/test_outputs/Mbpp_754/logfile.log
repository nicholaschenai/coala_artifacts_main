You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/754 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find elements that are common across three lists, but with a specific condition: the elements must appear at the same index in all three lists. The function should return a list of these common elements.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through the indices of the lists.
2. For each index, we will check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same.
3. If they are the same, we will add that element to our result list.
4. Finally, we will return the result list containing all such common elements.

## Pseudocode

```
function extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    initialize an empty list called common_elements
    determine the minimum length of the three lists
    for each index i from 0 to the minimum length - 1:
        if the elements at index i in l1, l2, and l3 are the same:
            add the element to common_elements
    return common_elements
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    # Initialize an empty list to store common elements
    common_elements = []
    
    # Determine the minimum length of the three lists
    min_length = min(len(l1), len(l2), len(l3))
    
    # Iterate over the indices up to the minimum length
    for i in range(min_length):
        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists
        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:
            # If they are the same, add the element to the common_elements list
            common_elements.append(l1[i])
    
    # Return the list of common elements
    return common_elements
```
