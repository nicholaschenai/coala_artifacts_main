    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in that list.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Identify the largest number in the list.\n2. Identify the smallest number in the list.\n3. Calculate the difference between the largest and smallest numbers.\n4. Return this difference.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `big_diff` that takes a list `lst` as an argument.\n2. Find the maximum value in `lst` using the `max()` function.\n3. Find the minimum value in `lst` using the `min()` function.\n4. Calculate the difference by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.\n5. Return the calculated difference.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef big_diff(lst):\n    # Find the maximum value in the list\n    max_value = max(lst)\n    # Find the minimum value in the list\n    min_value = min(lst)\n    # Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values\n    difference = max_value - min_value\n    # Return the difference\n    return difference\n```",
