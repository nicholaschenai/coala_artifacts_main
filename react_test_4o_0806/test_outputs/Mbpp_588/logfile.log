You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/588 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in that list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Identify the largest number in the list.
2. Identify the smallest number in the list.
3. Calculate the difference between the largest and smallest numbers.
4. Return this difference.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `big_diff` that takes a list `lst` as an argument.
2. Find the maximum value in `lst` using the `max()` function.
3. Find the minimum value in `lst` using the `min()` function.
4. Calculate the difference by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.
5. Return the calculated difference.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def big_diff(lst):
    # Find the maximum value in the list
    max_value = max(lst)
    # Find the minimum value in the list
    min_value = min(lst)
    # Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values
    difference = max_value - min_value
    # Return the difference
    return difference
```

    # Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values
    difference = max_value - min_value
