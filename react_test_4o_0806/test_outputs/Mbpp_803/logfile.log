You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

We need to determine if a given integer is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 4 is a perfect square because it is 2 squared, and 9 is a perfect square because it is 3 squared.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Input and Output**: The function will take an integer as input and return a boolean value. The boolean will be `True` if the number is a perfect square and `False` otherwise.

2. **Determine if a Number is a Perfect Square**:
   - Calculate the integer square root of the number. This can be done by taking the square root of the number and converting it to an integer.
   - Square the integer square root and check if it equals the original number.
   - If it does, the number is a perfect square; otherwise, it is not.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_perfect_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    integer_sqrt = integer part of the square root of n
    if integer_sqrt * integer_sqrt == n:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:
    # Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares
    if n < 0:
        return False
    
    # Calculate the integer square root
    integer_sqrt = int(n ** 0.5)
    
    # Check if the square of the integer square root equals the original number
    return integer_sqrt * integer_sqrt == n
```

This solution checks if a number is a perfect square by comparing the square of its integer square root to the original number. If they are equal, the number is a perfect square.
