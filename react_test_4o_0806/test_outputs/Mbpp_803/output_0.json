    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if a given integer is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 4 is a perfect square because it is 2 squared, and 9 is a perfect square because it is 3 squared.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output**: The function will take an integer as input and return a boolean value. The boolean will be `True` if the number is a perfect square and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Determine if a Number is a Perfect Square**:\n   - Calculate the integer square root of the number. This can be done by taking the square root of the number and converting it to an integer.\n   - Square the integer square root and check if it equals the original number.\n   - If it does, the number is a perfect square; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction is_perfect_square(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    integer_sqrt = integer part of the square root of n\n    if integer_sqrt * integer_sqrt == n:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Calculate the integer square root\n    integer_sqrt = int(n ** 0.5)\n    \n    # Check if the square of the integer square root equals the original number\n    return integer_sqrt * integer_sqrt == n\n```\n\nThis solution checks if a number is a perfect square by comparing the square of its integer square root to the original number. If they are equal, the number is a perfect square.",
