The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary. The list should be sorted in descending order based on the values.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will take the input dictionary and convert it into a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair from the dictionary.\n   - We will then sort this list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (the value from the dictionary) in descending order.\n   - Finally, we will return the sorted list of tuples.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function sort_counter that takes a dictionary as input\n       Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples (key, value)\n       Sort the list of tuples by the second element (value) in descending order\n       Return the sorted list of tuples\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sort_counter(d: dict) -> list:\n    # Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples (key, value)\n    items = list(d.items())\n    \n    # Sort the list of tuples by the second element (value) in descending order\n    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n    \n    # Return the sorted list of tuples\n    return sorted_items\n```\n\nThis function, `sort_counter`, will take a dictionary as input, convert it to a list of tuples, sort the list by the values in descending order, and return the sorted list."
