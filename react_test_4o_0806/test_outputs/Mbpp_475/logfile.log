You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/475 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary as input, where the keys are strings and the values are integers. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary. The list should be sorted in descending order based on the values.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will take the input dictionary and convert it into a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair from the dictionary.
   - We will then sort this list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (the value from the dictionary) in descending order.
   - Finally, we will return the sorted list of tuples.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function sort_counter that takes a dictionary as input
       Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples (key, value)
       Sort the list of tuples by the second element (value) in descending order
       Return the sorted list of tuples
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sort_counter(d: dict) -> list:
    # Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples (key, value)
    items = list(d.items())
    
    # Sort the list of tuples by the second element (value) in descending order
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Return the sorted list of tuples
    return sorted_items
```

This function, `sort_counter`, will take a dictionary as input, convert it to a list of tuples, sort the list by the values in descending order, and return the sorted list.
