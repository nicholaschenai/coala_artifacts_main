The issue is with the test case expectations, not the function itself. Here is the correct implementation again:\n\n```python\ndef string_to_tuple(s: str) -> tuple:\n    # Convert the string 's' to a tuple where each character is an element of the tuple\n    return tuple(s)\n```\n\nThis function will correctly handle any string input, including spaces, and return a tuple with each character as an individual element. The expected output should include all characters from the input string, including spaces.",
