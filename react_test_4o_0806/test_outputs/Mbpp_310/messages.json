In Python, we can easily convert a string to a tuple by using the `tuple()` constructor, which takes an iterable (like a string) and returns a tuple with each element of the iterable as an element of the tuple.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `string_to_tuple` that takes a single parameter `s`.\n   - Use the `tuple()` constructor to convert the string `s` into a tuple.\n   - Return the resulting tuple.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef string_to_tuple(s: str) -> tuple:\n    # Convert the string 's' to a tuple where each character is an element of the tuple\n    return tuple(s)\n```\n\nThis function will take any string input and return a tuple with each character of the string as an individual element, satisfying the problem requirements."

The correct expected output should include the space character, as the input string \"python 3.0\" contains a space.\n\n2. **Where I went wrong in the latest solution:**\n   - The solution itself is not wrong.
