    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a tuple containing each character of the string as individual elements.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The task is straightforward: we need to convert a string into a tuple where each character of the string becomes an element of the tuple. In Python, we can easily convert a string to a tuple by using the `tuple()` constructor, which takes an iterable (like a string) and returns a tuple with each element of the iterable as an element of the tuple.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `string_to_tuple` that takes a single parameter `s`.\n   - Use the `tuple()` constructor to convert the string `s` into a tuple.\n   - Return the resulting tuple.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef string_to_tuple(s: str) -> tuple:\n    # Convert the string 's' to a tuple where each character is an element of the tuple\n    return tuple(s)\n```\n\nThis function will take any string input and return a tuple with each character of the string as an individual element, satisfying the problem requirements.",
