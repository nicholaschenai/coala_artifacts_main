If all three integers are the same, return 3.\n2. If only two of the integers are the same, return 2.\n3. If none of the integers are the same, return 0.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Check if all three integers are equal:\n   - If `a == b == c`, return 3.\n2. Check if any two integers are equal:\n   - If `a == b` or `b == c` or `a == c`, return 2.\n3. If none of the above conditions are met, return 0.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef test_three_equal(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Check if all three numbers are equal\n    if a == b == c:\n        return 3\n    # Check if any two numbers are equal\n    elif a == b or b == c or a == c:\n        return 2\n    # If none are equal\n    else:\n        return 0\n```"
