You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/801 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes three integers as input and returns the count of how many of these integers are equal to each other. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. If all three integers are the same, return 3.
2. If only two of the integers are the same, return 2.
3. If none of the integers are the same, return 0.

## Pseudocode

1. Check if all three integers are equal:
   - If `a == b == c`, return 3.
2. Check if any two integers are equal:
   - If `a == b` or `b == c` or `a == c`, return 2.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, return 0.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def test_three_equal(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    # Check if all three numbers are equal
    if a == b == c:
        return 3
    # Check if any two numbers are equal
    elif a == b or b == c or a == c:
        return 2
    # If none are equal
    else:
        return 0
```
