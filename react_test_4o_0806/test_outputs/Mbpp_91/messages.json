If the substring is found in at least one of the strings, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each string in the list.\n   - For each string, we will check if the given substring is present.\n   - If we find the substring in any string, we will immediately return `True`.\n   - If we finish checking all strings and do not find the substring, we will return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_substring(list_of_strings, substring):\n       for each string in list_of_strings:\n           if substring is in string:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_substring(list_of_strings, substring):\n    # Iterate over each string in the provided list\n    for string in list_of_strings:\n        # Check if the substring is present in the current string\n        if substring in string:\n            # If found, return True immediately\n            return True\n    # If the loop completes without finding the substring, return False\n    return False\n```"
