You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/91 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that checks if a given substring is present in any of the strings within a list. If the substring is found in at least one of the strings, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over each string in the list.
   - For each string, we will check if the given substring is present.
   - If we find the substring in any string, we will immediately return `True`.
   - If we finish checking all strings and do not find the substring, we will return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function find_substring(list_of_strings, substring):
       for each string in list_of_strings:
           if substring is in string:
               return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_substring(list_of_strings, substring):
    # Iterate over each string in the provided list
    for string in list_of_strings:
        # Check if the substring is present in the current string
        if substring in string:
            # If found, return True immediately
            return True
    # If the loop completes without finding the substring, return False
    return False
```
