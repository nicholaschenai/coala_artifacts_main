    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to write a function that takes two integers, `a` and `b`, and calculates `a` raised to the power of `b`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - To calculate `a` to the power of `b`, we can multiply `a` by itself `b` times. This is equivalent to using the exponentiation operation in Python, which is done using the `**` operator.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `power` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n   - Use the `**` operator to calculate `a` raised to the power of `b`.\n   - Return the result.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef power(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate a raised to the power of b using the ** operator\n    result = a ** b\n    # Return the result\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the power of `a` to `b` using Python's built-in exponentiation operator.",
