You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/93 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes two integers, `a` and `b`, and calculates `a` raised to the power of `b`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - To calculate `a` to the power of `b`, we can multiply `a` by itself `b` times. This is equivalent to using the exponentiation operation in Python, which is done using the `**` operator.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `power` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
   - Use the `**` operator to calculate `a` raised to the power of `b`.
   - Return the result.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def power(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Calculate a raised to the power of b using the ** operator
    result = a ** b
    # Return the result
    return result
```

This function will correctly compute the power of `a` to `b` using Python's built-in exponentiation operator.
INFO - program_code:
 
def power(a: int, b: int) -> int:
