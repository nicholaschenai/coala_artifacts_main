You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/643 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z', but not at the very beginning or the very end of the string. The function should return `True` if such a 'z' exists, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character. During this iteration, we check if any of these characters is 'z'. If we find a 'z' in this range, we return `True`. If we finish the iteration without finding a 'z', we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function text_match_wordz_middle with parameter s
       If the length of s is less than 3, return False
       For each character in s from the second to the second-to-last character
           If the character is 'z', return True
       Return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:
    # If the string is too short to have a middle 'z', return False
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Iterate over the string from the second character to the second-to-last character
    for i in range(1, len(s) - 1):
        # Check if the current character is 'z'
        if s[i] == 'z':
            return True
    
    # If no 'z' was found in the middle, return False
    return False
```
