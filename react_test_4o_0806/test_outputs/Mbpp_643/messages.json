The function should return `True` if such a 'z' exists, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character. During this iteration, we check if any of these characters is 'z'. If we find a 'z' in this range, we return `True`. If we finish the iteration without finding a 'z', we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function text_match_wordz_middle with parameter s\n       If the length of s is less than 3, return False\n       For each character in s from the second to the second-to-last character\n           If the character is 'z', return True\n       Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:\n    # If the string is too short to have a middle 'z', return False\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Iterate over the string from the second character to the second-to-last character\n    for i in range(1, len(s) - 1):\n        # Check if the current character is 'z'\n        if s[i] == 'z':\n            return True\n    \n    # If no 'z' was found in the middle, return False\n    return False\n```"
