        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function `is_samepatterns` that checks if two lists follow the same pattern. Specifically, the function should return `True` if the sequence of elements in the first list can be mapped to the sequence of elements in the second list in a one-to-one manner, and `False` otherwise.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Mapping Concept**: We need to establish a one-to-one mapping between elements of the first list and elements of the second list. This means each unique element in the first list should correspond to a unique element in the second list and vice versa.\n\n2. **Iterate and Map**: As we iterate through both lists simultaneously, we will maintain two dictionaries:\n   - `pattern_to_value`: Maps elements from the second list to elements in the first list.\n   - `value_to_pattern`: Maps elements from the first list to elements in the second list.\n\n3. **Check Consistency**: For each pair of elements from the two lists:\n   - If the element from the second list is already in `pattern_to_value`, check if it maps to the current element from the first list.\n   - If the element from the first list is already in `value_to_pattern`, check if it maps to the current element from the second list.\n   - If any of these checks fail, return `False`.\n\n4. **Return True**: If we can iterate through both lists without any mapping inconsistencies, return `True`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction is_samepatterns(values, patterns):\n    if length of values is not equal to length of patterns:\n        return False\n    \n    initialize pattern_to_value as an empty dictionary\n    initialize value_to_pattern as an empty dictionary\n    \n    for each pair (value, pattern) in zip(values, patterns):\n        if pattern in pattern_to_value:\n            if pattern_to_value[pattern] is not equal to value:\n                return False\n        else:\n            pattern_to_value[pattern] = value\n        \n        if value in value_to_pattern:\n            if value_to_pattern[value] is not equal to pattern:\n                return False\n        else:\n            value_to_pattern[value] = pattern\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_samepatterns(values, patterns):\n    # If the lengths of the lists are not equal, they cannot follow the same pattern\n    if len(values) != len(patterns):\n        return False\n    \n    # Dictionaries to store the mapping from patterns to values and vice versa\n    pattern_to_value = {}\n    value_to_pattern = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over both lists simultaneously\n    for value, pattern in zip(values, patterns):\n        # Check if the pattern is already mapped to a value\n        if pattern in pattern_to_value:\n            # If the current value does not match the mapped value, return False\n            if pattern_to_value[pattern] != value:\n                return False\n        else:\n            # Map the pattern to the current value\n            pattern_to_value[pattern] = value\n        \n        # Check if the value is already mapped to a pattern\n        if value in value_to_pattern:\n            # If the current pattern does not match the mapped pattern, return False\n            if value_to_pattern[value] != pattern:\n                return False\n        else:\n            # Map the value to the current pattern\n            value_to_pattern[value] = pattern\n    \n    # If all checks pass, the lists follow the same pattern\n    return True\n```"
