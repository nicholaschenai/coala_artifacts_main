You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/74 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function `is_samepatterns` that checks if two lists follow the same pattern. Specifically, the function should return `True` if the sequence of elements in the first list can be mapped to the sequence of elements in the second list in a one-to-one manner, and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Mapping Concept**: We need to establish a one-to-one mapping between elements of the first list and elements of the second list. This means each unique element in the first list should correspond to a unique element in the second list and vice versa.

2. **Iterate and Map**: As we iterate through both lists simultaneously, we will maintain two dictionaries:
   - `pattern_to_value`: Maps elements from the second list to elements in the first list.
   - `value_to_pattern`: Maps elements from the first list to elements in the second list.

3. **Check Consistency**: For each pair of elements from the two lists:
   - If the element from the second list is already in `pattern_to_value`, check if it maps to the current element from the first list.
   - If the element from the first list is already in `value_to_pattern`, check if it maps to the current element from the second list.
   - If any of these checks fail, return `False`.

4. **Return True**: If we can iterate through both lists without any mapping inconsistencies, return `True`.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_samepatterns(values, patterns):
    if length of values is not equal to length of patterns:
        return False
    
    initialize pattern_to_value as an empty dictionary
    initialize value_to_pattern as an empty dictionary
    
    for each pair (value, pattern) in zip(values, patterns):
        if pattern in pattern_to_value:
            if pattern_to_value[pattern] is not equal to value:
                return False
        else:
            pattern_to_value[pattern] = value
        
        if value in value_to_pattern:
            if value_to_pattern[value] is not equal to pattern:
                return False
        else:
            value_to_pattern[value] = pattern
    
    return True
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_samepatterns(values, patterns):
    # If the lengths of the lists are not equal, they cannot follow the same pattern
    if len(values) != len(patterns):
