You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/86 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the nth centered hexagonal number. A centered hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center in a hexagonal pattern. The task is to find the value of the nth centered hexagonal number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Centered hexagonal numbers can be calculated using a specific formula. The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the formula: \(3n(n-1) + 1\). This formula arises from the pattern of how dots are added to form the hexagonal shape. We will use this formula to compute the nth centered hexagonal number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `centered_hexagonal_number` that takes an integer `n` as input.
   - Use the formula \(3n(n-1) + 1\) to calculate the nth centered hexagonal number.
   - Return the result.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def centered_hexagonal_number(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula
    # Centered hexagonal number formula: 3n(n-1) + 1
    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1
```

This function will correctly compute the nth centered hexagonal number using the given formula.
