    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to write a function that calculates the nth centered hexagonal number. A centered hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center in a hexagonal pattern. The task is to find the value of the nth centered hexagonal number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Centered hexagonal numbers can be calculated using a specific formula. The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the formula: \\(3n(n-1) + 1\\). This formula arises from the pattern of how dots are added to form the hexagonal shape. We will use this formula to compute the nth centered hexagonal number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `centered_hexagonal_number` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n   - Use the formula \\(3n(n-1) + 1\\) to calculate the nth centered hexagonal number.\n   - Return the result.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula\n    # Centered hexagonal number formula: 3n(n-1) + 1\n    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the nth centered hexagonal number using the given formula.",
