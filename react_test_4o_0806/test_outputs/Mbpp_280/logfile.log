You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/280 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given element is present in a list. If the element is found, the function should return a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it should return a tuple with `False` and `-1`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Iterate through the list using a loop.
   - For each element in the list, check if it matches the target element.
   - If a match is found, return `True` and the current index.
   - If the loop completes without finding the element, return `False` and `-1`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sequential_search(array, element):
       for index from 0 to length of array - 1:
           if array[index] is equal to element:
               return (True, index)
       return (False, -1)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sequential_search(array, element):
    # Iterate over the array with index
    for index in range(len(array)):
        # Check if the current element matches the target element
        if array[index] == element:
            # If found, return True and the index
            return (True, index)
    # If not found, return False and -1
    return (False, -1)
```

This solution iterates through the list, checking each element against the target. If it finds the target, it returns `True` and the index. If it doesn't find the target, it returns `False` and `-1`.

    return (False, -1)
```
