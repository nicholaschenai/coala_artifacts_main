You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/116 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of positive integers and combines them into a single integer. For example, if the input is the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`, the output should be the integer `123`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can convert each integer in the tuple to a string, concatenate these strings together, and then convert the resulting string back to an integer. This will give us the desired single integer.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `tuple_to_int` that takes a tuple of integers as input.
   - Convert each integer in the tuple to a string.
   - Concatenate all the string representations together.
   - Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.
   - Return the resulting integer.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def tuple_to_int(t: tuple) -> int:
    # Convert each integer in the tuple to a string and join them together
    concatenated_string = ''.join(str(num) for num in t)
    # Convert the concatenated string back to an integer
    result_integer = int(concatenated_string)
    # Return the resulting integer
    return result_integer
```

This function will take a tuple of positive integers, convert each to a string, concatenate them, and then convert the concatenated string back to an integer, effectively combining the tuple elements into a single integer.

    result_integer = int(concatenated_string)
    # Return the resulting integer
