You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/259 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We are given two tuples, each containing multiple pairs of numbers. Our task is to create a new tuple where each pair is formed by taking the maximum of the corresponding elements from the pairs in the two input tuples.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

- We will iterate over the pairs of numbers from both tuples simultaneously.
- For each pair of numbers, we will compare the corresponding elements and select the maximum value for each position.
- We will construct a new tuple with these maximum values for each pair.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
Define a function maximize_elements that takes two tuples of tuples as input
    Initialize an empty list to store the result
    For each pair of tuples from the two input tuples (using zip to iterate simultaneously)
        For each element in the pair of tuples
            Find the maximum of the corresponding elements
        Create a new tuple with these maximum values
        Append this new tuple to the result list
    Convert the result list to a tuple
    Return the result tuple
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def maximize_elements(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over pairs of tuples from both input tuples
    for pair1, pair2 in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        # Find the maximum of the corresponding elements in the pairs
        max_pair = (max(pair1[0], pair2[0]), max(pair1[1], pair2[1]))
        
        # Append the new tuple with maximum values to the result list
        result.append(max_pair)
    
    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
```

This code will take two tuples of tuples as input, compare the corresponding elements, and return a new tuple of tuples with the maximum values for each pair.
