We will iterate through the list of numbers.\n2. We will keep track of the smallest number we have encountered so far.\n3. For each number in the list, we will compare it with the current smallest number.\n4. If the current number is smaller than the smallest number we have recorded, we will update our smallest number.\n5. After checking all numbers, we will return the smallest number found.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction smallest_num(numbers):\n    if the list is empty:\n        return None (or handle it as per requirement)\n    set smallest to the first element of the list\n    for each number in the list:\n        if number is less than smallest:\n            update smallest to be number\n    return smallest\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef smallest_num(numbers):\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        return None  # or raise an exception if empty lists are not allowed\n\n    # Initialize the smallest number with the first element of the list\n    smallest = numbers[0]\n\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # If the current number is smaller than the smallest recorded number\n        if number < smallest:\n            # Update the smallest number\n            smallest = number\n\n    # Return the smallest number found\n    return smallest\n```"
