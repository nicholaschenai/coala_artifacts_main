You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/62 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest number from that list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through the list of numbers.
2. We will keep track of the smallest number we have encountered so far.
3. For each number in the list, we will compare it with the current smallest number.
4. If the current number is smaller than the smallest number we have recorded, we will update our smallest number.
5. After checking all numbers, we will return the smallest number found.

## Pseudocode

```
function smallest_num(numbers):
    if the list is empty:
        return None (or handle it as per requirement)
    set smallest to the first element of the list
    for each number in the list:
        if number is less than smallest:
            update smallest to be number
    return smallest
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def smallest_num(numbers):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return None  # or raise an exception if empty lists are not allowed

    # Initialize the smallest number with the first element of the list
    smallest = numbers[0]

    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # If the current number is smaller than the smallest recorded number
        if number < smallest:
            # Update the smallest number
            smallest = number

    # Return the smallest number found
    return smallest
```
