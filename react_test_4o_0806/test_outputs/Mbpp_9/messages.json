        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of rotations required to transform a given string into itself. A rotation involves moving the first character of the string to the end. The task is to determine the smallest number of such rotations (greater than 0) that results in the original string.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Rotations**: A rotation of a string involves taking the first character and appending it to the end of the string. For example, rotating \"abcd\" once results in \"bcda\".\n\n2. **Identify the Pattern**: We need to find the smallest number of rotations that will result in the original string. For example, for the string \"aaaa\", rotating it any number of times will always result in \"aaaa\", so the answer is 1.\n\n3. **Iterate and Compare**: Start rotating the string one character at a time and compare the result with the original string. The first time the rotated string matches the original string, we have found the minimum number of rotations.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a variable `n` to the length of the string.\n2. Loop through the string from 1 to `n` (exclusive):\n   - Rotate the string by moving the first `i` characters to the end.\n   - If the rotated string matches the original string, return `i` as the number of rotations.\n3. If no match is found (which theoretically shouldn't happen), return `n`.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef find_Rotations(s: str) -> int:\n    n = len(s)\n    # Loop through possible rotations\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # Rotate the string by i positions\n        rotated = s[i:] + s[:i]\n        # Check if the rotated string matches the original\n        if rotated == s:\n            return i\n    # If no rotation matches, return the length of the string\n    return n\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find the minimum number of rotations required to return the string to its original form. The loop starts at 1 because we are looking for rotations greater than 0. The function returns the first `i` where the rotated string matches the original, which is the minimum number of rotations needed."
