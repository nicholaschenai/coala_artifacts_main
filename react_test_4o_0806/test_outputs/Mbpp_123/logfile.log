INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/123 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to a given number `n`. An amicable number is part of a pair of numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other. For example, 220 and 284 are an amicable pair because the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284, and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Proper Divisors**: For a given number, find all its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself).
2. **Sum of Divisors**: Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.
3. **Check Amicable Pair**: For each number up to `n`, check if it forms an amicable pair with another number.
4. **Sum Amicable Numbers**: If a number is part of an amicable pair, add it to the sum. Ensure each number is only counted once.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `sum_of_divisors(num)` that returns the sum of proper divisors of `num`.
2. Define the main function `amicable_numbers_sum(n)`:
   - Initialize a variable `amicable_sum` to 0.
   - Create a set `checked` to keep track of numbers already checked.
   - Loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n`:
     - If `i` is in `checked`, continue to the next iteration.
     - Calculate `sum_i` as the sum of divisors of `i`.
     - If `sum_i` is not equal to `i` and the sum of divisors of `sum_i` is `i`, then `i` and `sum_i` are an amicable pair.
     - Add both `i` and `sum_i` to `amicable_sum`.
     - Add both `i` and `sum_i` to `checked`.
   - Return `amicable_sum`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_of_divisors(num: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the sum of proper divisors of num
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            total += i
    return total

def amicable_numbers_sum(n: int) -> int:
    amicable_sum = 0
    checked = set()
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i in checked:
            continue
        
        sum_i = sum_of_divisors(i)
        
        if sum_i != i and sum_i <= n:
            sum_j = sum_of_divisors(sum_i)
            if sum_j == i:
                amicable_sum += i
                if sum_i <= n:
                    amicable_sum += sum_i
                checked.add(i)
                checked.add(sum_i)
    
    return amicable_sum
```

This code defines a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors and uses it to find and sum all amicable numbers up to `n`. The `checked` set ensures that each number is only considered once, preventing double-counting.
