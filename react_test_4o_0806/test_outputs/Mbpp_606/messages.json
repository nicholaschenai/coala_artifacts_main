        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to write a function that converts an angle given in degrees to radians. The function should take a single input, which is the angle in degrees, and return the equivalent angle in radians.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - To convert degrees to radians, we use the formula: radians = degrees \u00d7 (\u03c0 / 180). This formula is derived from the fact that 180 degrees is equivalent to \u03c0 radians. Therefore, to convert any degree value to radians, we multiply the degree value by \u03c0 and divide by 180.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `radian_degree` that takes one parameter `degrees`.\n   - Inside the function, calculate the radians using the formula: `radians = degrees * (\u03c0 / 180)`.\n   - Return the calculated radians.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef radian_degree(degrees: float) -> float:\n    # Define the value of \u03c0 (pi)\n    pi = 3.141592653589793\n    # Convert degrees to radians using the formula: radians = degrees * (\u03c0 / 180)\n    radians = degrees * (pi / 180)\n    # Return the calculated radians\n    return radians\n```\n\nThis function will correctly convert an angle from degrees to radians using the mathematical relationship between the two units."
