You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/606 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that converts an angle given in degrees to radians. The function should take a single input, which is the angle in degrees, and return the equivalent angle in radians.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To convert degrees to radians, we use the formula: radians = degrees Ã— (Ï€ / 180). This formula is derived from the fact that 180 degrees is equivalent to Ï€ radians. Therefore, to convert any degree value to radians, we multiply the degree value by Ï€ and divide by 180.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `radian_degree` that takes one parameter `degrees`.
   - Inside the function, calculate the radians using the formula: `radians = degrees * (Ï€ / 180)`.
   - Return the calculated radians.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def radian_degree(degrees: float) -> float:
    # Define the value of Ï€ (pi)
    pi = 3.141592653589793
    # Convert degrees to radians using the formula: radians = degrees * (Ï€ / 180)
    radians = degrees * (pi / 180)
    # Return the calculated radians
    return radians
```

This function will correctly convert an angle from degrees to radians using the mathematical relationship between the two units.
