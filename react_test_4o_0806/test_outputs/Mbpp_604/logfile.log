You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/604 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a string as input. This string contains words separated by spaces. The function should return a new string where the order of the words is reversed.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, we will split the input string into a list of words using spaces as the delimiter.
   - Then, we will reverse the order of the words in this list.
   - Finally, we will join the reversed list of words back into a single string with spaces in between each word and return this string.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `reverse_words` that takes a single parameter `s`.
   - Split the string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method.
   - Reverse the list of words.
   - Join the reversed list into a single string with spaces in between using the `join()` method.
   - Return the resulting string.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def reverse_words(s: str) -> str:
    # Split the input string into a list of words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Reverse the list of words
    reversed_words = words[::-1]
    
    # Join the reversed list of words into a single string with spaces
    reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)
    
    # Return the resulting reversed string
    return reversed_string
```

This function will take a string, split it into words, reverse the order of those words, and then join them back into a single string with spaces, effectively reversing the order of words in the original string.

    # Join the reversed list of words into a single string with spaces
    reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)
    
    # Return the resulting reversed string
    return reversed_string

    # Return the resulting reversed string
    return reversed_string
```
