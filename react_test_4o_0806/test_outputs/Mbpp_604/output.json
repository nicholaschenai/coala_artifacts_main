    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes a string as input. This string contains words separated by spaces. The function should return a new string where the order of the words is reversed.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, we will split the input string into a list of words using spaces as the delimiter.\n   - Then, we will reverse the order of the words in this list.\n   - Finally, we will join the reversed list of words back into a single string with spaces in between each word and return this string.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `reverse_words` that takes a single parameter `s`.\n   - Split the string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method.\n   - Reverse the list of words.\n   - Join the reversed list into a single string with spaces in between using the `join()` method.\n   - Return the resulting string.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s: str) -> str:\n    # Split the input string into a list of words\n    words = s.split()\n    \n    # Reverse the list of words\n    reversed_words = words[::-1]\n    \n    # Join the reversed list of words into a single string with spaces\n    reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)\n    \n    # Return the resulting reversed string\n    return reversed_string\n```\n\nThis function will take a string, split it into words, reverse the order of those words, and then join them back into a single string with spaces, effectively reversing the order of words in the original string.",
