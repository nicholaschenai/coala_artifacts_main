You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/12 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to write a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as input. Each list within the matrix represents a row. The function should sort the rows of the matrix based on the sum of the elements in each row, in ascending order.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
- For each row in the matrix, calculate the sum of its elements.
- Use these sums to sort the rows of the matrix.
- Return the matrix with its rows sorted by these sums.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function sort_matrix(matrix):
    sort the matrix by the sum of each row
    return the sorted matrix
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def sort_matrix(matrix):
    # Sort the matrix using the sum of each row as the key
    # The sorted function will sort the rows based on the sum of their elements
    sorted_matrix = sorted(matrix, key=sum)
    return sorted_matrix
```

This solution uses Python's built-in `sorted` function, which allows us to specify a `key` function. By setting `key=sum`, we ensure that the rows are sorted based on the sum of their elements. The `sorted` function returns a new list that is sorted, which we then return as the result.

def sort_matrix(matrix):

    return sorted_matrix
