        "content": "Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as input. Each list within the matrix represents a row. The function should sort the rows of the matrix based on the sum of the elements in each row, in ascending order.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n- For each row in the matrix, calculate the sum of its elements.\n- Use these sums to sort the rows of the matrix.\n- Return the matrix with its rows sorted by these sums.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction sort_matrix(matrix):\n    sort the matrix by the sum of each row\n    return the sorted matrix\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef sort_matrix(matrix):\n    # Sort the matrix using the sum of each row as the key\n    # The sorted function will sort the rows based on the sum of their elements\n    sorted_matrix = sorted(matrix, key=sum)\n    return sorted_matrix\n```\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `sorted` function, which allows us to specify a `key` function. By setting `key=sum`, we ensure that the rows are sorted based on the sum of their elements. The `sorted` function returns a new list that is sorted, which we then return as the result."
