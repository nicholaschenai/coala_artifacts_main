You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/17 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a square. The function will take the length of one side of the square as input and return the perimeter.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The perimeter of a square is calculated by adding up the lengths of all four sides. Since all sides of a square are equal, the perimeter can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `square_perimeter` that takes one parameter `side_length`.
   - Calculate the perimeter by multiplying `side_length` by 4.
   - Return the calculated perimeter.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
# Define the function to calculate the perimeter of a square
def square_perimeter(side_length: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 4
    perimeter = 4 * side_length
    # Return the calculated perimeter
    return perimeter
```

This function will correctly compute the perimeter of a square given the length of one of its sides.
