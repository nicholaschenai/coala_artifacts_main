    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a square. The function will take the length of one side of the square as input and return the perimeter.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The perimeter of a square is calculated by adding up the lengths of all four sides. Since all sides of a square are equal, the perimeter can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `square_perimeter` that takes one parameter `side_length`.\n   - Calculate the perimeter by multiplying `side_length` by 4.\n   - Return the calculated perimeter.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\n# Define the function to calculate the perimeter of a square\ndef square_perimeter(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 4\n    perimeter = 4 * side_length\n    # Return the calculated perimeter\n    return perimeter\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the perimeter of a square given the length of one of its sides.",
