You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/113 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that checks if a given string can be interpreted as an integer. If the string represents an integer, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Definition of an Integer String**: A string represents an integer if it consists solely of digits, possibly prefixed with a single '+' or '-' sign.
2. **Steps to Check**:
   - If the string is empty, it cannot represent an integer.
   - If the string starts with a '+' or '-', remove this sign for further checks.
   - After removing the sign (if any), check if the remaining part of the string consists only of digits.
   - If it does, the string represents an integer; otherwise, it does not.

### Pseudocode

```
function check_integer(s):
    if s is empty:
        return False
    if s starts with '+' or '-':
        remove the first character
    return True if the remaining string consists only of digits, else False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def check_integer(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the string is empty
    if not s:
        return False
    
    # Check if the string starts with '+' or '-'
    if s[0] in ('+', '-'):
        # Remove the sign for further checks
        s = s[1:]
    
    # Check if the remaining string consists only of digits
    return s.isdigit()
```

This function first checks if the string is empty, which cannot represent an integer. It then checks for a leading '+' or '-' and removes it if present. Finally, it checks if the remaining string consists only of digits using the `isdigit()` method, which returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, otherwise `False`.

    if s[0] in ('+', '-'):
        # Remove the sign for further checks
        s = s[1:]
    
    # Check if the remaining string consists only of digits
    return s.isdigit()
