        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that checks if a given string can be interpreted as an integer. If the string represents an integer, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Definition of an Integer String**: A string represents an integer if it consists solely of digits, possibly prefixed with a single '+' or '-' sign.\n2. **Steps to Check**:\n   - If the string is empty, it cannot represent an integer.\n   - If the string starts with a '+' or '-', remove this sign for further checks.\n   - After removing the sign (if any), check if the remaining part of the string consists only of digits.\n   - If it does, the string represents an integer; otherwise, it does not.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction check_integer(s):\n    if s is empty:\n        return False\n    if s starts with '+' or '-':\n        remove the first character\n    return True if the remaining string consists only of digits, else False\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_integer(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is empty\n    if not s:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the string starts with '+' or '-'\n    if s[0] in ('+', '-'):\n        # Remove the sign for further checks\n        s = s[1:]\n    \n    # Check if the remaining string consists only of digits\n    return s.isdigit()\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the string is empty, which cannot represent an integer. It then checks for a leading '+' or '-' and removes it if present. Finally, it checks if the remaining string consists only of digits using the `isdigit()` method, which returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, otherwise `False`."
