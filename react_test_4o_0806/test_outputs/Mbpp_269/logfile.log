INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/269 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/269 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

The task is to write a function that takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value. The ASCII value is a numerical representation of a character in the ASCII table.

## Conceptual Solution

1. The input to the function will be a single character string.
2. We need to find the ASCII value of this character.
3. In Python, the built-in function `ord()` can be used to get the ASCII value of a character.
4. The function will return the result of `ord()` applied to the input character.

## Pseudocode

```
function ascii_value(character):
    return ord(character)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def ascii_value(character: str) -> int:
    # Use the built-in ord() function to get the ASCII value of the character
    return ord(character)
```
INFO - program_code:
 
def ascii_value(character: str) -> int:
    # Use the built-in ord() function to get the ASCII value of the character
    return ord(character)
