The ASCII value is a numerical representation of a character in the ASCII table.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. The input to the function will be a single character string.\n2. We need to find the ASCII value of this character.\n3. In Python, the built-in function `ord()` can be used to get the ASCII value of a character.\n4. The function will return the result of `ord()` applied to the input character.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction ascii_value(character):\n    return ord(character)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef ascii_value(character: str) -> int:\n    # Use the built-in ord() function to get the ASCII value of the character\n    return ord(character)\n```"
