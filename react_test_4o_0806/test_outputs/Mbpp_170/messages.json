The function should return the sum of the numbers in the list that are within the range specified by these two indices, inclusive.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input**: A list of numbers and two indices.\n2. **Output**: The sum of the numbers in the list from the first index to the second index, inclusive.\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Use Python's list slicing to extract the sublist from the start index to the end index (inclusive).\n   - Use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the numbers in this sublist.\n   - Return the calculated sum.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction sum_range_list(numbers, start_index, end_index):\n    sublist = numbers[start_index:end_index + 1]\n    total_sum = sum(sublist)\n    return total_sum\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef sum_range_list(numbers: list, start_index: int, end_index: int) -> int:\n    # Extract the sublist from start_index to end_index (inclusive)\n    sublist = numbers[start_index:end_index + 1]\n    # Calculate the sum of the sublist\n    total_sum = sum(sublist)\n    # Return the sum\n    return total_sum\n```"
