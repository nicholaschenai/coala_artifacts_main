1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the nth Bell number. The Bell number is a sequence of numbers that represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. For example, the 2nd Bell number is 2, which means there are 2 ways to partition a set of 2 elements.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the nth Bell number, we can use a triangular array known as Bell's triangle. The first element of each row in Bell's triangle is the last element of the previous row. Each subsequent element in the row is the sum of the element to the left and the element above it. The nth Bell number is the first element of the nth row.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function bell_Number(n):
       Create a 2D list (triangle) with n+1 rows
       Initialize the first element of the triangle as 1
       
       For each row i from 1 to n:
           Set the first element of the row to the last element of the previous row
           For each column j from 1 to i:
               Set the current element to the sum of the element to the left and the element above
       
       Return the first element of the nth row
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def bell_Number(n: int) -> int:
    # Create a 2D list (triangle) with n+1 rows
    bell_triangle = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Initialize the first element of the triangle as 1
    bell_triangle[0][0] = 1
    
    # Fill the Bell triangle
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Set the first element of the current row to the last element of the previous row
        bell_triangle[i][0] = bell_triangle[i - 1][i - 1]
        
        # Fill the rest of the row
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            # Current element is the sum of the element to the left and the element above
            bell_triangle[i][j] = bell_triangle[i][j - 1] + bell_triangle[i - 1][j - 1]
    
    # Return the first element of the nth row, which is the nth Bell number
    return bell_triangle[n][0]
```

This code calculates the nth Bell number using Bell's triangle, which is a straightforward and efficient way to compute Bell numbers.
