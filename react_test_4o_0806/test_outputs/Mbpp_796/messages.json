The dictionary will have strings as keys and integers as values.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Extract all the values from the dictionary.\n2. Sum these values.\n3. Return the sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `return_sum` that takes a dictionary `d` as an argument.\n2. Use the `values()` method of the dictionary to get all the values.\n3. Use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of these values.\n4. Return the result.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef return_sum(d: dict) -> int:\n    # Get all the values from the dictionary\n    values = d.values()\n    # Calculate the sum of the values\n    total_sum = sum(values)\n    # Return the sum\n    return total_sum\n```"
