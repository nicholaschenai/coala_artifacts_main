You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write function to find the sum of all items in the given dictionary.
assert return_sum({'a': 100, 'b':200, 'c':300}) == 600

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/796 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function called `return_sum` that takes a dictionary as input and returns the sum of all its values. The dictionary will have strings as keys and integers as values.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Extract all the values from the dictionary.
2. Sum these values.
3. Return the sum.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `return_sum` that takes a dictionary `d` as an argument.
2. Use the `values()` method of the dictionary to get all the values.
3. Use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of these values.
4. Return the result.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def return_sum(d: dict) -> int:
    # Get all the values from the dictionary
    values = d.values()
    # Calculate the sum of the values
    total_sum = sum(values)
    # Return the sum
    return total_sum
```
INFO - program_code:

    # Calculate the sum of the values
    total_sum = sum(values)
    # Return the sum
    return total_sum
