You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where each character's case is toggled. This means that uppercase letters should be converted to lowercase, and lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each character in the input string.
   - For each character, we will check if it is uppercase or lowercase.
   - If the character is uppercase, we will convert it to lowercase.
   - If the character is lowercase, we will convert it to uppercase.
   - We will collect all the toggled characters and join them to form the final string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `toggle_string` that takes a single parameter `s`.
   - Initialize an empty list `toggled_chars` to store the toggled characters.
   - For each character `char` in the string `s`:
     - If `char` is uppercase, convert it to lowercase and add it to `toggled_chars`.
     - If `char` is lowercase, convert it to uppercase and add it to `toggled_chars`.
   - Join all characters in `toggled_chars` to form the final toggled string.
   - Return the final toggled string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def toggle_string(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the toggled characters
    toggled_chars = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is uppercase
        if char.isupper():
            # Convert to lowercase and add to the list
            toggled_chars.append(char.lower())
        # Check if the character is lowercase
        elif char.islower():
            # Convert to uppercase and add to the list
            toggled_chars.append(char.upper())
        else:
            # If it's neither, just add the character as is (for non-alphabetic characters)
            toggled_chars.append(char)
    
    # Join the list of characters into a single string
    toggled_string = ''.join(toggled_chars)
    
    # Return the final toggled string
    return toggled_string
```

This solution iterates over each character in the input string, toggles its case, and constructs a new string with the toggled characters. The function handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
