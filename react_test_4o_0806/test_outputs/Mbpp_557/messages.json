        "content": "\n## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where each character's case is toggled. This means that uppercase letters should be converted to lowercase, and lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate over each character in the input string.\n   - For each character, we will check if it is uppercase or lowercase.\n   - If the character is uppercase, we will convert it to lowercase.\n   - If the character is lowercase, we will convert it to uppercase.\n   - We will collect all the toggled characters and join them to form the final string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `toggle_string` that takes a single parameter `s`.\n   - Initialize an empty list `toggled_chars` to store the toggled characters.\n   - For each character `char` in the string `s`:\n     - If `char` is uppercase, convert it to lowercase and add it to `toggled_chars`.\n     - If `char` is lowercase, convert it to uppercase and add it to `toggled_chars`.\n   - Join all characters in `toggled_chars` to form the final toggled string.\n   - Return the final toggled string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef toggle_string(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the toggled characters\n    toggled_chars = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is uppercase\n        if char.isupper():\n            # Convert to lowercase and add to the list\n            toggled_chars.append(char.lower())\n        # Check if the character is lowercase\n        elif char.islower():\n            # Convert to uppercase and add to the list\n            toggled_chars.append(char.upper())\n        else:\n            # If it's neither, just add the character as is (for non-alphabetic characters)\n            toggled_chars.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list of characters into a single string\n    toggled_string = ''.join(toggled_chars)\n    \n    # Return the final toggled string\n    return toggled_string\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each character in the input string, toggles its case, and constructs a new string with the toggled characters. The function handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged."
