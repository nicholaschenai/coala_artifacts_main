The right insertion point is the index at which the value can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of the list. If the value is already present in the list, the insertion point should be after the last occurrence of that value.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We are given a sorted list and a value.\n2. We need to find the index where the value can be inserted such that the list remains sorted.\n3. If the value is already present in the list, we should find the position after the last occurrence of that value.\n4. We can iterate through the list and find the first position where the current element is greater than the given value. This position will be the right insertion point.\n5. If we reach the end of the list without finding such a position, the right insertion point is the length of the list.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction right_insertion(sorted_list, value):\n    for index from 0 to length of sorted_list - 1:\n        if sorted_list[index] > value:\n            return index\n    return length of sorted_list\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef right_insertion(sorted_list, value):\n    # Iterate through the list to find the right insertion point\n    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):\n        # If the current element is greater than the value, return the current index\n        if sorted_list[index] > value:\n            return index\n    # If no such element is found, return the length of the list\n    return len(sorted_list)\n```"
