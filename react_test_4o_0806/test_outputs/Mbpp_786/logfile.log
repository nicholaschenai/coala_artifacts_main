You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/786 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that finds the right insertion point for a given value in a sorted list. The right insertion point is the index at which the value can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of the list. If the value is already present in the list, the insertion point should be after the last occurrence of that value.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We are given a sorted list and a value.
2. We need to find the index where the value can be inserted such that the list remains sorted.
3. If the value is already present in the list, we should find the position after the last occurrence of that value.
4. We can iterate through the list and find the first position where the current element is greater than the given value. This position will be the right insertion point.
5. If we reach the end of the list without finding such a position, the right insertion point is the length of the list.

## Pseudocode

```
function right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    for index from 0 to length of sorted_list - 1:
        if sorted_list[index] > value:
            return index
    return length of sorted_list
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    # Iterate through the list to find the right insertion point
    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):
        # If the current element is greater than the value, return the current index
        if sorted_list[index] > value:
            return index
    # If no such element is found, return the length of the list
    return len(sorted_list)
```

        if sorted_list[index] > value:
