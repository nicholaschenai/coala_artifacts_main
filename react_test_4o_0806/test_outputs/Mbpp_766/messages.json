Each tuple should contain a pair of consecutive items from the input list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input list and for each element (except the last one), create a tuple with the current element and the next element. We will collect all these tuples in a new list and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named pair_wise that takes a list as input.\n   Initialize an empty list called result to store the pairs.\n   Loop through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element:\n       Create a tuple with the current element and the next element.\n       Append this tuple to the result list.\n   Return the result list.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef pair_wise(lst):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the pairs\n    result = []\n    \n    # Loop through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element\n    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):\n        # Create a tuple with the current element and the next element\n        pair = (lst[i], lst[i + 1])\n        \n        # Append this tuple to the result list\n        result.append(pair)\n    \n    # Return the result list containing all pairs\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will iterate through the list, create pairs of consecutive elements, and return a list of these pairs."
