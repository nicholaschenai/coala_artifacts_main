You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/766 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of items and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain a pair of consecutive items from the input list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input list and for each element (except the last one), create a tuple with the current element and the next element. We will collect all these tuples in a new list and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function named pair_wise that takes a list as input.
   Initialize an empty list called result to store the pairs.
   Loop through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element:
       Create a tuple with the current element and the next element.
       Append this tuple to the result list.
   Return the result list.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def pair_wise(lst):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the pairs
    result = []
    
    # Loop through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        # Create a tuple with the current element and the next element
        pair = (lst[i], lst[i + 1])
        
        # Append this tuple to the result list
        result.append(pair)
    
    # Return the result list containing all pairs
    return result
```

This function will iterate through the list, create pairs of consecutive elements, and return a list of these pairs.
