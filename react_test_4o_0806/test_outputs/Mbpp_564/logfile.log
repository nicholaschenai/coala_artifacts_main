You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/564 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and counts the number of unique unordered pairs where the two elements in each pair are different.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We need to find all possible pairs of elements in the list.
   - For each pair, check if the two elements are different.
   - Count the number of such pairs.
   - Since the pairs are unordered, a pair (a, b) is considered the same as (b, a), so we should only count one of them.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Initialize a counter to zero.
   - Loop through each element in the list using an index `i`.
     - For each element, loop through the subsequent elements using an index `j`.
       - If the element at index `i` is not equal to the element at index `j`, increment the counter.
   - Return the counter.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def count_Pairs(lst: list, n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize a counter for the number of valid pairs
    count = 0
    
    # Loop through each element in the list using index i
    for i in range(n):
        # Loop through each subsequent element using index j
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Check if the elements at index i and j are different
            if lst[i] != lst[j]:
                # Increment the counter if they are different
                count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of valid pairs
    return count
```

This solution iterates over all possible pairs of elements in the list and counts those pairs where the elements are different. The nested loop ensures that each pair is only considered once, maintaining the unordered nature of the pairs.

            # Check if the elements at index i and j are different
            if lst[i] != lst[j]:
                # Increment the counter if they are different
                count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of valid pairs
