INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/425 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to count the number of sublists containing a particular element.
assert count_element_in_list([[1, 3], [5, 7], [1, 11], [1, 15, 7]],1)==3

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/425 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a list of sublists and a particular element. The function should return the count of sublists that contain the specified element.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Initialize a counter to zero.
   - Iterate over each sublist in the main list.
   - For each sublist, check if the specified element is present.
   - If the element is found in the sublist, increment the counter by one.
   - After checking all sublists, return the counter as the result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_element_in_list(list_of_sublists, element):
       initialize counter to 0
       for each sublist in list_of_sublists:
           if element is in sublist:
               increment counter by 1
       return counter
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def count_element_in_list(list_of_sublists, element):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of sublists containing the element
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of sublists
    for sublist in list_of_sublists:
        # Check if the element is present in the current sublist
        if element in sublist:
            # Increment the counter if the element is found
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of sublists containing the element
    return count
```

This function will correctly count the number of sublists that contain the specified element, as required by the problem statement.
