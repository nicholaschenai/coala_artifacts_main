The function should return the count of sublists that contain the specified element.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - Iterate over each sublist in the main list.\n   - For each sublist, check if the specified element is present.\n   - If the element is found in the sublist, increment the counter by one.\n   - After checking all sublists, return the counter as the result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function count_element_in_list(list_of_sublists, element):\n       initialize counter to 0\n       for each sublist in list_of_sublists:\n           if element is in sublist:\n               increment counter by 1\n       return counter\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_element_in_list(list_of_sublists, element):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of sublists containing the element\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of sublists\n    for sublist in list_of_sublists:\n        # Check if the element is present in the current sublist\n        if element in sublist:\n            # Increment the counter if the element is found\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of sublists containing the element\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of sublists that contain the specified element, as required by the problem statement."
