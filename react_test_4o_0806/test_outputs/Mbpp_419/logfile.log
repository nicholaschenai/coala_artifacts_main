You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/419 [generation text] Sure, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The function should return this final result.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

- First, we will round each number in the list to the nearest integer.
- Next, we will calculate the sum of these rounded numbers.
- We will then determine the length of the list.
- Finally, we will multiply the sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the list and return the result.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function round_and_sum(numbers):
    initialize a variable rounded_sum to 0
    for each number in the list numbers:
        round the number to the nearest integer
        add the rounded number to rounded_sum
    calculate the length of the list numbers
    multiply rounded_sum by the length of the list
    return the result
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def round_and_sum(numbers):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of rounded numbers
    rounded_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Round the number to the nearest integer and add it to the sum
        rounded_sum += round(number)
    
    # Calculate the length of the list
    length_of_list = len(numbers)
    
    # Multiply the sum of rounded numbers by the length of the list
    result = rounded_sum * length_of_list
    
    # Return the final result
    return result
```

This code will correctly round each number in the list, sum them up, and then multiply the sum by the length of the list, as required by the problem statement.

        # Round the number to the nearest integer and add it to the sum

    length_of_list = len(numbers)
