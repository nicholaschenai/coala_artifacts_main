    "raw_msg": "Sure, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.\n\n### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The function should return this final result.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\n- First, we will round each number in the list to the nearest integer.\n- Next, we will calculate the sum of these rounded numbers.\n- We will then determine the length of the list.\n- Finally, we will multiply the sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the list and return the result.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction round_and_sum(numbers):\n    initialize a variable rounded_sum to 0\n    for each number in the list numbers:\n        round the number to the nearest integer\n        add the rounded number to rounded_sum\n    calculate the length of the list numbers\n    multiply rounded_sum by the length of the list\n    return the result\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef round_and_sum(numbers):\n    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of rounded numbers\n    rounded_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Round the number to the nearest integer and add it to the sum\n        rounded_sum += round(number)\n    \n    # Calculate the length of the list\n    length_of_list = len(numbers)\n    \n    # Multiply the sum of rounded numbers by the length of the list\n    result = rounded_sum * length_of_list\n    \n    # Return the final result\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code will correctly round each number in the list, sum them up, and then multiply the sum by the length of the list, as required by the problem statement.",
