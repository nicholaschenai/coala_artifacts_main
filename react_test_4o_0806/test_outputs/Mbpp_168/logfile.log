You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/168 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and a single number as input. The function should return the number of times the single number appears in the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each element in the list.
   - We will keep a counter that starts at zero.
   - For each element in the list, we will check if it matches the given number.
   - If it matches, we will increment the counter by one.
   - After checking all elements, we will return the counter as the result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function frequency(lst, num):
       initialize counter to 0
       for each element in lst:
           if element equals num:
               increment counter by 1
       return counter
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def frequency(lst, num):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for element in lst:
        # Check if the current element matches the given number
        if element == num:
            # Increment the counter if there's a match
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of occurrences
    return count
```

This function will correctly count and return the number of times the specified number appears in the list.
