    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and a single number as input. The function should return the number of times the single number appears in the list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each element in the list.\n   - We will keep a counter that starts at zero.\n   - For each element in the list, we will check if it matches the given number.\n   - If it matches, we will increment the counter by one.\n   - After checking all elements, we will return the counter as the result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function frequency(lst, num):\n       initialize counter to 0\n       for each element in lst:\n           if element equals num:\n               increment counter by 1\n       return counter\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef frequency(lst, num):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # Check if the current element matches the given number\n        if element == num:\n            # Increment the counter if there's a match\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count and return the number of times the specified number appears in the list.",
