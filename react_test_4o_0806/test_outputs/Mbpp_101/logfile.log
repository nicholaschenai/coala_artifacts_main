You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes an array (list) and an integer `k` as inputs. The function should return the element at the `k`-th position in the array, using 1-based indexing. This means that if `k` is 1, we return the first element of the array, if `k` is 2, we return the second element, and so on.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Since Python uses 0-based indexing, we need to adjust the index by subtracting 1 from `k` to access the correct element in the list. For example, to get the 1st element (1-based), we access the 0th index (0-based). Therefore, the solution involves simply returning the element at index `k-1` from the list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `kth_element` that takes a list `arr` and an integer `k`.
   - Return the element at index `k-1` from the list `arr`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def kth_element(arr: list, k: int) -> int:
    # Return the element at the (k-1)th index of the list to account for 1-based indexing
    return arr[k - 1]
```

This function will correctly return the `k`-th element of the list using 1-based indexing by accessing the `(k-1)`-th index of the list.
