    "raw_msg": "\n### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes an array (list) and an integer `k` as inputs. The function should return the element at the `k`-th position in the array, using 1-based indexing. This means that if `k` is 1, we return the first element of the array, if `k` is 2, we return the second element, and so on.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Since Python uses 0-based indexing, we need to adjust the index by subtracting 1 from `k` to access the correct element in the list. For example, to get the 1st element (1-based), we access the 0th index (0-based). Therefore, the solution involves simply returning the element at index `k-1` from the list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `kth_element` that takes a list `arr` and an integer `k`.\n   - Return the element at index `k-1` from the list `arr`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef kth_element(arr: list, k: int) -> int:\n    # Return the element at the (k-1)th index of the list to account for 1-based indexing\n    return arr[k - 1]\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the `k`-th element of the list using 1-based indexing by accessing the `(k-1)`-th index of the list.",
