    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that checks if a given number is greater than all the elements in a provided list. If the number is greater than every element in the list, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Compare the given number with each element.\n3. If the number is found to be less than or equal to any element in the list, return `False`.\n4. If the loop completes without finding any element greater than or equal to the number, return `True`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction check_greater(arr, num):\n    for each element in arr:\n        if num is less than or equal to element:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_greater(arr, num):\n    # Iterate through each element in the array\n    for element in arr:\n        # If the number is less than or equal to the current element\n        if num <= element:\n            # Return False as the number is not greater than this element\n            return False\n    # If the loop completes, the number is greater than all elements\n    return True\n```",
