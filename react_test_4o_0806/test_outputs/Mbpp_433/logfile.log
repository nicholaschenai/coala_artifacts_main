You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to check whether the entered number is greater than the elements of the given array.

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/433 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if a given number is greater than all the elements in a provided list. If the number is greater than every element in the list, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate through each element in the list.
2. Compare the given number with each element.
3. If the number is found to be less than or equal to any element in the list, return `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any element greater than or equal to the number, return `True`.

### Pseudocode

```
function check_greater(arr, num):
    for each element in arr:
        if num is less than or equal to element:
            return False
    return True
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def check_greater(arr, num):
    # Iterate through each element in the array
    for element in arr:
        # If the number is less than or equal to the current element
        if num <= element:
            # Return False as the number is not greater than this element
            return False
    # If the loop completes, the number is greater than all elements
    return True
```
