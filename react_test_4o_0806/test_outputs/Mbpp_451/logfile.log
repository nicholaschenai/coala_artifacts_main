INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/451 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

[END PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/451 [prompt] 
## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/451 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all whitespace characters removed.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We can iterate over each character in the input string.
   - For each character, check if it is not a whitespace.
   - If it is not a whitespace, add it to a new string.
   - Return the new string which will have all the non-whitespace characters from the original string.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `remove_whitespaces` that takes a string `s` as input.
   - Initialize an empty string `result`.
   - For each character `char` in the string `s`:
     - If `char` is not a whitespace:
       - Append `char` to `result`.
   - Return `result`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def remove_whitespaces(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to store the result
    result = ''
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is not a whitespace
        if not char.isspace():
            # Append the non-whitespace character to the result
            result += char
    
    # Return the result string with all whitespaces removed
    return result
```

This function will remove all whitespace characters from the input string and return the resulting string.

        # Check if the character is not a whitespace
        if not char.isspace():
            # Append the non-whitespace character to the result
            result += char
    
    # Return the result string with all whitespaces removed

            result += char
    
    # Return the result string with all whitespaces removed
    return result
```

This function will remove all whitespace characters from the input string and return the resulting string.
