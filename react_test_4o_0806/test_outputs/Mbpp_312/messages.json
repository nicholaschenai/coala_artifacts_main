The formula for the volume of a cone is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the base of the cone and \\(h\\) is the height of the cone.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Formula**: The volume of a cone is calculated using the formula \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h\\).\n2. **Implement the Formula**: Use the given radius and height to compute the volume using the formula.\n3. **Return the Result**: Return the computed volume.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `volume_cone` that takes two parameters: `radius` and `height`.\n2. Calculate the volume using the formula: \\(\\text{volume} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius}^2 \\times \\text{height}\\).\n3. Return the calculated volume.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_cone(radius: float, height: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the volume of the cone using the formula\n    volume = (1/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```\n\nThis function uses the `math.pi` constant for the value of \\(\\pi\\) and follows the formula for the volume of a cone. The function takes the radius and height as inputs, computes the volume, and returns it."
