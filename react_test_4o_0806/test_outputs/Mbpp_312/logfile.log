INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/312 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a cone given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cone is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius of the base of the cone and \(h\) is the height of the cone.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Formula**: The volume of a cone is calculated using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\).
2. **Implement the Formula**: Use the given radius and height to compute the volume using the formula.
3. **Return the Result**: Return the computed volume.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `volume_cone` that takes two parameters: `radius` and `height`.
2. Calculate the volume using the formula: \(\text{volume} = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height}\).
3. Return the calculated volume.

### Final Python Solution

```python
import math

def volume_cone(radius: float, height: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the volume of the cone using the formula
    volume = (1/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 2) * height
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
```

This function uses the `math.pi` constant for the value of \(\pi\) and follows the formula for the volume of a cone. The function takes the radius and height as inputs, computes the volume, and returns it.

    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
