You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/162 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to calculate the sum of a series that starts with a given number `n` and decreases by 2 in each subsequent term until the term becomes zero or negative. Specifically, the series is: `n, n-2, n-4, ...,` and so on. We need to sum all these terms.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can:
- Start with the initial number `n`.
- Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum.
- Use a loop to iterate over the series, decreasing the term by 2 each time.
- Add each term to the sum until the term becomes zero or negative.
- Return the sum.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function sum_series(n):
    initialize sum to 0
    for i from 0 to n // 2 (inclusive):
        calculate term as n - 2 * i
        add term to sum
    return sum
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def sum_series(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over the series from i = 0 to n // 2
    for i in range(n // 2 + 1):
        # Calculate the current term in the series
        term = n - 2 * i
        
        # Add the current term to the total sum
        total_sum += term
    
    # Return the total sum of the series
    return total_sum
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of the series as described in the problem statement.
