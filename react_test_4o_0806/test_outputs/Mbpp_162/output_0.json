    "raw_msg": "Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.\n\n### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to calculate the sum of a series that starts with a given number `n` and decreases by 2 in each subsequent term until the term becomes zero or negative. Specifically, the series is: `n, n-2, n-4, ...,` and so on. We need to sum all these terms.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can:\n- Start with the initial number `n`.\n- Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum.\n- Use a loop to iterate over the series, decreasing the term by 2 each time.\n- Add each term to the sum until the term becomes zero or negative.\n- Return the sum.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction sum_series(n):\n    initialize sum to 0\n    for i from 0 to n // 2 (inclusive):\n        calculate term as n - 2 * i\n        add term to sum\n    return sum\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef sum_series(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the series from i = 0 to n // 2\n    for i in range(n // 2 + 1):\n        # Calculate the current term in the series\n        term = n - 2 * i\n        \n        # Add the current term to the total sum\n        total_sum += term\n    \n    # Return the total sum of the series\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the sum of the series as described in the problem statement.",
