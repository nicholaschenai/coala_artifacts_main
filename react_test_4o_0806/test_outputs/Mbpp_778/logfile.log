The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/778 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of elements and groups consecutive duplicate elements into sublists. For example, if the input list is `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]`, the output should be `[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Start with an empty list to hold the result.
   - Iterate through the input list.
   - Use a temporary list to keep track of the current group of consecutive duplicates.
   - For each element in the list:
     - If the temporary list is empty or the current element is the same as the last element in the temporary list, add the element to the temporary list.
     - If the current element is different from the last element in the temporary list, add the temporary list to the result list and start a new temporary list with the current element.
   - After the loop, add the last temporary list to the result list.
   - Return the result list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):
       if lst is empty:
           return an empty list
       
       result = []
       current_group = [lst[0]]
       
       for each element in lst starting from the second element:
           if element is equal to the last element in current_group:
               add element to current_group
           else:
               add current_group to result
               start a new current_group with the element
       
       add the last current_group to result
       return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def pack_consecutive_duplicates(lst):
    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list
    if not lst:
        return []
    
    # Initialize the result list and the first group with the first element
    result = []
    current_group = [lst[0]]
    
    # Iterate over the list starting from the second element
    for element in lst[1:]:
        # If the current element is the same as the last element in the current group
        if element == current_group[-1]:
            # Add the element to the current group
            current_group.append(element)
        else:
            # Otherwise, add the current group to the result
            result.append(current_group)
            # Start a new group with the current element
            current_group = [element]
    
    # Add the last group to the result
    result.append(current_group)
    
    # Return the result list
    return result
```

This solution iterates through the list once, maintaining a temporary list for the current group of consecutive duplicates, and appends it to the result list whenever a new element is encountered. This ensures that all consecutive duplicates are grouped correctly.

    # Return the result list
