You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/88 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a dictionary. This dictionary should contain each unique number from the list as keys and the number of times each number appears in the list as their corresponding values.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each element in the list.
   - We will use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each element.
   - For each element, if it is already in the dictionary, we will increment its count by 1.
   - If the element is not in the dictionary, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.
   - Finally, we will return the dictionary containing the frequencies of all elements.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function freq_count that takes a list as input
       Initialize an empty dictionary called frequency_dict
       For each element in the list:
           If the element is already a key in frequency_dict:
               Increment the value associated with that key by 1
           Else:
               Add the element as a key to frequency_dict with a value of 1
       Return frequency_dict
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def freq_count(lst):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store frequencies
    frequency_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for element in lst:
        # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if element in frequency_dict:
            frequency_dict[element] += 1
        # If the element is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
        else:
            frequency_dict[element] = 1
    
    # Return the dictionary containing frequencies of all elements
    return frequency_dict
```

This code will correctly compute the frequency of each element in the input list and return the result as a dictionary.

        else:
            frequency_dict[element] = 1
    
    # Return the dictionary containing frequencies of all elements
    return frequency_dict
