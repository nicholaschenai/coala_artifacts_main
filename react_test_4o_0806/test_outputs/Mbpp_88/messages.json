This dictionary should contain each unique number from the list as keys and the number of times each number appears in the list as their corresponding values.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each element in the list.\n   - We will use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each element.\n   - For each element, if it is already in the dictionary, we will increment its count by 1.\n   - If the element is not in the dictionary, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n   - Finally, we will return the dictionary containing the frequencies of all elements.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function freq_count that takes a list as input\n       Initialize an empty dictionary called frequency_dict\n       For each element in the list:\n           If the element is already a key in frequency_dict:\n               Increment the value associated with that key by 1\n           Else:\n               Add the element as a key to frequency_dict with a value of 1\n       Return frequency_dict\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef freq_count(lst):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store frequencies\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if element in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[element] += 1\n        # If the element is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[element] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing frequencies of all elements\n    return frequency_dict\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the frequency of each element in the input list and return the result as a dictionary."
