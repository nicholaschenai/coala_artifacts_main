You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/72 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as the difference of two perfect squares. In other words, for a given integer `n`, we need to check if there exist integers `a` and `b` such that `n = a^2 - b^2`.

## Conceptual Solution

The expression `a^2 - b^2` can be rewritten using the difference of squares formula: 

\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \]

For `n` to be expressed as the difference of two squares, it must be possible to find integers `a` and `b` such that the product `(a - b)(a + b)` equals `n`.

### Key Observations:
1. If `n` is odd, it can always be expressed as the difference of two squares. This is because we can choose `a` and `b` such that `a - b = 1` and `a + b = n`, which are both integers.
2. If `n` is even, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if `n` is divisible by 4. This is because for even `n`, both `a - b` and `a + b` must be even, which implies `n` must be divisible by 4.

## Pseudocode

1. If `n` is odd, return `True`.
2. If `n` is even:
   - Check if `n` is divisible by 4.
   - If `n` is divisible by 4, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

## Python Code

```python
def dif_Square(n: int) -> bool:
    # Check if n is odd
    if n % 2 != 0:
        return True
    # Check if n is even and divisible by 4
    elif n % 4 == 0:
        return True
    # If n is even but not divisible by 4
    else:
        return False
```
