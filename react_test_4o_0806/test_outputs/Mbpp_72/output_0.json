    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as the difference of two perfect squares. In other words, for a given integer `n`, we need to check if there exist integers `a` and `b` such that `n = a^2 - b^2`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nThe expression `a^2 - b^2` can be rewritten using the difference of squares formula: \n\n\\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\]\n\nFor `n` to be expressed as the difference of two squares, it must be possible to find integers `a` and `b` such that the product `(a - b)(a + b)` equals `n`.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. If `n` is odd, it can always be expressed as the difference of two squares. This is because we can choose `a` and `b` such that `a - b = 1` and `a + b = n`, which are both integers.\n2. If `n` is even, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if `n` is divisible by 4. This is because for even `n`, both `a - b` and `a + b` must be even, which implies `n` must be divisible by 4.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. If `n` is odd, return `True`.\n2. If `n` is even:\n   - Check if `n` is divisible by 4.\n   - If `n` is divisible by 4, return `True`.\n   - Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if n is odd\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return True\n    # Check if n is even and divisible by 4\n    elif n % 4 == 0:\n        return True\n    # If n is even but not divisible by 4\n    else:\n        return False\n```",
