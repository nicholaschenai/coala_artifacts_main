        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a Python function that checks if the number of divisors of a given integer is even. The function should return `True` if the count of divisors is even, and `False` otherwise.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Divisors**: For a given integer `n`, a divisor is any integer `d` such that `n % d == 0`.\n2. **Count Divisors**: Iterate through all integers from 1 to `n` and count how many of them are divisors of `n`.\n3. **Check Evenness**: Determine if the count of divisors is even by checking if the count modulo 2 equals zero.\n4. **Return Result**: Return `True` if the count is even, otherwise return `False`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_divisors(n):\n    initialize count to 0\n    for each integer i from 1 to n:\n        if n is divisible by i:\n            increment count by 1\n    if count is even:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Initialize the count of divisors to 0\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # Increment the count of divisors\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Check if the count of divisors is even\n    return count % 2 == 0\n```\n\nThis function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, counts how many of them are divisors of `n`, and then checks if this count is even. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`."
