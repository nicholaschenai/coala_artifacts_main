The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/781 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that checks if the number of divisors of a given integer is even. The function should return `True` if the count of divisors is even, and `False` otherwise.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Divisors**: For a given integer `n`, a divisor is any integer `d` such that `n % d == 0`.
2. **Count Divisors**: Iterate through all integers from 1 to `n` and count how many of them are divisors of `n`.
3. **Check Evenness**: Determine if the count of divisors is even by checking if the count modulo 2 equals zero.
4. **Return Result**: Return `True` if the count is even, otherwise return `False`.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_divisors(n):
    initialize count to 0
    for each integer i from 1 to n:
        if n is divisible by i:
            increment count by 1
    if count is even:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_divisors(n: int) -> bool:
    # Initialize the count of divisors to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # Increment the count of divisors
            count += 1
    
    # Check if the count of divisors is even
    return count % 2 == 0
```

This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, counts how many of them are divisors of `n`, and then checks if this count is even. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

 ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that checks if the number of divisors of a given integer is even. The function should return `True` if the count of divisors is even, and `False` otherwise.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Divisors**: For a given integer `n`, a divisor is any integer `d` such that `n % d == 0`.
2. **Count Divisors**: Iterate through all integers from 1 to `n` and count how many of them are divisors of `n`.

4. **Return Result**: Return `True` if the count is even, otherwise return `False`.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_divisors(n):
    initialize count to 0
    for each integer i from 1 to n:
        if n is divisible by i:
            increment count by 1
    if count is even:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_divisors(n: int) -> bool:
    # Initialize the count of divisors to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # Increment the count of divisors
            count += 1
    
    # Check if the count of divisors is even
    return count % 2 == 0
```

This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, counts how many of them are divisors of `n`, and then checks if this count is even. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
