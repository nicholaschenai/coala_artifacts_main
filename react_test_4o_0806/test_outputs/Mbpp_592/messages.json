        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients for a given integer `n`. The binomial coefficient, often denoted as C(n, k), represents the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Binomial Coefficients**: The binomial coefficient C(n, k) is calculated as `n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`, where `!` denotes factorial.\n\n2. **Consecutive Binomial Coefficients**: For a given `n`, the consecutive binomial coefficients are C(n, 0), C(n, 1), ..., C(n, n).\n\n3. **Product of Consecutive Coefficients**: We need to find the product of each pair of consecutive coefficients: C(n, 0) * C(n, 1), C(n, 1) * C(n, 2), ..., C(n, n-1) * C(n, n).\n\n4. **Sum of Products**: Sum up all these products to get the final result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `factorial` to compute the factorial of a number.\n2. Define a function `binomial_coefficient` to compute C(n, k) using the factorial function.\n3. Define the main function `sum_Of_product(n)`:\n   - Initialize a variable `sum_product` to 0.\n   - Loop over `k` from 0 to `n-1`:\n     - Calculate the product of C(n, k) and C(n, k+1).\n     - Add this product to `sum_product`.\n   - Return `sum_product`.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(x: int) -> int:\n    if x == 0 or x == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(2, x + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\ndef binomial_coefficient(n: int, k: int) -> int:\n    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))\n\ndef sum_Of_product(n: int) -> int:\n    sum_product = 0\n    for k in range(n):\n        product = binomial_coefficient(n, k) * binomial_coefficient(n, k + 1)\n        sum_product += product\n    return sum_product\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **factorial**: Computes the factorial of a number using a loop.\n- **binomial_coefficient**: Uses the factorial function to compute the binomial coefficient C(n, k).\n- **sum_Of_product**: Iterates over each pair of consecutive binomial coefficients, computes their product, and accumulates the sum of these products. The function returns the final sum."
