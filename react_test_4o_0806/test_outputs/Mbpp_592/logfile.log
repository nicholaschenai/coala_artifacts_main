INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/592 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the product of consecutive binomial coefficients for a given integer `n`. The binomial coefficient, often denoted as C(n, k), represents the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand Binomial Coefficients**: The binomial coefficient C(n, k) is calculated as `n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`, where `!` denotes factorial.

2. **Consecutive Binomial Coefficients**: For a given `n`, the consecutive binomial coefficients are C(n, 0), C(n, 1), ..., C(n, n).

3. **Product of Consecutive Coefficients**: We need to find the product of each pair of consecutive coefficients: C(n, 0) * C(n, 1), C(n, 1) * C(n, 2), ..., C(n, n-1) * C(n, n).

4. **Sum of Products**: Sum up all these products to get the final result.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `factorial` to compute the factorial of a number.
2. Define a function `binomial_coefficient` to compute C(n, k) using the factorial function.
3. Define the main function `sum_Of_product(n)`:
   - Initialize a variable `sum_product` to 0.
   - Loop over `k` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - Calculate the product of C(n, k) and C(n, k+1).
     - Add this product to `sum_product`.
   - Return `sum_product`.

### Python Code

```python
def factorial(x: int) -> int:
    if x == 0 or x == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, x + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

def binomial_coefficient(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))

def sum_Of_product(n: int) -> int:
    sum_product = 0
    for k in range(n):
        product = binomial_coefficient(n, k) * binomial_coefficient(n, k + 1)
        sum_product += product
    return sum_product
```

### Explanation

- **factorial**: Computes the factorial of a number using a loop.
- **binomial_coefficient**: Uses the factorial function to compute the binomial coefficient C(n, k).
- **sum_Of_product**: Iterates over each pair of consecutive binomial coefficients, computes their product, and accumulates the sum of these products. The function returns the final sum.
