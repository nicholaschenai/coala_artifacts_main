    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` even natural numbers. \n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Even Numbers**: The even natural numbers start from 2 and increase by 2 for each subsequent even number. So, the first `n` even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.\n   \n2. **Square Each Even Number**: For each of these even numbers, calculate its square.\n\n3. **Sum the Squares**: Add up all the squared values to get the final result.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a variable `sum_of_squares` to 0 to keep track of the sum.\n2. Loop over a range from 1 to `n` (inclusive):\n   - For each `i` in this range, calculate the `i`-th even number as `2 * i`.\n   - Square this even number.\n   - Add the squared value to `sum_of_squares`.\n3. Return `sum_of_squares`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of squares to 0\n    sum_of_squares = 0\n    \n    # Loop over the first n even numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th even number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Add the square of the even number to the sum\n        sum_of_squares += even_number ** 2\n    \n    # Return the total sum of squares\n    return sum_of_squares\n```",
