You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/566 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the sum of its digits.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Convert the integer to a string to easily access each digit.
   - Iterate over each character in the string representation of the number.
   - Convert each character back to an integer.
   - Sum all these integer values.
   - Return the total sum.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_digits(n):
       convert n to a string
       initialize sum to 0
       for each character in the string:
           convert character to an integer
           add the integer to sum
       return sum
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_digits(n: int) -> int:
    # Convert the integer to a string to iterate over each digit
    str_n = str(n)
    
    # Initialize the sum of digits to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string representation of the number
    for char in str_n:
        # Convert the character back to an integer and add it to the total sum
        total_sum += int(char)
    
    # Return the total sum of the digits
    return total_sum
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character, converting each character back to an integer, and summing these integers.
