We can use this method to transform the input string to uppercase and return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `is_upper` that takes a single parameter `s`.\n   - Use the `upper()` method on the string `s` to convert it to uppercase.\n   - Return the resulting uppercase string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_upper(s: str) -> str:\n    # Convert the input string to uppercase using the upper() method\n    uppercase_string = s.upper()\n    # Return the uppercase string\n    return uppercase_string\n```\n\nThis function will take any string input and return it in uppercase, as required by the problem statement."
