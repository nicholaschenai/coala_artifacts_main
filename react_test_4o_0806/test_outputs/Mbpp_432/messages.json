        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the median length of a trapezium (trapezoid). The trapezium is defined by three lengths: the two parallel sides (bases) and the height. The median of a trapezium is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the median length of a trapezium, we need to:\n   - Take the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases) as inputs.\n   - Calculate the average of these two lengths.\n   - Return this average as the median length of the trapezium.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function median_trapezium(base1, base2, height):\n       calculate the average of base1 and base2\n       return the average\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef median_trapezium(base1: int, base2: int, height: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the average of the two bases\n    median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2\n    # Return the median length as an integer\n    return int(median_length)\n```\n\nThis function takes three integer inputs: `base1`, `base2`, and `height`. It calculates the median length of the trapezium by averaging the two base lengths and returns the result as an integer. The height is not used in the calculation of the median length."
