You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/432 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the median length of a trapezium (trapezoid). The trapezium is defined by three lengths: the two parallel sides (bases) and the height. The median of a trapezium is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the median length of a trapezium, we need to:
   - Take the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases) as inputs.
   - Calculate the average of these two lengths.
   - Return this average as the median length of the trapezium.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function median_trapezium(base1, base2, height):
       calculate the average of base1 and base2
       return the average
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def median_trapezium(base1: int, base2: int, height: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the average of the two bases
    median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2
    # Return the median length as an integer
    return int(median_length)
```

This function takes three integer inputs: `base1`, `base2`, and `height`. It calculates the median length of the trapezium by averaging the two base lengths and returns the result as an integer. The height is not used in the calculation of the median length.

def median_trapezium(base1: int, base2: int, height: int) -> int:

    median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2
    # Return the median length as an integer
    return int(median_length)
