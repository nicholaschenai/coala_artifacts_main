    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nThe task is to find the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that is not a power of 2. The function should return the nth polite number when given an integer n.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Polite Numbers**: Polite numbers are all positive integers except those that are powers of 2. For example, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, etc., are polite numbers, while 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., are not.\n\n2. **Generate Polite Numbers**: To find the nth polite number, we need to generate polite numbers in sequence and count them until we reach the nth one.\n\n3. **Check for Powers of 2**: To determine if a number is a power of 2, we can use the property that a number is a power of 2 if it has only one bit set in its binary representation. This can be checked using the condition `(x & (x - 1)) == 0`.\n\n4. **Iterate and Count**: Start from the number 1 and iterate upwards, checking each number to see if it is not a power of 2. Count each polite number until the nth one is found.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction is_polite(n):\n    count = 0\n    number = 1\n    while count < n:\n        if number is not a power of 2:\n            increment count\n        increment number\n    return the last polite number found\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_polite(n: int) -> int:\n    def is_power_of_two(x: int) -> bool:\n        # A number is a power of two if it has only one bit set in its binary representation\n        return (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and x != 0\n\n    count = 0\n    number = 1\n    while count < n:\n        if not is_power_of_two(number):\n            count += 1\n        number += 1\n    \n    # The loop exits when count == n, but number has been incremented one extra time\n    return number - 1\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Helper Function**: `is_power_of_two(x)` checks if a number is a power of two using bitwise operations.\n- **Main Logic**: We initialize `count` to 0 and `number` to 1. We iterate, checking each number to see if it is not a power of two. If it is not, we increment the `count`.\n- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until `count` equals `n`, meaning we have found the nth polite number.\n- **Return Value**: Since `number` is incremented one extra time after finding the nth polite number, we return `number - 1`.",
