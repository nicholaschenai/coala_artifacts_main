    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a tuple and a list as inputs. The function should count how many times the elements from the list appear in the tuple and return that count.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - Iterate over each element in the tuple.\n   - For each element in the tuple, check if it is present in the list.\n   - If it is present, increment the counter by one.\n   - After iterating through the entire tuple, return the counter as the result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function count_Occurrence(input_tuple, input_list):\n       initialize counter to 0\n       for each element in input_tuple:\n           if element is in input_list:\n               increment counter by 1\n       return counter\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_Occurrence(input_tuple: tuple, input_list: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences\n    counter = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the tuple\n    for element in input_tuple:\n        # Check if the current element is in the list\n        if element in input_list:\n            # Increment the counter if the element is found in the list\n            counter += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return counter\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of times elements from the list appear in the tuple and return that count.",
