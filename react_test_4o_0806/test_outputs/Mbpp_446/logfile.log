You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/446 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a tuple and a list as inputs. The function should count how many times the elements from the list appear in the tuple and return that count.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Initialize a counter to zero.
   - Iterate over each element in the tuple.
   - For each element in the tuple, check if it is present in the list.
   - If it is present, increment the counter by one.
   - After iterating through the entire tuple, return the counter as the result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function count_Occurrence(input_tuple, input_list):
       initialize counter to 0
       for each element in input_tuple:
           if element is in input_list:
               increment counter by 1
       return counter
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def count_Occurrence(input_tuple: tuple, input_list: list) -> int:
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences
    counter = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the tuple
    for element in input_tuple:
        # Check if the current element is in the list
        if element in input_list:
            # Increment the counter if the element is found in the list
            counter += 1
    
    # Return the total count of occurrences
    return counter
```

This function will correctly count the number of times elements from the list appear in the tuple and return that count.
