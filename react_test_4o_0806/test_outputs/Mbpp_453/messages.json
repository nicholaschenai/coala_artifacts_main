        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the sum of all even factors of a given integer. A factor of a number is an integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder. An even factor is simply a factor that is an even number.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Identify all factors of the given number.\n2. Filter out the even factors from the list of all factors.\n3. Sum up these even factors.\n4. Return the sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a variable `sum_even_factors` to 0 to keep track of the sum of even factors.\n2. Loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number (inclusive).\n   - For each number `i`, check if it is a factor of the given number by verifying if the remainder of the division of the number by `i` is zero.\n   - If `i` is a factor and `i` is even, add `i` to `sum_even_factors`.\n3. After the loop, return `sum_even_factors`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef sumofFactors(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of even factors to 0\n    sum_even_factors = 0\n    \n    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a factor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # Check if the factor is even\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                # Add the even factor to the sum\n                sum_even_factors += i\n    \n    # Return the sum of even factors\n    return sum_even_factors\n```\n\nThis code will correctly calculate the sum of all even factors of a given integer `n`. It iterates through all possible factors, checks if they are even, and accumulates their sum."
