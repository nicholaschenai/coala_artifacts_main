        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in a given array. A bitonic subsequence is a sequence that first increases and then decreases. The task is to identify such a subsequence in the array and calculate the maximum possible sum of its elements.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Increasing Subsequences**: For each element in the array, calculate the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at that element. This can be done using dynamic programming by iterating over the array and keeping track of the maximum sum for each element.\n\n2. **Identify Decreasing Subsequences**: Similarly, for each element, calculate the maximum sum of a decreasing subsequence starting from that element. This can be done by iterating over the array in reverse order.\n\n3. **Combine Results**: For each element in the array, calculate the sum of the maximum increasing subsequence ending at that element and the maximum decreasing subsequence starting from that element, subtracting the element itself once (since it is counted in both subsequences).\n\n4. **Find Maximum Sum**: The result will be the maximum of these combined sums.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize two arrays `inc` and `dec` of the same length as the input array, filled with zeros.\n2. For each element `i` in the array:\n   - Calculate `inc[i]` as the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at `i`.\n3. For each element `i` in the array (in reverse order):\n   - Calculate `dec[i]` as the maximum sum of a decreasing subsequence starting from `i`.\n4. Initialize a variable `max_sum` to zero.\n5. For each element `i` in the array:\n   - Calculate the combined sum as `inc[i] + dec[i] - array[i]`.\n   - Update `max_sum` if this combined sum is greater than the current `max_sum`.\n6. Return `max_sum`.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef max_sum(array):\n    n = len(array)\n    \n    # Initialize arrays to store the maximum sum of increasing and decreasing subsequences\n    inc = [0] * n\n    dec = [0] * n\n    \n    # Calculate maximum sum of increasing subsequence ending at each element\n    for i in range(n):\n        inc[i] = array[i]\n        for j in range(i):\n            if array[j] < array[i]:\n                inc[i] = max(inc[i], inc[j] + array[i])\n    \n    # Calculate maximum sum of decreasing subsequence starting at each element\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        dec[i] = array[i]\n        for j in range(n-1, i, -1):\n            if array[j] < array[i]:\n                dec[i] = max(dec[i], dec[j] + array[i])\n    \n    # Find the maximum sum of bitonic subsequence\n    max_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, inc[i] + dec[i] - array[i])\n    \n    return max_sum\n```\n\nThis code follows the outlined steps to calculate the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in the given array."
