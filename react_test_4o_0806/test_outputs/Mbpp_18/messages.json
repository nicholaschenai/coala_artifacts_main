The function should remove all characters from the first string that are present in the second string. The result should be a new string containing only the characters from the first string that are not found in the second string.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Characters to Remove**: First, identify all the characters in the second string. These are the characters that need to be removed from the first string.\n2. **Filter the First String**: Iterate through each character in the first string and check if it is present in the second string.\n3. **Build the Result String**: If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, include it in the result string. Otherwise, skip it.\n4. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters in the first string, return the result string.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction remove_dirty_chars(first_string, second_string):\n    create an empty result string\n    for each character in first_string:\n        if character is not in second_string:\n            append character to result string\n    return result string\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(first_string: str, second_string: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = ''\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the first string\n    for char in first_string:\n        # Check if the character is not in the second string\n        if char not in second_string:\n            # If not, add it to the result string\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the final result string\n    return result\n```"
