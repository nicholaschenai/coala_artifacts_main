You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/767 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and a target sum as input. The function should return the number of pairs of numbers in the list that add up to the target sum. Each pair should be counted only once, and the order of numbers in the pair does not matter.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through each number in the list.
   - For each number, we will check if there is another number in the list that, when added to the current number, equals the target sum.
   - We will keep track of the pairs we have already counted to avoid counting the same pair more than once.
   - We will use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number in the list, which will help us efficiently find the complement of the current number that makes up the target sum.
   - As we find valid pairs, we will increment a counter to keep track of the total number of pairs.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):
       initialize a dictionary called frequency_map
       initialize a counter called pair_count to 0
       
       for each number in numbers:
           calculate the complement as target_sum - number
           if complement is in frequency_map:
               increment pair_count by the frequency of the complement
           
           if number is not in frequency_map:
               add number to frequency_map with a count of 0
           increment the count of number in frequency_map by 1
       
       return pair_count
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):
    # Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number

    pair_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Calculate the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the target sum
        complement = target_sum - number
        
        # If the complement is already in the frequency map, it means we have found valid pairs
        if complement in frequency_map:
            # Increment the pair count by the number of times the complement has appeared
