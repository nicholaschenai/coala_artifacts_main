You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/435 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes an integer as input and returns the last digit of that integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - To find the last digit of a number, we can use the modulus operator `%`. By taking the number modulo 10, we can obtain the last digit. This works because dividing a number by 10 shifts all digits to the right, and the remainder of this division is the last digit.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `last_Digit` that takes an integer `n` as input.
   - Use the modulus operator to find the last digit: `last_digit = n % 10`.
   - Return the value of `last_digit`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def last_Digit(n: int) -> int:
    # Use modulus operator to get the last digit of the number
    last_digit = n % 10
    # Return the last digit
    return last_digit
```

This solution uses the modulus operator to efficiently extract the last digit of the given integer.
