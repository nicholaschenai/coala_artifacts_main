    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and an integer `n`. The function should return a new list where each number from the original list is raised to the power of `n`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate over each number in the input list.\n   - For each number, we will compute its `n`-th power.\n   - We will collect these computed values into a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return this new list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `nth_nums` that takes a list `numbers` and an integer `n`.\n   - Initialize an empty list `result`.\n   - For each `number` in `numbers`:\n     - Compute `number` raised to the power of `n`.\n     - Append the result to the `result` list.\n   - Return the `result` list.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef nth_nums(numbers: list, n: int) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Compute the n-th power of the current number\n        powered_number = number ** n\n        # Append the computed power to the result list\n        result.append(powered_number)\n    \n    # Return the list containing all the n-th powers\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each element in the input list, computes its `n`-th power, and collects the results in a new list, which is then returned.",
