You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the nth octagonal number. An octagonal number is a figurate number that represents an octagon. The formula to find the nth octagonal number is given by:

\[ O_n = n \times (3n - 2) \]

where \( n \) is the position in the sequence of octagonal numbers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Formula**: The nth octagonal number can be calculated using the formula \( O_n = n \times (3n - 2) \).
2. **Implement the Formula**: Use the formula directly in the function to compute the nth octagonal number.
3. **Return the Result**: Return the computed octagonal number.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_octagonal(n):
    return n * (3 * n - 2)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_octagonal(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth octagonal number using the formula
    # O_n = n * (3n - 2)
    return n * (3 * n - 2)
```
