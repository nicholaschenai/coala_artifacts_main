You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/732 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every space, comma, or period in the string with a colon.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.
   - For each character, we will check if it is a space, comma, or period.
   - If it is one of these characters, we will replace it with a colon.
   - If it is not, we will keep the character as it is.
   - We will then join all the characters back into a single string and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `replace_specialchar` that takes a string `s` as input.
   - Initialize an empty list `result` to store the modified characters.
   - For each character `char` in the string `s`:
     - If `char` is a space, comma, or period, append a colon to `result`.
     - Otherwise, append `char` to `result`.
   - Join the list `result` into a single string and return it.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def replace_specialchar(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the modified characters
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is a space, comma, or period
        if char in ' ,.':
            # Replace it with a colon
            result.append(':')
        else:
            # Otherwise, keep the character as it is
            result.append(char)
    
    # Join the list of characters into a single string and return it
    return ''.join(result)
```
