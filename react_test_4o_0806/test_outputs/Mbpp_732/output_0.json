    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every space, comma, or period in the string with a colon.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.\n   - For each character, we will check if it is a space, comma, or period.\n   - If it is one of these characters, we will replace it with a colon.\n   - If it is not, we will keep the character as it is.\n   - We will then join all the characters back into a single string and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `replace_specialchar` that takes a string `s` as input.\n   - Initialize an empty list `result` to store the modified characters.\n   - For each character `char` in the string `s`:\n     - If `char` is a space, comma, or period, append a colon to `result`.\n     - Otherwise, append `char` to `result`.\n   - Join the list `result` into a single string and return it.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef replace_specialchar(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the modified characters\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is a space, comma, or period\n        if char in ' ,.':\n            # Replace it with a colon\n            result.append(':')\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, keep the character as it is\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list of characters into a single string and return it\n    return ''.join(result)\n```",
