    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube when given the length of one of its sides.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - A cube has six faces, and each face is a square with an area equal to the square of the side length.\n   - The lateral surface area of a cube is the sum of the areas of the four vertical faces (excluding the top and bottom faces).\n   - Therefore, the lateral surface area can be calculated as four times the area of one face.\n   - If the side length of the cube is `s`, then the area of one face is `s * s`.\n   - Thus, the lateral surface area is `4 * s * s`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `lateralsurface_cube` that takes one parameter `side_length`.\n   - Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula `4 * side_length * side_length`.\n   - Return the calculated lateral surface area.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef lateralsurface_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the lateral surface area of the cube\n    # Lateral surface area = 4 * (side length)^2\n    lateral_surface_area = 4 * side_length * side_length\n    \n    # Return the calculated lateral surface area\n    return lateral_surface_area\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length, as required by the problem statement.",
