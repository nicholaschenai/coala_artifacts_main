You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/266 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube when given the length of one of its sides.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - A cube has six faces, and each face is a square with an area equal to the square of the side length.
   - The lateral surface area of a cube is the sum of the areas of the four vertical faces (excluding the top and bottom faces).
   - Therefore, the lateral surface area can be calculated as four times the area of one face.
   - If the side length of the cube is `s`, then the area of one face is `s * s`.
   - Thus, the lateral surface area is `4 * s * s`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `lateralsurface_cube` that takes one parameter `side_length`.
   - Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula `4 * side_length * side_length`.
   - Return the calculated lateral surface area.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def lateralsurface_cube(side_length: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the lateral surface area of the cube
    # Lateral surface area = 4 * (side length)^2
    lateral_surface_area = 4 * side_length * side_length
    
    # Return the calculated lateral surface area
    return lateral_surface_area
```

This function will correctly compute the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length, as required by the problem statement.
