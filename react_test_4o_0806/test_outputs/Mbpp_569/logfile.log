INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/569 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/569 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. The function should sort each sublist in alphabetical order and return the modified list of lists.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate over each sublist in the main list.
2. Sort each sublist alphabetically.
3. Return the list of lists with each sublist sorted.

### Pseudocode

```
function sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    for each sublist in list_of_lists:
        sort the sublist
    return list_of_lists
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    # Iterate over each sublist in the main list
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Sort the current sublist in place
        sublist.sort()
    # Return the modified list of lists
    return list_of_lists
```
