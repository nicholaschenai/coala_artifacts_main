You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to replace whitespaces with an underscore and vice versa in a given string.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/631 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every whitespace character with an underscore ('_') and every underscore with a whitespace character. The function should return the modified string.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.
   - If the character is a whitespace, we will replace it with an underscore.
   - If the character is an underscore, we will replace it with a whitespace.
   - If the character is neither, we will keep it unchanged.
   - We will build a new string with these modifications and return it.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `replace_spaces` that takes a string `s` as input.
   - Initialize an empty string `result`.
   - For each character `char` in the string `s`:
     - If `char` is a whitespace, append an underscore to `result`.
     - Else if `char` is an underscore, append a whitespace to `result`.
     - Else, append `char` to `result`.
   - Return the `result` string.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def replace_spaces(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to store the result
    result = ''
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # If the character is a whitespace, replace it with an underscore
        if char == ' ':
            result += '_'
        # If the character is an underscore, replace it with a whitespace
        elif char == '_':
            result += ' '
        # Otherwise, keep the character unchanged
        else:
            result += char
    
    # Return the modified string
    return result
```

This solution iterates through the input string once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the creation of the new result string.

        # Otherwise, keep the character unchanged
        else:
            result += char
    
    # Return the modified string
