    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every whitespace character with an underscore ('_') and every underscore with a whitespace character. The function should return the modified string.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.\n   - If the character is a whitespace, we will replace it with an underscore.\n   - If the character is an underscore, we will replace it with a whitespace.\n   - If the character is neither, we will keep it unchanged.\n   - We will build a new string with these modifications and return it.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `replace_spaces` that takes a string `s` as input.\n   - Initialize an empty string `result`.\n   - For each character `char` in the string `s`:\n     - If `char` is a whitespace, append an underscore to `result`.\n     - Else if `char` is an underscore, append a whitespace to `result`.\n     - Else, append `char` to `result`.\n   - Return the `result` string.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef replace_spaces(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = ''\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # If the character is a whitespace, replace it with an underscore\n        if char == ' ':\n            result += '_'\n        # If the character is an underscore, replace it with a whitespace\n        elif char == '_':\n            result += ' '\n        # Otherwise, keep the character unchanged\n        else:\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the modified string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the input string once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the creation of the new result string.",
