        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list containing both strings and numbers and returns the maximum numerical value from that list. The list is heterogeneous, meaning it contains elements of different data types, but we are only interested in the numerical values.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Filter the List**: First, we need to filter out the non-numeric elements from the list. We can do this by checking the type of each element.\n2. **Find the Maximum**: Once we have a list of only numeric elements, we can use Python's built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `max_val` that takes a list `lst` as an argument.\n2. Initialize an empty list `numeric_values` to store numeric elements.\n3. Iterate over each element `item` in `lst`:\n   - If `item` is an instance of `int` or `float`, append it to `numeric_values`.\n4. Use the `max()` function to find the maximum value in `numeric_values`.\n5. Return the maximum value.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_val(lst):\n    # Initialize a list to store numeric values\n    numeric_values = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each item in the input list\n    for item in lst:\n        # Check if the item is an integer or a float\n        if isinstance(item, (int, float)):\n            # Add the numeric item to the numeric_values list\n            numeric_values.append(item)\n    \n    # Return the maximum value from the numeric_values list\n    return max(numeric_values)\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list, filters out non-numeric elements, and then finds the maximum value among the numeric elements. The use of `isinstance()` ensures that we only consider integers and floats, which are the numeric types in Python."
