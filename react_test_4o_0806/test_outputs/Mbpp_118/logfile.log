You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/118 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of words. The words in the list should be split based on spaces in the input string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will use Python's built-in string method `split()` which, by default, splits a string into a list of words based on spaces.
   - This method will automatically handle multiple spaces and trim any leading or trailing spaces.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `string_to_list` that takes a single parameter `s` (a string).
   - Use the `split()` method on the string `s` to split it into a list of words.
   - Return the resulting list.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def string_to_list(s: str) -> list:
    # Use the split method to divide the string into a list of words based on spaces
    return s.split()
```

This function will take a string, split it into words using spaces as delimiters, and return the list of words. The `split()` method is efficient and handles edge cases like multiple spaces or leading/trailing spaces automatically.
