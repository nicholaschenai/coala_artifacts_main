The words in the list should be split based on spaces in the input string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will use Python's built-in string method `split()` which, by default, splits a string into a list of words based on spaces.\n   - This method will automatically handle multiple spaces and trim any leading or trailing spaces.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `string_to_list` that takes a single parameter `s` (a string).\n   - Use the `split()` method on the string `s` to split it into a list of words.\n   - Return the resulting list.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef string_to_list(s: str) -> list:\n    # Use the split method to divide the string into a list of words based on spaces\n    return s.split()\n```\n\nThis function will take a string, split it into words using spaces as delimiters, and return the list of words. The `split()` method is efficient and handles edge cases like multiple spaces or leading/trailing spaces automatically."
