You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the next smallest integer that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the next smallest palindrome:
   - Start with the number immediately greater than the given integer.
   - Check if this number is a palindrome.
   - If it is, return it.
   - If not, increment the number and check again.
   - Repeat this process until a palindrome is found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function is_palindrome that checks if a number is a palindrome:
       Convert the number to a string
       Check if the string is equal to its reverse
       Return True if they are equal, otherwise False

   Define the main function next_smallest_palindrome:
       Start with the number one greater than the input number
       While True:
           Check if the current number is a palindrome using is_palindrome
           If it is, return the current number
           Otherwise, increment the current number by 1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_palindrome(n: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the number to a string
    s = str(n)
    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse
    return s == s[::-1]

def next_smallest_palindrome(n: int) -> int:
    # Start with the number immediately greater than n
    n += 1
    # Continuously check for the next palindrome
    while True:
        # Check if the current number is a palindrome
        if is_palindrome(n):
            # If it is, return the number
            return n
        # Otherwise, increment the number and check again
        n += 1
```

This solution defines a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a number is a palindrome and uses it in the main function `next_smallest_palindrome` to find the next smallest palindrome greater than the given integer.

        if is_palindrome(n):
            # If it is, return the number
            return n
        # Otherwise, increment the number and check again
