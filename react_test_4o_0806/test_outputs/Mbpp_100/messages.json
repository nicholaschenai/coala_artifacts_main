        "content": "\n## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the next smallest integer that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the next smallest palindrome:\n   - Start with the number immediately greater than the given integer.\n   - Check if this number is a palindrome.\n   - If it is, return it.\n   - If not, increment the number and check again.\n   - Repeat this process until a palindrome is found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function is_palindrome that checks if a number is a palindrome:\n       Convert the number to a string\n       Check if the string is equal to its reverse\n       Return True if they are equal, otherwise False\n\n   Define the main function next_smallest_palindrome:\n       Start with the number one greater than the input number\n       While True:\n           Check if the current number is a palindrome using is_palindrome\n           If it is, return the current number\n           Otherwise, increment the current number by 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    s = str(n)\n    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(n: int) -> int:\n    # Start with the number immediately greater than n\n    n += 1\n    # Continuously check for the next palindrome\n    while True:\n        # Check if the current number is a palindrome\n        if is_palindrome(n):\n            # If it is, return the number\n            return n\n        # Otherwise, increment the number and check again\n        n += 1\n```\n\nThis solution defines a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a number is a palindrome and uses it in the main function `next_smallest_palindrome` to find the next smallest palindrome greater than the given integer."
