        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find two integers, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), such that the equation \\( ax + by = n \\) holds true for given integers \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( n \\). If such integers exist, we should return them as a tuple \\((x, y)\\). If no such integers exist, we should return `None`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \\( ax + by = n \\) is a linear Diophantine equation. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) divides \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Finding a Solution**: If a solution exists, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one particular solution \\((x_0, y_0)\\) to the equation \\( ax + by = \\text{gcd}(a, b) \\). We can then scale this solution by \\( \\frac{n}{\\text{gcd}(a, b)} \\) to get a solution to \\( ax + by = n \\).\n\n3. **Algorithm Steps**:\n   - Compute the GCD of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   - Check if \\( n \\) is divisible by this GCD. If not, return `None`.\n   - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one solution to \\( ax + by = \\text{gcd}(a, b) \\).\n   - Scale this solution to find a solution to \\( ax + by = n \\).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction extended_gcd(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        return (a, 1, 0)\n    else:\n        gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)\n        x = y1\n        y = x1 - (a // b) * y1\n        return (gcd, x, y)\n\nfunction find_solution(a, b, n):\n    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)\n    if n % gcd != 0:\n        return None\n    scale = n // gcd\n    x = x0 * scale\n    y = y0 * scale\n    return (x, y)\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    # Base case: if b is 0, gcd is a, and coefficients are (1, 0)\n    if b == 0:\n        return (a, 1, 0)\n    else:\n        # Recursive call\n        gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)\n        # Update x and y using results of recursion\n        x = y1\n        y = x1 - (a // b) * y1\n        return (gcd, x, y)\n\ndef find_solution(a, b, n):\n    # Get gcd and coefficients for the equation ax + by = gcd(a, b)\n    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)\n    # Check if n is divisible by gcd\n    if n % gcd != 0:\n        return None\n    # Scale the solution to match the equation ax + by = n\n    scale = n // gcd\n    x = x0 * scale\n    y = y0 * scale\n    return (x, y)\n```\n\nThis code uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a solution to the linear Diophantine equation, ensuring that the solution is only returned if it exists."

        "content": "### Analysis of the Issue\n\nThe code correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a solution to the equation \\( ax + by = n \\). However, the solution it finds is not necessarily the one expected by the test case. The test case expects a specific solution \\((2, 1)\\) for the input \\((a=2, b=3, n=7)\\), but the code returns \\((-7, 7)\\), which is also a valid solution.\n\n### Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n1. **Multiple Solutions**: Linear Diophantine equations have infinitely many solutions. The solution returned by the algorithm is a valid one, but it may not match the specific solution expected by the test case.\n\n2. **Expected Solution**: The test case expects a specific solution \\((2, 1)\\). The algorithm needs to be adjusted to find this particular solution or a similar one that satisfies the equation in a more straightforward manner.\n\n### Adjustments Needed\n\nTo address the issue, we need to find a solution that is closer to the expected one. We can adjust the solution by finding a particular solution and then modifying it to find a non-negative solution with smaller values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n### Steps to Adjust the Solution\n\n1. **Find a Particular Solution**: Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one particular solution.\n\n2. **Adjust the Solution**: Modify the solution to find a non-negative solution with smaller values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Return the Adjusted Solution**: Ensure the solution returned is the one expected by the test case or a similar one.\n\nLet's implement these adjustments in the code."
