We need to find two integers, \( x \) and \( y \), such that the equation \( ax + by = n \) holds true for given integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( n \). If such integers exist, we should return them as a tuple \((x, y)\). If no such integers exist, we should return `None`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) is a linear Diophantine equation. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \).

2. **Finding a Solution**: If a solution exists, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one particular solution \((x_0, y_0)\) to the equation \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). We can then scale this solution by \( \frac{n}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \) to get a solution to \( ax + by = n \).

3. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Compute the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \).
   - Check if \( n \) is divisible by this GCD. If not, return `None`.
   - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one solution to \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \).
   - Scale this solution to find a solution to \( ax + by = n \).

### Pseudocode

```
function extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (a, 1, 0)
    else:
        gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
        x = y1
        y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
        return (gcd, x, y)

function find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None
    scale = n // gcd
    x = x0 * scale
    y = y0 * scale
    return (x, y)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    # Base case: if b is 0, gcd is a, and coefficients are (1, 0)
    if b == 0:
        return (a, 1, 0)
    else:
        # Recursive call
        gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
        # Update x and y using results of recursion
        x = y1
        y = x1 - (a // b) * y1

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/160 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

The code correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a solution to the equation \( ax + by = n \). However, the solution it finds is not necessarily the one expected by the test case. The test case expects a specific solution \((2, 1)\) for the input \((a=2, b=3, n=7)\), but the code returns \((-7, 7)\), which is also a valid solution.

### Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Multiple Solutions**: Linear Diophantine equations have infinitely many solutions. The solution returned by the algorithm is a valid one, but it may not match the specific solution expected by the test case.

2. **Expected Solution**: The test case expects a specific solution \((2, 1)\). The algorithm needs to be adjusted to find this particular solution or a similar one that satisfies the equation in a more straightforward manner.

### Adjustments Needed

To address the issue, we need to find a solution that is closer to the expected one. We can adjust the solution by finding a particular solution and then modifying it to find a non-negative solution with smaller values for \( x \) and \( y \).

### Steps to Adjust the Solution

1. **Find a Particular Solution**: Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one particular solution.

2. **Adjust the Solution**: Modify the solution to find a non-negative solution with smaller values for \( x \) and \( y \).

3. **Return the Adjusted Solution**: Ensure the solution returned is the one expected by the test case or a similar one.

Let's implement these adjustments in the code.
