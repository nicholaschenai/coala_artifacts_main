        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits. A triangular number is a number that can be represented in the form of a triangle with dots. The nth triangular number is given by the formula: \n\n\\[ T(n) = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\]\n\nThe task is to find the smallest index `i` such that the triangular number `T(i)` has exactly `n` digits.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Triangular Numbers**: Triangular numbers are generated by the formula \\( T(i) = \\frac{i \\times (i + 1)}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Determine Number of Digits**: The number of digits in a number `x` can be found using the formula `len(str(x))`.\n\n3. **Iterate to Find the Index**: Start from the first triangular number and keep calculating the next triangular number until you find one with exactly `n` digits.\n\n4. **Return the Index**: Once a triangular number with `n` digits is found, return its index.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize `i` to 1.\n2. Loop indefinitely:\n   - Calculate the ith triangular number using the formula \\( T(i) = \\frac{i \\times (i + 1)}{2} \\).\n   - Convert the triangular number to a string and check its length.\n   - If the length of the string is equal to `n`, return `i`.\n   - Increment `i` by 1.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_Index(n: int) -> int:\n    # Start with the first index\n    i = 1\n    while True:\n        # Calculate the ith triangular number\n        triangular_number = (i * (i + 1)) // 2\n        # Check the number of digits in the triangular number\n        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:\n            # If it has n digits, return the index\n            return i\n        # Increment the index\n        i += 1\n```\n\nThis solution iteratively calculates triangular numbers and checks their digit length until it finds one with exactly `n` digits, then returns the corresponding index."
