INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/739 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits. A triangular number is a number that can be represented in the form of a triangle with dots. The nth triangular number is given by the formula: 

\[ T(n) = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]

The task is to find the smallest index `i` such that the triangular number `T(i)` has exactly `n` digits.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand Triangular Numbers**: Triangular numbers are generated by the formula \( T(i) = \frac{i \times (i + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Determine Number of Digits**: The number of digits in a number `x` can be found using the formula `len(str(x))`.

3. **Iterate to Find the Index**: Start from the first triangular number and keep calculating the next triangular number until you find one with exactly `n` digits.

4. **Return the Index**: Once a triangular number with `n` digits is found, return its index.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize `i` to 1.
2. Loop indefinitely:
   - Calculate the ith triangular number using the formula \( T(i) = \frac{i \times (i + 1)}{2} \).
   - Convert the triangular number to a string and check its length.
   - If the length of the string is equal to `n`, return `i`.
   - Increment `i` by 1.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_Index(n: int) -> int:
    # Start with the first index
    i = 1
    while True:
        # Calculate the ith triangular number
        triangular_number = (i * (i + 1)) // 2
        # Check the number of digits in the triangular number
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            # If it has n digits, return the index
            return i
        # Increment the index
        i += 1
```

This solution iteratively calculates triangular numbers and checks their digit length until it finds one with exactly `n` digits, then returns the corresponding index.
