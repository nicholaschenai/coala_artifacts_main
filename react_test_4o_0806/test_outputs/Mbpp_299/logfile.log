You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/299 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains a name (string) and a score (integer). The function should calculate the total score for each unique name and return the name with the highest total score along with that score.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize a Dictionary**: Use a dictionary to keep track of the total scores for each name. The keys will be the names, and the values will be the accumulated scores.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: For each tuple in the list, extract the name and score. Add the score to the corresponding entry in the dictionary. If the name is not already in the dictionary, initialize it with the current score.

3. **Find the Maximum**: After processing all tuples, iterate through the dictionary to find the name with the highest total score.

4. **Return the Result**: Return a tuple containing the name with the highest score and the score itself.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_aggregate(tuples_list):
    initialize an empty dictionary called scores_dict

    for each tuple (name, score) in tuples_list:
        if name is in scores_dict:
            add score to scores_dict[name]
        else:
            set scores_dict[name] = score

    initialize max_name as None
    initialize max_score as 0

    for each name, total_score in scores_dict:
        if total_score > max_score:
            set max_score to total_score
            set max_name to name

    return (max_name, max_score)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def max_aggregate(tuples_list):
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the total scores for each name
    scores_dict = {}

    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for name, score in tuples_list:
        # If the name is already in the dictionary, add the score to the existing total
        if name in scores_dict:
            scores_dict[name] += score
        # If the name is not in the dictionary, initialize it with the current score
        else:
            scores_dict[name] = score

    # Initialize variables to track the name with the maximum score
    max_name = None
    max_score = 0
