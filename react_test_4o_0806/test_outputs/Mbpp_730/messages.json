        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and removes any consecutive duplicate elements. The function should return a new list where only the first occurrence of each consecutive duplicate is kept.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start with an empty list to store the result.\n   - Iterate through the given list of integers.\n   - For each element, check if it is the same as the last element added to the result list.\n   - If it is not the same, add it to the result list.\n   - If it is the same, skip adding it to the result list.\n   - Continue this process until all elements in the input list have been processed.\n   - Return the result list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function consecutive_duplicates(input_list):\n       if input_list is empty:\n           return an empty list\n       \n       initialize result_list with the first element of input_list\n       \n       for each element in input_list starting from the second element:\n           if element is not equal to the last element in result_list:\n               append element to result_list\n       \n       return result_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef consecutive_duplicates(input_list):\n    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list\n    if not input_list:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize the result list with the first element of the input list\n    result_list = [input_list[0]]\n    \n    # Iterate over the input list starting from the second element\n    for element in input_list[1:]:\n        # If the current element is not the same as the last element in the result list\n        if element != result_list[-1]:\n            # Append the current element to the result list\n            result_list.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the result list\n    return result_list\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently removes consecutive duplicates by maintaining a result list and only adding elements that are different from the last added element."
