You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/730 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and removes any consecutive duplicate elements. The function should return a new list where only the first occurrence of each consecutive duplicate is kept.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Start with an empty list to store the result.
   - Iterate through the given list of integers.
   - For each element, check if it is the same as the last element added to the result list.
   - If it is not the same, add it to the result list.
   - If it is the same, skip adding it to the result list.
   - Continue this process until all elements in the input list have been processed.
   - Return the result list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function consecutive_duplicates(input_list):
       if input_list is empty:
           return an empty list
       
       initialize result_list with the first element of input_list
       
       for each element in input_list starting from the second element:
           if element is not equal to the last element in result_list:
               append element to result_list
       
       return result_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def consecutive_duplicates(input_list):
    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list
    if not input_list:
        return []
    
    # Initialize the result list with the first element of the input list
    result_list = [input_list[0]]
    
    # Iterate over the input list starting from the second element
    for element in input_list[1:]:
        # If the current element is not the same as the last element in the result list
        if element != result_list[-1]:
            # Append the current element to the result list
            result_list.append(element)
    
    # Return the result list
    return result_list
```

This solution efficiently removes consecutive duplicates by maintaining a result list and only adding elements that are different from the last added element.

            # Append the current element to the result list
            result_list.append(element)
