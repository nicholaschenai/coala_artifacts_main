You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/556 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and its length as input, and returns the number of pairs of elements in the list whose XOR operation results in an odd number.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR and Odd Numbers**: 
   - The XOR operation between two numbers results in a binary number where each bit is the result of the XOR operation on the corresponding bits of the two numbers.
   - For the XOR of two numbers to be odd, the least significant bit (LSB) of the result must be 1. This happens when one of the numbers is odd and the other is even.

2. **Counting Odd and Even Numbers**:
   - Traverse the list and count how many numbers are odd and how many are even.

3. **Forming Pairs**:
   - To form a pair with an odd XOR result, one number must be odd and the other must be even.
   - The number of such pairs is the product of the count of odd numbers and the count of even numbers.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize two counters: `odd_count` and `even_count` to zero.
2. Loop through each number in the list:
   - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.
   - If the number is even, increment `even_count`.
3. The result is the product of `odd_count` and `even_count`.
4. Return the result.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):
    # Initialize counters for odd and even numbers
    odd_count = 0
    even_count = 0
    
    # Count the number of odd and even numbers in the array
    for num in arr:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    # The number of pairs with an odd XOR is the product of odd_count and even_count
    return odd_count * even_count
```

This solution efficiently counts the number of odd and even numbers in the list and calculates the number of pairs with an odd XOR by multiplying these counts.
