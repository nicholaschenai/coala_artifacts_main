    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a cube. The function will take the length of one side of the cube as input and return the volume of the cube.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The volume of a cube can be calculated using the formula: \\( \\text{Volume} = \\text{side}^3 \\), where \"side\" is the length of one side of the cube. \n   - The function will take one argument, which is the side length of the cube, and return the result of raising this side length to the power of 3.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `volume_cube` that takes one parameter `side`.\n   - Calculate the volume by raising `side` to the power of 3.\n   - Return the calculated volume.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef volume_cube(side: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the volume of the cube by raising the side length to the power of 3\n    volume = side ** 3\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the volume of a cube given the side length, as demonstrated by the assertion `assert volume_cube(3) == 27`.",
