You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/234 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a cube. The function will take the length of one side of the cube as input and return the volume of the cube.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The volume of a cube can be calculated using the formula: \( \text{Volume} = \text{side}^3 \), where "side" is the length of one side of the cube. 
   - The function will take one argument, which is the side length of the cube, and return the result of raising this side length to the power of 3.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `volume_cube` that takes one parameter `side`.
   - Calculate the volume by raising `side` to the power of 3.
   - Return the calculated volume.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def volume_cube(side: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the volume of the cube by raising the side length to the power of 3
    volume = side ** 3
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
```

This function will correctly compute the volume of a cube given the side length, as demonstrated by the assertion `assert volume_cube(3) == 27`.
