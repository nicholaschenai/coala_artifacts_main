        "content": "\n## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if a given list of integers represents a min heap. A min heap is a binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes. In an array representation of a binary heap, for any element at index `i`, the left child is at index `2*i + 1` and the right child is at index `2*i + 2`. We need to check if this property holds for the entire array.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo check if the array represents a min heap, we need to verify that for every element at index `i`, the element is less than or equal to its left child (if it exists) and its right child (if it exists). We will iterate through each element in the array up to the last parent node and check these conditions.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `check_min_heap(arr)`.\n2. Get the length of the array `n`.\n3. Iterate over each index `i` from 0 to `n//2 - 1` (the last parent node):\n   - Calculate the left child index as `2*i + 1`.\n   - Calculate the right child index as `2*i + 2`.\n   - If the left child index is within bounds and `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[left]`, return `False`.\n   - If the right child index is within bounds and `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[right]`, return `False`.\n4. If all conditions are satisfied, return `True`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_min_heap(arr):\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # Iterate over each parent node\n    for i in range(n // 2):\n        # Calculate the left and right child indices\n        left = 2 * i + 1\n        right = 2 * i + 2\n        \n        # Check if the left child exists and is greater than the parent\n        if left < n and arr[i] > arr[left]:\n            return False\n        \n        # Check if the right child exists and is greater than the parent\n        if right < n and arr[i] > arr[right]:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all checks pass, the array is a min heap\n    return True\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the array, checking the min heap property for each parent node. If any parent node violates the min heap property, the function returns `False`. If all nodes satisfy the property, it returns `True`."
