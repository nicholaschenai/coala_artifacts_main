You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/421 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple as input and concatenates all its elements into a single string, with each element separated by a hyphen ("-").

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, convert each element of the tuple to a string, since tuples can contain elements of different types (e.g., integers, strings).
   - Then, join these string representations together using a hyphen as the delimiter.
   - Return the resulting concatenated string.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `concatenate_tuple` that takes a tuple `tup` as an argument.
   - Convert each element of `tup` to a string.
   - Use the `join` method with a hyphen as the delimiter to concatenate these string elements.
   - Return the concatenated string.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def concatenate_tuple(tup: tuple) -> str:
    # Convert each element of the tuple to a string
    string_elements = map(str, tup)
    
    # Join the string elements with a hyphen as the delimiter
    result = '-'.join(string_elements)
    
    # Return the concatenated string
    return result
```

This function will take a tuple, convert each element to a string, and then join them with a hyphen, returning the final concatenated string.

    result = '-'.join(string_elements)
