You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and removes all lowercase substrings from it. A lowercase substring is any sequence of consecutive lowercase letters. The function should return the modified string with only the non-lowercase parts.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.
   - We will build a new string by adding only those characters that are not lowercase.
   - If a character is uppercase or not a letter, it will be added to the new string.
   - Finally, we will return the new string which will have all lowercase substrings removed.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function remove_lowercase with parameter input_string
       Initialize an empty string result
       For each character in input_string
           If the character is not lowercase
               Append the character to result
       Return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def remove_lowercase(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to store the result
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character is not lowercase
        if not char.islower():
            # Append the character to the result if it is not lowercase
            result += char
    
    # Return the result string with all lowercase substrings removed
    return result
```

This function will iterate through the input string, check each character to see if it is lowercase, and build a new string with only the non-lowercase characters. This effectively removes all lowercase substrings from the input.

        # Check if the character is not lowercase
        if not char.islower():
            # Append the character to the result if it is not lowercase
            result += char
    
    # Return the result string with all lowercase substrings removed
    return result

            result += char
    
    # Return the result string with all lowercase substrings removed
    return result
```
