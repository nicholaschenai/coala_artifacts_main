The function should return a new list containing only the strings from the original list that have a length equal to the given integer.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each string in the input list.\n   - For each string, we will check if its length matches the specified integer.\n   - If the length matches, we will add the string to a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return this new list containing all the strings of the specified length.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function extract_string with parameters string_list and size\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each string in string_list\n           If the length of the string is equal to size\n               Append the string to result\n       Return result\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_string(string_list, size):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store strings of the specified length\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each string in the input list\n    for string in string_list:\n        # Check if the length of the current string matches the specified size\n        if len(string) == size:\n            # If it matches, add the string to the result list\n            result.append(string)\n    \n    # Return the list of strings that have the specified length\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly filter and return strings from the input list that have a length equal to the specified size."
