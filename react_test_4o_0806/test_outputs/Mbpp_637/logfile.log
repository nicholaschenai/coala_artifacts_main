You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/637 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if there is no profit and no loss given two amounts: the cost price and the selling price. If the selling price is equal to the cost price, it means there is no profit and no loss, and the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will compare the cost price and the selling price.
   - If the selling price is equal to the cost price, it means there is no profit and no loss, so we return `True`.
   - If the selling price is not equal to the cost price, it means there is either a profit or a loss, so we return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function noprofit_noloss(cost_price, selling_price):
       if cost_price is equal to selling_price:
           return True
       else:
           return False
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def noprofit_noloss(cost_price: int, selling_price: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the cost price is equal to the selling price
    if cost_price == selling_price:
        # If they are equal, there is no profit and no loss
        return True
    else:
        # If they are not equal, there is either a profit or a loss
        return False
```

This function takes two integer inputs, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns a boolean indicating whether there is no profit and no loss.

        return True
    else:
        # If they are not equal, there is either a profit or a loss
