    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if there is no profit and no loss given two amounts: the cost price and the selling price. If the selling price is equal to the cost price, it means there is no profit and no loss, and the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will compare the cost price and the selling price.\n   - If the selling price is equal to the cost price, it means there is no profit and no loss, so we return `True`.\n   - If the selling price is not equal to the cost price, it means there is either a profit or a loss, so we return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function noprofit_noloss(cost_price, selling_price):\n       if cost_price is equal to selling_price:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef noprofit_noloss(cost_price: int, selling_price: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the cost price is equal to the selling price\n    if cost_price == selling_price:\n        # If they are equal, there is no profit and no loss\n        return True\n    else:\n        # If they are not equal, there is either a profit or a loss\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function takes two integer inputs, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns a boolean indicating whether there is no profit and no loss.",
