You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/19 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine if a list of integers contains any duplicate values. If there are duplicates, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To find duplicates in a list, we can use a set to track the numbers we have already seen. As we iterate through the list, we check if the current number is already in the set. If it is, we have found a duplicate and return `True`. If it is not, we add the number to the set and continue. If we finish iterating through the list without finding any duplicates, we return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function test_duplicate(arr):
       create an empty set called seen_numbers
       for each number in arr:
           if number is in seen_numbers:
               return True
           else:
               add number to seen_numbers
       return False
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def test_duplicate(arr):
    # Create an empty set to keep track of numbers we have seen
    seen_numbers = set()
    
    # Iterate through each number in the array
    for number in arr:
        # If the number is already in the set, we found a duplicate
        if number in seen_numbers:
            return True
        # Otherwise, add the number to the set
        else:
            seen_numbers.add(number)
    
    # If we finish the loop without finding duplicates, return False
    return False
```

This solution efficiently checks for duplicates by leveraging the properties of a set, which allows for average O(1) time complexity for both membership checks and insertions.
