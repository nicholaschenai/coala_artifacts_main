        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to determine if a list of integers contains any duplicate values. If there are duplicates, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To find duplicates in a list, we can use a set to track the numbers we have already seen. As we iterate through the list, we check if the current number is already in the set. If it is, we have found a duplicate and return `True`. If it is not, we add the number to the set and continue. If we finish iterating through the list without finding any duplicates, we return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function test_duplicate(arr):\n       create an empty set called seen_numbers\n       for each number in arr:\n           if number is in seen_numbers:\n               return True\n           else:\n               add number to seen_numbers\n       return False\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef test_duplicate(arr):\n    # Create an empty set to keep track of numbers we have seen\n    seen_numbers = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        # If the number is already in the set, we found a duplicate\n        if number in seen_numbers:\n            return True\n        # Otherwise, add the number to the set\n        else:\n            seen_numbers.add(number)\n    \n    # If we finish the loop without finding duplicates, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently checks for duplicates by leveraging the properties of a set, which allows for average O(1) time complexity for both membership checks and insertions."
