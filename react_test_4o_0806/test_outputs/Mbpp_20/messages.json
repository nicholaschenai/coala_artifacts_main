        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given number is a Woodall number. A Woodall number is defined as a number of the form \\( n \\times 2^n - 1 \\) for some integer \\( n \\geq 1 \\). The function should return `True` if the input number is a Woodall number and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if a number is a Woodall number, we can iterate over possible values of \\( n \\) starting from 1. For each \\( n \\), we calculate the Woodall number using the formula \\( n \\times 2^n - 1 \\). If this calculated number matches the input number, then the input is a Woodall number, and we return `True`. If the calculated number exceeds the input number, we can stop the iteration and return `False` since Woodall numbers increase as \\( n \\) increases.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function is_woodall(x):\n       n = 1\n       while True:\n           calculate woodall_number = n * 2^n - 1\n           if woodall_number == x:\n               return True\n           if woodall_number > x:\n               return False\n           increment n by 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_woodall(x: int) -> bool:\n    # Start with n = 1\n    n = 1\n    while True:\n        # Calculate the Woodall number for the current n\n        woodall_number = n * (2 ** n) - 1\n        # Check if the calculated Woodall number matches the input number\n        if woodall_number == x:\n            return True\n        # If the calculated Woodall number exceeds the input number, stop and return False\n        if woodall_number > x:\n            return False\n        # Increment n to check the next possible Woodall number\n        n += 1\n```\n\nThis code will correctly determine if a given number is a Woodall number by iterating through possible values of \\( n \\) and checking if the formula \\( n \\times 2^n - 1 \\) matches the input number."
