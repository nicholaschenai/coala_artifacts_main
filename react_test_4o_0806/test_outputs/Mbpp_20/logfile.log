You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/20 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given number is a Woodall number. A Woodall number is defined as a number of the form \( n \times 2^n - 1 \) for some integer \( n \geq 1 \). The function should return `True` if the input number is a Woodall number and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To determine if a number is a Woodall number, we can iterate over possible values of \( n \) starting from 1. For each \( n \), we calculate the Woodall number using the formula \( n \times 2^n - 1 \). If this calculated number matches the input number, then the input is a Woodall number, and we return `True`. If the calculated number exceeds the input number, we can stop the iteration and return `False` since Woodall numbers increase as \( n \) increases.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function is_woodall(x):
       n = 1
       while True:
           calculate woodall_number = n * 2^n - 1
           if woodall_number == x:
               return True
           if woodall_number > x:
               return False
           increment n by 1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_woodall(x: int) -> bool:
    # Start with n = 1
    n = 1
    while True:
        # Calculate the Woodall number for the current n
        woodall_number = n * (2 ** n) - 1
        # Check if the calculated Woodall number matches the input number
        if woodall_number == x:
            return True
        # If the calculated Woodall number exceeds the input number, stop and return False
        if woodall_number > x:
            return False
        # Increment n to check the next possible Woodall number
        n += 1
```

This code will correctly determine if a given number is a Woodall number by iterating through possible values of \( n \) and checking if the formula \( n \times 2^n - 1 \) matches the input number.
