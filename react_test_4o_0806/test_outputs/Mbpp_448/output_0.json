    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the first `n` Perrin numbers. The Perrin sequence is defined as follows:\n   - P(0) = 3\n   - P(1) = 0\n   - P(2) = 2\n   - For n \u2265 3, P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Initialize a list to store the first three Perrin numbers: 3, 0, and 2.\n   - Use a loop to calculate the subsequent Perrin numbers up to the nth number using the formula P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3).\n   - Accumulate the sum of these numbers as we generate them.\n   - Return the accumulated sum once we have generated the first `n` numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a list `perrin` with the first three Perrin numbers: [3, 0, 2]\n   Initialize a variable `sum_perrin` with the sum of the first three numbers: 5\n\n   If n is less than or equal to 3, return the sum of the first `n` numbers in the list\n\n   For i from 3 to n-1:\n       Calculate the next Perrin number as perrin[i-2] + perrin[i-3]\n       Append this number to the `perrin` list\n       Add this number to `sum_perrin`\n\n   Return `sum_perrin`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef cal_sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the first three Perrin numbers\n    perrin = [3, 0, 2]\n    # Calculate the initial sum of the first three numbers\n    sum_perrin = sum(perrin[:n])  # Only sum up to n if n < 3\n\n    # If n is less than or equal to 3, return the sum of the first n numbers\n    if n <= 3:\n        return sum_perrin\n\n    # Calculate the rest of the Perrin numbers up to the nth number\n    for i in range(3, n):\n        # Calculate the next Perrin number\n        next_perrin = perrin[i-2] + perrin[i-3]\n        # Append the new number to the list\n        perrin.append(next_perrin)\n        # Add the new number to the sum\n        sum_perrin += next_perrin\n\n    # Return the total sum of the first n Perrin numbers\n    return sum_perrin\n```\n\nThis code calculates the sum of the first `n` Perrin numbers by iteratively generating each number in the sequence and accumulating their sum.",
