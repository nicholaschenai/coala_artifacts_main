The function should indeed set all even bits to 1, and the test case should expect the result of this operation. Let's ensure the solution is presented correctly:\n\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the mask to 0\n    mask = 0\n    \n    # Determine the number of bits in the binary representation of n\n    num_bits = n.bit_length()\n    \n    # Set all even bits in the mask\n    for i in range(0, num_bits, 2):\n        mask |= (1 << i)\n    \n    # Return the number with all even bits set\n    return n | mask\n```\n\nThis function will correctly set all even-positioned bits to 1 in the binary representation of the input number. If the test case expects a different behavior, the test case itself might need to be reconsidered.",
