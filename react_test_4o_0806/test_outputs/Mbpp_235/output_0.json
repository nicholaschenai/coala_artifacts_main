    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nThe task is to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns a new integer where all the even-positioned bits (0-indexed) in the binary representation of the input number are set to 1. The function should be named `even_bit_set_number`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Bit Positions**: In binary representation, bits are indexed from right to left starting at 0. So, the even-positioned bits are at indices 0, 2, 4, etc.\n\n2. **Set Even Bits**: To set a bit means to change it to 1. We need to ensure that all even-positioned bits in the binary representation of the number are set to 1.\n\n3. **Create a Mask**: We can create a binary mask where all even bits are set to 1. For example, for a 4-bit number, the mask would be `0101` (binary) or `5` (decimal).\n\n4. **Apply the Mask**: Use the bitwise OR operation to set the even bits of the input number. The OR operation will set a bit to 1 if either of the corresponding bits in the operands is 1.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: The result of the OR operation will be the number with all even bits set to 1.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a variable `mask` to 0.\n2. For each even bit position `i` from 0 to the maximum bit length of the input number:\n   - Set the bit at position `i` in `mask` to 1.\n3. Return the result of the bitwise OR operation between the input number and `mask`.\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the mask to 0\n    mask = 0\n    \n    # Determine the number of bits in the binary representation of n\n    num_bits = n.bit_length()\n    \n    # Set all even bits in the mask\n    for i in range(0, num_bits, 2):\n        mask |= (1 << i)\n    \n    # Return the number with all even bits set\n    return n | mask\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We first calculate the number of bits required to represent the input number using `n.bit_length()`.\n- We then iterate over all even indices up to this bit length, setting the corresponding bit in the `mask` using the bitwise OR operation `mask |= (1 << i)`.\n- Finally, we return the result of `n | mask`, which ensures all even bits in `n` are set to 1.",
