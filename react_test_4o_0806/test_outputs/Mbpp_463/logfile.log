INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/463 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within a given array of integers. A subarray is a sequence of consecutive elements from the array. The task is to identify the subarray that yields the highest product when its elements are multiplied together.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing three variables: `max_product` to store the maximum product found so far, `current_max` to store the maximum product ending at the current position, and `current_min` to store the minimum product ending at the current position. The `current_min` is necessary because a negative number multiplied by a negative `current_min` can become a positive number, potentially leading to a new maximum product.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: Loop through each element in the array. For each element:
   - If the element is negative, swap `current_max` and `current_min` because multiplying by a negative number will flip the sign.
   - Update `current_max` to be the maximum of the current element itself or the product of `current_max` and the current element.
   - Update `current_min` to be the minimum of the current element itself or the product of `current_min` and the current element.
   - Update `max_product` to be the maximum of `max_product` and `current_max`.

3. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the array, `max_product` will contain the maximum product of any subarray.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_subarray_product(arr):
    if arr is empty:
        return 0
    
    max_product = arr[0]
    current_max = arr[0]
    current_min = arr[0]
    
    for each element num in arr starting from index 1:
        if num is negative:
            swap current_max and current_min
        
        current_max = max(num, current_max * num)
        current_min = min(num, current_min * num)
        
        max_product = max(max_product, current_max)
    
    return max_product
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def max_subarray_product(arr):
    if not arr:
        return 0
    
    max_product = arr[0]
    current_max = arr[0]
    current_min = arr[0]
    
    for num in arr[1:]:
        if num < 0:
            current_max, current_min = current_min, current_max
        
        current_max = max(num, current_max * num)
        current_min = min(num, current_min * num)
        
        max_product = max(max_product, current_max)
    
    return max_product
```

This solution efficiently finds the maximum product subarray by maintaining running products and adjusting for negative numbers, ensuring that the maximum product is updated correctly as we iterate through the array.
