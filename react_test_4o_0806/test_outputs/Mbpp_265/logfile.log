You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/265 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer `n` as inputs. The function should split the list into `n` separate lists, where each list contains every `n`-th element from the original list, starting from different initial positions. The result should be a list of these `n` lists.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize `n` empty lists**: We will create a list of `n` empty lists to store the results.
2. **Iterate through the original list**: For each element in the original list, determine which of the `n` lists it should go into.
3. **Distribute elements**: Use the index of the element modulo `n` to decide which of the `n` lists the element should be appended to.
4. **Return the list of lists**: After processing all elements, return the list containing the `n` lists.

## Pseudocode

1. Create a list `result` containing `n` empty lists.
2. For each index `i` and element `elem` in the input list:
   - Determine the target list index as `i % n`.
   - Append `elem` to `result[i % n]`.
3. Return `result`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def list_split(lst, n):
    # Step 1: Initialize a list of n empty lists
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Step 2: Iterate over the input list with index
    for i, elem in enumerate(lst):
        # Step 3: Append the element to the appropriate sublist
        result[i % n].append(elem)
    
    # Step 4: Return the list of lists
    return result
```

This solution efficiently distributes elements from the input list into `n` separate lists based on their index, ensuring that each list contains every `n`-th element from the original list.
