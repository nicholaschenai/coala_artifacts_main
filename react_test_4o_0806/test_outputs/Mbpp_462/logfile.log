1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of elements and returns all possible combinations (subsets) of those elements. The combinations should include the empty set and all possible non-empty subsets of the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find all possible combinations of a list, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to build combinations by either including or excluding each element of the list. We start with an empty combination and for each element, we create new combinations by adding the element to existing combinations. This way, we explore all possible subsets.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function `combinations_list` that takes a list `elements`.
   Initialize a list `result` with an empty list to store all combinations.
   
   Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes `current_combination` and `index`.
       If `index` is equal to the length of `elements`, add `current_combination` to `result`.
       Otherwise:
           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` and `index + 1` (exclude current element).
           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` + [elements[index]] and `index + 1` (include current element).
   
   Call `generate_combinations` with an empty list and index 0.
   Return `result`.
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations
    result = []
    
    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If we've considered all elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
        else:
            # Exclude the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)
            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    return result
```

This solution uses a recursive approach to explore all possible subsets of the input list by considering each element in two ways: included in the current subset or excluded from it. The base case of the recursion is when all elements have been considered, at which point the current subset is added to the result list.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Identify the Problem:**

   The code is generating all possible combinations correctly, but the order of the combinations does not match the expected output. The expected output seems to require combinations to be generated in a specific order based on the order of elements in the input list.

2. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**

   The current implementation generates combinations in a lexicographical order based on the recursive calls, which results in combinations being ordered by the last element added. However, the expected output requires combinations to be ordered by the first element added, which means we need to generate combinations in a different order.

### Solution Adjustment

To fix the order of the combinations, we need to ensure that combinations are generated by considering elements in the order they appear in the input list. This means that when we include an element in a combination, it should be added in the order of the input list, not based on the recursive call order.

### Revised Solution

Let's adjust the code to ensure the combinations are generated in the correct order:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations
    result = []
    
    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # Add the current combination to the result
        result.append(current_combination)
        
        # Iterate over the remaining elements to generate new combinations
        for i in range(index, len(elements)):
            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[i]], i + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Initialization:** We start with an empty list `result` to store all combinations.
- **Recursive Function:** The `generate_combinations` function is used to explore all subsets.
  - **Base Case:** Every time we call the function, we add the current combination to the result.
  - **Recursive Case:** We iterate over the elements starting from the current index, adding each element to the current combination and recursively generating further combinations.
- **Order Maintenance:** By iterating from the current index to the end of the list, we ensure that elements are added in the order they appear in the input list, maintaining the required order of combinations.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of elements and returns all possible combinations (subsets) of those elements. The combinations should include the empty set and all possible non-empty subsets of the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find all possible combinations of a list, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to build combinations by either including or excluding each element of the list. We start with an empty combination and for each element, we create new combinations by adding the element to existing combinations. This way, we explore all possible subsets.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function `combinations_list` that takes a list `elements`.
   Initialize a list `result` with an empty list to store all combinations.
   
   Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes `current_combination` and `index`.
       If `index` is equal to the length of `elements`, add `current_combination` to `result`.
       Otherwise:
           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` and `index + 1` (exclude current element).
           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` + [elements[index]] and `index + 1` (include current element).
   
   Call `generate_combinations` with an empty list and index 0.
   Return `result`.
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations
    result = []
    
    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If we've considered all elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
        else:
            # Exclude the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)
            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    return result
```

This solution uses a recursive approach to explore all possible subsets of the input list by considering each element in two ways: included in the current subset or excluded from it. The base case of the recursion is when all elements have been considered, at which point the current subset is added to the result list.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Identify the Problem:**

   The code is generating all possible combinations correctly, but the order of the combinations does not match the expected output. The expected output seems to require combinations to be generated in a specific order based on the order of elements in the input list.

2. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**

   The current implementation generates combinations in a lexicographical order based on the recursive calls, which results in combinations being ordered by the last element added. However, the expected output requires combinations to be ordered by the first element added, which means we need to generate combinations in a different order.

### Solution Adjustment

To fix the order of the combinations, we need to ensure that combinations are generated by considering elements in the order they appear in the input list. This means that when we include an element in a combination, it should be added in the order of the input list, not based on the recursive call order.

### Revised Solution

Let's adjust the code to ensure the combinations are generated in the correct order:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations
    result = []
    
    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # Add the current combination to the result
        result.append(current_combination)
        
        # Iterate over the remaining elements to generate new combinations
        for i in range(index, len(elements)):
            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[i]], i + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Initialization:** We start with an empty list `result` to store all combinations.
- **Recursive Function:** The `generate_combinations` function is used to explore all subsets.
  - **Base Case:** Every time we call the function, we add the current combination to the result.
  - **Recursive Case:** We iterate over the elements starting from the current index, adding each element to the current combination and recursively generating further combinations.
- **Order Maintenance:** By iterating from the current index to the end of the list, we ensure that elements are added in the order they appear in the input list, maintaining the required order of combinations.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Identify the Problem:**

   The code is generating all possible combinations correctly, but the order of the combinations does not match the expected output. The expected output requires combinations to be ordered by the number of elements in each subset, and then by the order of elements in the input list.

2. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**

   The current implementation generates combinations in a lexicographical order based on the recursive calls, which results in combinations being ordered by the sequence of elements added. However, the expected output requires combinations to be ordered first by size (number of elements) and then by the order of elements in the input list.

### Solution Adjustment

To fix the order of the combinations, we need to ensure that combinations are sorted by their length first, and then by the order of elements as they appear in the input list.

### Revised Solution

Let's adjust the code to ensure the combinations are generated in the correct order:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations
    result = []
    
    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # Add the current combination to the result
        result.append(current_combination)
        
        # Iterate over the remaining elements to generate new combinations
        for i in range(index, len(elements)):
            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[i]], i + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    # Sort the result by the length of the combinations and then lexicographically
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
    
    return result
```

- **Initialization:** We start with an empty list `result` to store all combinations.
- **Recursive Function:** The `generate_combinations` function is used to explore all subsets.
  - **Base Case:** Every time we call the function, we add the current combination to the result.
  - **Recursive Case:** We iterate over the elements starting from the current index, adding each element to the current combination and recursively generating further combinations.
- **Order Maintenance:** After generating all combinations, we sort the result list by the length of each combination and then lexicographically to ensure the correct order as required by the problem statement.

```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Initialization:** We start with an empty list `result` to store all combinations.
- **Recursive Function:** The `generate_combinations` function is used to explore all subsets.
  - **Base Case:** Every time we call the function, we add the current combination to the result.
  - **Recursive Case:** We iterate over the elements starting from the current index, adding each element to the current combination and recursively generating further combinations.
- **Order Maintenance:** After generating all combinations, we sort the result list by the length of each combination and then lexicographically to ensure the correct order as required by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of elements and returns all possible combinations (subsets) of those elements. The combinations should include the empty set and all possible non-empty subsets of the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find all possible combinations of a list, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to build combinations by either including or excluding each element of the list. We start with an empty combination and for each element, we create new combinations by adding the element to existing combinations. This way, we explore all possible subsets.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function `combinations_list` that takes a list `elements`.
   Initialize a list `result` with an empty list to store all combinations.
   
   Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes `current_combination` and `index`.
       If `index` is equal to the length of `elements`, add `current_combination` to `result`.
       Otherwise:
           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` and `index + 1` (exclude current element).
           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` + [elements[index]] and `index + 1` (include current element).
   
   Call `generate_combinations` with an empty list and index 0.
   Return `result`.
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations
    result = []
    
    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If we've considered all elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
        else:
            # Exclude the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)
            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    return result
```

This solution uses a recursive approach to explore all possible subsets of the input list by considering each element in two ways: included in the current subset or excluded from it. The base case of the recursion is when all elements have been considered, at which point the current subset is added to the result list.

## Instructions

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Identify the Problem:**

   The code is generating all possible combinations correctly, but the order of the combinations does not match the expected output. The expected output seems to require combinations to be generated in a specific order based on the order of elements in the input list.

2. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**

   The current implementation generates combinations in a lexicographical order based on the recursive calls, which results in combinations being ordered by the last element added. However, the expected output requires combinations to be ordered by the first element added, which means we need to generate combinations in a different order.

### Solution Adjustment

To fix the order of the combinations, we need to ensure that combinations are generated by considering elements in the order they appear in the input list. This means that when we include an element in a combination, it should be added in the order of the input list, not based on the recursive call order.

### Revised Solution

Let's adjust the code to ensure the combinations are generated in the correct order:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations
    result = []
    
    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # Add the current combination to the result
        result.append(current_combination)
        
        # Iterate over the remaining elements to generate new combinations
        for i in range(index, len(elements)):
            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[i]], i + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Initialization:** We start with an empty list `result` to store all combinations.
- **Recursive Function:** The `generate_combinations` function is used to explore all subsets.
  - **Base Case:** Every time we call the function, we add the current combination to the result.
  - **Recursive Case:** We iterate over the elements starting from the current index, adding each element to the current combination and recursively generating further combinations.
- **Order Maintenance:** By iterating from the current index to the end of the list, we ensure that elements are added in the order they appear in the input list, maintaining the required order of combinations.

1. **Identify the Problem:**

   The code is generating all possible combinations correctly, but the order of the combinations does not match the expected output. The expected output requires combinations to be ordered by the number of elements in each subset, and then by the order of elements in the input list.

2. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**

   The current implementation generates combinations in a lexicographical order based on the recursive calls, which results in combinations being ordered by the sequence of elements added. However, the expected output requires combinations to be ordered first by size (number of elements) and then by the order of elements in the input list.

### Solution Adjustment

To fix the order of the combinations, we need to ensure that combinations are sorted by their length first, and then by the order of elements as they appear in the input list.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Identify the Problem:**

   The code is generating all possible combinations and sorting them by length and lexicographically. However, the expected output requires a specific order that is not purely lexicographical. The expected order seems to be based on the order of elements in the input list, with subsets being ordered by the first element, then the second, and so on.

2. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**

   The sorting step is not aligning with the expected order of combinations. The expected output requires combinations to be ordered by the first element, then the second, and so on, rather than by length or lexicographical order.

### Solution Adjustment

To fix the order of the combinations, we need to ensure that combinations are generated in the order of the input list, without additional sorting. The recursive generation should naturally produce the required order if we handle the inclusion and exclusion of elements correctly.

### Revised Solution

Let's adjust the code to ensure the combinations are generated in the correct order:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations

        # Add the current combination to the result

        # Iterate over the remaining elements to generate new combinations

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of elements and returns all possible combinations (subsets) of those elements. The combinations should include the empty set and all possible non-empty subsets of the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

   To find all possible combinations of a list, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to build combinations by either including or excluding each element of the list. We start with an empty combination and for each element, we create new combinations by adding the element to existing combinations. This way, we explore all possible subsets.

### Pseudocode

   ```
   Define a function `combinations_list` that takes a list `elements`.
   Initialize a list `result` with an empty list to store all combinations.
   
   Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes `current_combination` and `index`.
       If `index` is equal to the length of `elements`, add `current_combination` to `result`.
       Otherwise:
           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` and `index + 1` (exclude current element).
           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` + [elements[index]] and `index + 1` (include current element).

            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    return result
```

This solution uses a recursive approach to explore all possible subsets of the input list by considering each element in two ways: included in the current subset or excluded from it. The base case of the recursion is when all elements have been considered, at which point the current subset is added to the result list.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Identify the Problem:**

   The code is generating all possible combinations correctly, but the order of the combinations does not match the expected output. The expected output seems to require combinations to be generated in a specific order based on the order of elements in the input list.

2. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**

   The current implementation generates combinations in a lexicographical order based on the recursive calls, which results in combinations being ordered by the last element added. However, the expected output requires combinations to be ordered by the first element added, which means we need to generate combinations in a different order.

### Solution Adjustment

To fix the order of the combinations, we need to ensure that combinations are generated by considering elements in the order they appear in the input list. This means that when we include an element in a combination, it should be added in the order of the input list, not based on the recursive call order.

### Revised Solution

Let's adjust the code to ensure the combinations are generated in the correct order:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations
    result = []
    
    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # Add the current combination to the result
        result.append(current_combination)
        
        # Iterate over the remaining elements to generate new combinations
        for i in range(index, len(elements)):
            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[i]], i + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution

- **Initialization:** We start with an empty list `result` to store all combinations.
- **Recursive Function:** The `generate_combinations` function is used to explore all subsets.
  - **Base Case:** Every time we call the function, we add the current combination to the result.
  - **Recursive Case:** We iterate over the elements starting from the current index, adding each element to the current combination and recursively generating further combinations.
- **Order Maintenance:** By iterating from the current index to the end of the list, we ensure that elements are added in the order they appear in the input list, maintaining the required order of combinations.

1. **Identify the Problem:**

   The code is generating all possible combinations correctly, but the order of the combinations does not match the expected output. The expected output requires combinations to be ordered by the number of elements in each subset, and then by the order of elements in the input list.

2. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**

   The current implementation generates combinations in a lexicographical order based on the recursive calls, which results in combinations being ordered by the sequence of elements added. However, the expected output requires combinations to be ordered first by size (number of elements) and then by the order of elements in the input list.

### Solution Adjustment

To fix the order of the combinations, we need to ensure that combinations are sorted by their length first, and then by the order of elements as they appear in the input list.

### Revised Solution

Let's adjust the code to ensure the combinations are generated in the correct order:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations
    result = []
    
    # Helper function to generate combinations

        # Add the current combination to the result

        # Iterate over the remaining elements to generate new combinations
        for i in range(index, len(elements)):
            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[i]], i + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    # Sort the result by the length of the combinations and then lexicographically
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
    
    return result
```

- **Recursive Function:** The `generate_combinations` function is used to explore all subsets.
  - **Base Case:** Every time we call the function, we add the current combination to the result.
  - **Recursive Case:** We iterate over the elements starting from the current index, adding each element to the current combination and recursively generating further combinations.
- **Order Maintenance:** After generating all combinations, we sort the result list by the length of each combination and then lexicographically to ensure the correct order as required by the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Issue

1. **Identify the Problem:**

   The code is generating all possible combinations and sorting them by length and lexicographically. However, the expected output requires a specific order that is not purely lexicographical. The expected order seems to be based on the order of elements in the input list, with subsets being ordered by the first element, then the second, and so on.

2. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**

   The sorting step is not aligning with the expected order of combinations. The expected output requires combinations to be ordered by the first element, then the second, and so on, rather than by length or lexicographical order.

### Solution Adjustment

To fix the order of the combinations, we need to ensure that combinations are generated in the order of the input list, without additional sorting. The recursive generation should naturally produce the required order if we handle the inclusion and exclusion of elements correctly.

### Revised Solution

Let's adjust the code to ensure the combinations are generated in the correct order:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations
    result = []

    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # Add the current combination to the result
        result.append(current_combination)
        
        # Iterate over the remaining elements to generate new combinations
        for i in range(index, len(elements)):
            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[i]], i + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
