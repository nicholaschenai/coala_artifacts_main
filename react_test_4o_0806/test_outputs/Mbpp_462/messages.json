        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of elements and returns all possible combinations (subsets) of those elements. The combinations should include the empty set and all possible non-empty subsets of the list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find all possible combinations of a list, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to build combinations by either including or excluding each element of the list. We start with an empty combination and for each element, we create new combinations by adding the element to existing combinations. This way, we explore all possible subsets.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function `combinations_list` that takes a list `elements`.\n   Initialize a list `result` with an empty list to store all combinations.\n   \n   Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes `current_combination` and `index`.\n       If `index` is equal to the length of `elements`, add `current_combination` to `result`.\n       Otherwise:\n           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` and `index + 1` (exclude current element).\n           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` + [elements[index]] and `index + 1` (include current element).\n   \n   Call `generate_combinations` with an empty list and index 0.\n   Return `result`.\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef combinations_list(elements):\n    # This will store all the combinations\n    result = []\n    \n    # Helper function to generate combinations\n    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):\n        # If we've considered all elements, add the current combination to the result\n        if index == len(elements):\n            result.append(current_combination)\n        else:\n            # Exclude the current element and move to the next\n            generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)\n            # Include the current element and move to the next\n            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)\n    \n    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0\n    generate_combinations([], 0)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive approach to explore all possible subsets of the input list by considering each element in two ways: included in the current subset or excluded from it. The base case of the recursion is when all elements have been considered, at which point the current subset is added to the result list."
