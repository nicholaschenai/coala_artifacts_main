    "raw_msg": "Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.\n\n### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe are given two lists of the same length. Our task is to count how many indices have the same value in both lists.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can iterate through both lists simultaneously and compare the elements at each index. We will maintain a counter to keep track of how many times the elements at the same index in both lists are equal. Finally, we will return this counter as the result.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\n1. Initialize a counter to 0.\n2. Loop through the indices of the lists:\n   a. If the element at the current index in the first list is equal to the element at the same index in the second list, increment the counter.\n3. After the loop ends, return the counter.\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of matching indices\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in both lists\n        if list1[i] == list2[i]:\n            # Increment the counter if they are the same\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of matching indices\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of indices where the two lists have the same values, as required by the problem statement.",
