You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/723 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We are given two lists of the same length. Our task is to count how many indices have the same value in both lists.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can iterate through both lists simultaneously and compare the elements at each index. We will maintain a counter to keep track of how many times the elements at the same index in both lists are equal. Finally, we will return this counter as the result.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
1. Initialize a counter to 0.
2. Loop through the indices of the lists:
   a. If the element at the current index in the first list is equal to the element at the same index in the second list, increment the counter.
3. After the loop ends, return the counter.
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def count_same_pair(list1, list2):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of matching indices
    count = 0
    
    # Loop through the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in both lists
        if list1[i] == list2[i]:
            # Increment the counter if they are the same
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of matching indices
    return count
```

This function will correctly count the number of indices where the two lists have the same values, as required by the problem statement.
