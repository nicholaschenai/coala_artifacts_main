You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/422 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should take an integer `n` as input and return the average of the cubes of numbers from 1 to `n`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Range**: The first `n` natural numbers are the integers from 1 to `n`.
2. **Cube Each Number**: For each number in this range, calculate its cube.
3. **Sum the Cubes**: Add up all the cubes.
4. **Calculate the Average**: Divide the sum of the cubes by `n` to get the average.
5. **Return the Result**: The function should return this average.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_Average_Of_Cube(n):
    initialize sum_of_cubes to 0
    for each number i from 1 to n:
        add i^3 to sum_of_cubes
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_Average_Of_Cube(n: int) -> float:
    # Initialize the sum of cubes to 0
    sum_of_cubes = 0
    
    # Loop through each number from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Add the cube of the current number to the sum
        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3
    
    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum of cubes by n
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    
    # Return the calculated average
    return average
```
