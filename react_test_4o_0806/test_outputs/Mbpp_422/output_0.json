    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a Python function that calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should take an integer `n` as input and return the average of the cubes of numbers from 1 to `n`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Range**: The first `n` natural numbers are the integers from 1 to `n`.\n2. **Cube Each Number**: For each number in this range, calculate its cube.\n3. **Sum the Cubes**: Add up all the cubes.\n4. **Calculate the Average**: Divide the sum of the cubes by `n` to get the average.\n5. **Return the Result**: The function should return this average.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_Average_Of_Cube(n):\n    initialize sum_of_cubes to 0\n    for each number i from 1 to n:\n        add i^3 to sum_of_cubes\n    average = sum_of_cubes / n\n    return average\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_Average_Of_Cube(n: int) -> float:\n    # Initialize the sum of cubes to 0\n    sum_of_cubes = 0\n    \n    # Loop through each number from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Add the cube of the current number to the sum\n        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3\n    \n    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum of cubes by n\n    average = sum_of_cubes / n\n    \n    # Return the calculated average\n    return average\n```",
