INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the sum of the first element of one tuple and the second element of another tuple from the input list. The order of the tuples in the output list should be based on the order of the sums.

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over each tuple in the input list.
   - For each tuple, we will pair its first element with the second element of every other tuple in the list.
   - We will calculate the sum of these paired elements and store them as tuples in a new list.
   - Finally, we will return the list of these sum tuples.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function find_combinations(tuple_list):
       initialize an empty list called result
       for each tuple1 in tuple_list:
           for each tuple2 in tuple_list:
               if tuple1 is not the same as tuple2:
                   calculate the sum of the first element of tuple1 and the second element of tuple2
                   append the sum as a tuple to the result list
       return the result list
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        # Get the first element of the current tuple
        first_element = tuple_list[i][0]
        
        # Iterate over each tuple again to pair with the current tuple
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not pairing the tuple with itself
            if i != j:
                # Get the second element of the other tuple
                second_element = tuple_list[j][1]
                
                # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
                # and the second element of the other tuple

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Identify the Issue:**

   The current implementation is incorrect because it calculates the sum of the first element of one tuple with the second element of every other tuple, including itself. This results in incorrect sums and more combinations than expected.

2. **Understanding the Expected Output:**

   The expected output is a list of tuples where each tuple is formed by summing the first element of one tuple with the second element of another tuple, but only for specific pairs. The expected output suggests that not all possible combinations are needed, but rather a specific subset.

3. **Re-evaluate the Problem Statement:**

   Upon closer inspection, the expected output seems to suggest a specific pairing order. The expected result is not all possible combinations but rather a specific sequence of sums.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

- We need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the next tuple in the list, wrapping around to the start if necessary.
- Specifically, for a list of tuples `[(a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h)]`, the expected pairs are:
  - `(a + d)`
  - `(c + f)`
  - `(e + h)`
  - `(g + b)`
  - `(a + f)`
  - `(c + h)`

### Corrected Pseudocode

```
function find_combinations(tuple_list):
    initialize an empty list called result
    get the length of the tuple_list as n
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+1) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+2) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list
    return the result list
```

### Corrected Python Solution

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Get the length of the tuple list
    n = len(tuple_list)
    
    # First pass: pair each first element with the second element of the next tuple
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
        # and the second element of the next tuple (with wrap-around)
        sum_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[(i+1) % n][1],)
        
        # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
        result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Second pass: pair each first element with the second element of the tuple two places ahead
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
        # and the second element of the tuple two places ahead (with wrap-around)
        sum_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[(i+2) % n][1],)
        
        # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
        result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of sum tuples
    return result
```

This solution should now correctly produce the expected output by following the specific pairing pattern observed in the expected result.

### Corrected Pseudocode

function find_combinations(tuple_list):

    get the length of the tuple_list as n
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+1) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list

### Corrected Python Solution

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Get the length of the tuple list
    n = len(tuple_list)
    
    # First pass: pair each first element with the second element of the next tuple
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
        # and the second element of the next tuple (with wrap-around)
        sum_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[(i+1) % n][1],)
        
        # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
        result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Second pass: pair each first element with the second element of the tuple two places ahead
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
        # and the second element of the tuple two places ahead (with wrap-around)
        sum_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[(i+2) % n][1],)
        
        # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
        result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of sum tuples
    return result
```

This solution should now correctly produce the expected output by following the specific pairing pattern observed in the expected result.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the sum of the first element of one tuple and the second element of another tuple from the input list. The order of the tuples in the output list should be based on the order of the sums.

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over each tuple in the input list.
   - For each tuple, we will pair its first element with the second element of every other tuple in the list.
   - We will calculate the sum of these paired elements and store them as tuples in a new list.
   - Finally, we will return the list of these sum tuples.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function find_combinations(tuple_list):
       initialize an empty list called result
       for each tuple1 in tuple_list:
           for each tuple2 in tuple_list:
               if tuple1 is not the same as tuple2:
                   calculate the sum of the first element of tuple1 and the second element of tuple2
                   append the sum as a tuple to the result list
       return the result list
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        # Get the first element of the current tuple
        first_element = tuple_list[i][0]
        
        # Iterate over each tuple again to pair with the current tuple
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not pairing the tuple with itself
            if i != j:
                # Get the second element of the other tuple
                second_element = tuple_list[j][1]
                
                # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
                # and the second element of the other tuple
                sum_tuple = (first_element + second_element,)
                
                # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
                result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of sum tuples
    return result
```

This code will correctly compute the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Identify the Issue:**

   The current implementation is incorrect because it calculates the sum of the first element of one tuple with the second element of every other tuple, including itself. This results in incorrect sums and more combinations than expected.

2. **Understanding the Expected Output:**

   The expected output is a list of tuples where each tuple is formed by summing the first element of one tuple with the second element of another tuple, but only for specific pairs. The expected output suggests that not all possible combinations are needed, but rather a specific subset.

3. **Re-evaluate the Problem Statement:**

   Upon closer inspection, the expected output seems to suggest a specific pairing order. The expected result is not all possible combinations but rather a specific sequence of sums.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

- We need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the next tuple in the list, wrapping around to the start if necessary.
- Specifically, for a list of tuples `[(a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h)]`, the expected pairs are:
  - `(a + d)`
  - `(c + f)`
  - `(e + h)`
  - `(g + b)`
  - `(a + f)`
  - `(c + h)`

### Corrected Pseudocode

```
function find_combinations(tuple_list):
    initialize an empty list called result
    get the length of the tuple_list as n
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+1) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+2) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list
    return the result list
```

### Corrected Python Solution

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Get the length of the tuple list
    n = len(tuple_list)
    
    # First pass: pair each first element with the second element of the next tuple
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
        # and the second element of the next tuple (with wrap-around)
        sum_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[(i+1) % n][1],)
        
        # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
        result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Second pass: pair each first element with the second element of the tuple two places ahead
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
        # and the second element of the tuple two places ahead (with wrap-around)
        sum_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[(i+2) % n][1],)
        
        # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
        result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of sum tuples
    return result
```

1. **Identify the Issue:**

   The current implementation is still incorrect because it does not produce the expected output. The expected output suggests a specific pairing pattern that was not correctly identified in the previous solution.

2. **Understanding the Expected Output:**

   The expected output is a list of tuples where each tuple is formed by summing the first element of one tuple with the second element of another tuple. The specific pairs are not all possible combinations but rather a specific subset.

3. **Re-evaluate the Problem Statement:**

   The expected output suggests that the pairs are formed by:
   - Pairing the first element of the first tuple with the second element of the second tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the second tuple with the second element of the third tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the third tuple with the second element of the fourth tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the fourth tuple with the second element of the first tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the first tuple with the second element of the third tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the second tuple with the second element of the fourth tuple.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

- We need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the next tuple in the list, wrapping around to the start if necessary.
- Additionally, we need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the tuple two places ahead, wrapping around if necessary.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Identify the Issue:**

   The current implementation is incorrect because it calculates the sum of the first element of one tuple with the second element of every other tuple, including itself. This results in incorrect sums and more combinations than expected.

2. **Understanding the Expected Output:**

   The expected output is a list of tuples where each tuple is formed by summing the first element of one tuple with the second element of another tuple, but only for specific pairs. The expected output suggests that not all possible combinations are needed, but rather a specific subset.

3. **Re-evaluate the Problem Statement:**

   Upon closer inspection, the expected output seems to suggest a specific pairing order. The expected result is not all possible combinations but rather a specific sequence of sums.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

- We need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the next tuple in the list, wrapping around to the start if necessary.
- Specifically, for a list of tuples `[(a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h)]`, the expected pairs are:
  - `(a + d)`
  - `(c + f)`
  - `(e + h)`
  - `(g + b)`
  - `(a + f)`
  - `(c + h)`

### Corrected Pseudocode

```
function find_combinations(tuple_list):
    initialize an empty list called result
    get the length of the tuple_list as n
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+1) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+2) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list
    return the result list
```

### Corrected Python Solution

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Get the length of the tuple list
    n = len(tuple_list)
    
    # First pass: pair each first element with the second element of the next tuple
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
        # and the second element of the next tuple (with wrap-around)
        sum_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[(i+1) % n][1],)
        
        # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
        result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Second pass: pair each first element with the second element of the tuple two places ahead
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
        # and the second element of the tuple two places ahead (with wrap-around)
        sum_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[(i+2) % n][1],)
        
        # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
        result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of sum tuples
    return result
```

This solution should now correctly produce the expected output by following the specific pairing pattern observed in the expected result.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Identify the Issue:**

   The current implementation is still incorrect because it does not produce the expected output. The expected output suggests a specific pairing pattern that was not correctly identified in the previous solution.

2. **Understanding the Expected Output:**

   The expected output is a list of tuples where each tuple is formed by summing the first element of one tuple with the second element of another tuple. The specific pairs are not all possible combinations but rather a specific subset.

3. **Re-evaluate the Problem Statement:**

   The expected output suggests that the pairs are formed by:
   - Pairing the first element of the first tuple with the second element of the second tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the second tuple with the second element of the third tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the third tuple with the second element of the fourth tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the fourth tuple with the second element of the first tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the first tuple with the second element of the third tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the second tuple with the second element of the fourth tuple.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

- We need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the next tuple in the list, wrapping around to the start if necessary.
- Additionally, we need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the tuple two places ahead, wrapping around if necessary.

### Corrected Pseudocode

        append the sum as a tuple to the result list

        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+2) % n]

    return the result list
```

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the sum of the first element of one tuple and the second element of another tuple from the input list. The order of the tuples in the output list should be based on the order of the sums.

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over each tuple in the input list.
   - For each tuple, we will pair its first element with the second element of every other tuple in the list.
   - We will calculate the sum of these paired elements and store them as tuples in a new list.
   - Finally, we will return the list of these sum tuples.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function find_combinations(tuple_list):
       initialize an empty list called result
       for each tuple1 in tuple_list:
           for each tuple2 in tuple_list:
               if tuple1 is not the same as tuple2:
                   calculate the sum of the first element of tuple1 and the second element of tuple2
                   append the sum as a tuple to the result list
       return the result list
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        # Get the first element of the current tuple
        first_element = tuple_list[i][0]
        
        # Iterate over each tuple again to pair with the current tuple
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not pairing the tuple with itself
            if i != j:
                # Get the second element of the other tuple
                second_element = tuple_list[j][1]
                
                # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
                # and the second element of the other tuple
                sum_tuple = (first_element + second_element,)
                
                # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
                result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of sum tuples
    return result

1. **Identify the Issue:**

   The current implementation is still incorrect because it does not produce the expected output. The expected output suggests a specific pairing pattern that was not correctly identified in the previous solution.

2. **Understanding the Expected Output:**

   The expected output is a list of tuples where each tuple is formed by summing the first element of one tuple with the second element of another tuple. The specific pairs are not all possible combinations but rather a specific subset.

3. **Re-evaluate the Problem Statement:**

   The expected output suggests that the pairs are formed by:
   - Pairing the first element of the first tuple with the second element of the second tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the second tuple with the second element of the third tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the third tuple with the second element of the fourth tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the fourth tuple with the second element of the first tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the first tuple with the second element of the third tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the second tuple with the second element of the fourth tuple.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

- We need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the next tuple in the list, wrapping around to the start if necessary.
- Additionally, we need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the tuple two places ahead, wrapping around if necessary.

### Corrected Pseudocode

```
function find_combinations(tuple_list):
    initialize an empty list called result
    get the length of the tuple_list as n
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+1) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+2) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list
    return the result list
```

### Corrected Python Solution

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Get the length of the tuple list
    n = len(tuple_list)
    
    # First pass: pair each first element with the second element of the next tuple
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
        # and the second element of the next tuple (with wrap-around)
        sum_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[(i+1) % n][1], tuple_list[(i+1) % n][0] + tuple_list[i][1])
        
        # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
        result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of sum tuples

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the sum of the first element of one tuple and the second element of another tuple from the input list. The order of the tuples in the output list should be based on the order of the sums.

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over each tuple in the input list.
   - For each tuple, we will pair its first element with the second element of every other tuple in the list.
   - We will calculate the sum of these paired elements and store them as tuples in a new list.
   - Finally, we will return the list of these sum tuples.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function find_combinations(tuple_list):
       initialize an empty list called result
       for each tuple1 in tuple_list:
           for each tuple2 in tuple_list:
               if tuple1 is not the same as tuple2:
                   calculate the sum of the first element of tuple1 and the second element of tuple2
                   append the sum as a tuple to the result list
       return the result list
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        # Get the first element of the current tuple
        first_element = tuple_list[i][0]
        
        # Iterate over each tuple again to pair with the current tuple
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not pairing the tuple with itself
            if i != j:
                # Get the second element of the other tuple
                second_element = tuple_list[j][1]
                
                # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
                # and the second element of the other tuple
                sum_tuple = (first_element + second_element,)
                
                # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
                result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of sum tuples
    return result

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Identify the Issue:**

   The current implementation is incorrect because it calculates the sum of the first element of one tuple with the second element of every other tuple, including itself. This results in incorrect sums and more combinations than expected.

2. **Understanding the Expected Output:**

   The expected output is a list of tuples where each tuple is formed by summing the first element of one tuple with the second element of another tuple, but only for specific pairs. The expected output suggests that not all possible combinations are needed, but rather a specific subset.

3. **Re-evaluate the Problem Statement:**

   Upon closer inspection, the expected output seems to suggest a specific pairing order. The expected result is not all possible combinations but rather a specific sequence of sums.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

- We need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the next tuple in the list, wrapping around to the start if necessary.
- Specifically, for a list of tuples `[(a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h)]`, the expected pairs are:
  - `(a + d)`
  - `(c + f)`
  - `(e + h)`
  - `(g + b)`
  - `(a + f)`
  - `(c + h)`

        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+2) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] ### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Identify the Issue:**

   The current implementation is still incorrect because it does not produce the expected output. The expected output suggests a specific pairing pattern that was not correctly identified in the previous solution.

2. **Understanding the Expected Output:**

   The expected output is a list of tuples where each tuple is formed by summing the first element of one tuple with the second element of another tuple. The specific pairs are not all possible combinations but rather a specific subset.

3. **Re-evaluate the Problem Statement:**

   The expected output suggests that the pairs are formed by:
   - Pairing the first element of the first tuple with the second element of the second tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the second tuple with the second element of the third tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the third tuple with the second element of the fourth tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the fourth tuple with the second element of the first tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the first tuple with the second element of the third tuple.
   - Pairing the first element of the second tuple with the second element of the fourth tuple.

### Corrected Conceptual Solution

- We need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the next tuple in the list.
- Additionally, we need to pair the first element of each tuple with the second element of the tuple two places ahead.

### Corrected Pseudocode

```
function find_combinations(tuple_list):
    initialize an empty list called result
    get the length of the tuple_list as n
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+1) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        calculate the sum of the first element of tuple_list[i] and the second element of tuple_list[(i+2) % n]
        append the sum as a tuple to the result list
    return the result list
```

### Corrected Python Solution

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Get the length of the tuple list
    n = len(tuple_list)
    
    # First pass: pair each first element with the second element of the next tuple
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
        # and the second element of the next tuple
        sum_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[(i+1) % n][1],)
        
        # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
        result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Second pass: pair each first element with the second element of the tuple two places ahead
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple
        # and the second element of the tuple two places ahead
        sum_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[(i+2) % n][1],)
        
        # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list
        result.append(sum_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of sum tuples
    return result
```

This solution should now correctly produce the expected output by following the specific pairing pattern observed in the expected result.
