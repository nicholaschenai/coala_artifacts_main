    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the sum of the first element of one tuple and the second element of another tuple from the input list. The order of the tuples in the output list should be based on the order of the sums.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each tuple in the input list.\n   - For each tuple, we will pair its first element with the second element of every other tuple in the list.\n   - We will calculate the sum of these paired elements and store them as tuples in a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of these sum tuples.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_combinations(tuple_list):\n       initialize an empty list called result\n       for each tuple1 in tuple_list:\n           for each tuple2 in tuple_list:\n               if tuple1 is not the same as tuple2:\n                   calculate the sum of the first element of tuple1 and the second element of tuple2\n                   append the sum as a tuple to the result list\n       return the result list\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_combinations(tuple_list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):\n        # Get the first element of the current tuple\n        first_element = tuple_list[i][0]\n        \n        # Iterate over each tuple again to pair with the current tuple\n        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):\n            # Ensure we are not pairing the tuple with itself\n            if i != j:\n                # Get the second element of the other tuple\n                second_element = tuple_list[j][1]\n                \n                # Calculate the sum of the first element of the current tuple\n                # and the second element of the other tuple\n                sum_tuple = (first_element + second_element,)\n                \n                # Append the sum as a tuple to the result list\n                result.append(sum_tuple)\n    \n    # Return the list of sum tuples\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement.",
