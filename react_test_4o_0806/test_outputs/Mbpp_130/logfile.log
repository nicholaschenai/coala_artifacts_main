You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/130 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the number that appears most frequently in the list. If there is a tie (multiple numbers with the same maximum frequency), we can return any one of them.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
- Create a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number in the list.
- Iterate through the list and update the frequency count for each number in the dictionary.
- After processing the entire list, find the number with the highest frequency in the dictionary.
- Return the number with the maximum frequency.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function max_occurrences(lst):
    create an empty dictionary called frequency_count
    for each number in lst:
        if number is in frequency_count:
            increment its count by 1
        else:
            add number to frequency_count with a count of 1
    initialize max_count to 0
    initialize max_number to None
    for each number, count in frequency_count:
        if count is greater than max_count:
            update max_count to count
            update max_number to number
    return max_number
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def max_occurrences(lst):
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each number
    frequency_count = {}
    
    # Iterate through the list to count the occurrences of each number
    for number in lst:
        if number in frequency_count:
            frequency_count[number] += 1
        else:
            frequency_count[number] = 1
    
    # Initialize variables to track the number with the maximum frequency
    max_count = 0
    max_number = None
    
    # Iterate through the frequency dictionary to find the number with the highest frequency
    for number, count in frequency_count.items():
        if count > max_count:
            max_count = count
            max_number = number
    
    # Return the number with the maximum frequency
    return max_number
```

This code will correctly find and return the number that appears most frequently in the given list.
