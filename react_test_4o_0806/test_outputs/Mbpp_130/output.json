    "raw_msg": "Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.\n\n### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the number that appears most frequently in the list. If there is a tie (multiple numbers with the same maximum frequency), we can return any one of them.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n- Create a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number in the list.\n- Iterate through the list and update the frequency count for each number in the dictionary.\n- After processing the entire list, find the number with the highest frequency in the dictionary.\n- Return the number with the maximum frequency.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction max_occurrences(lst):\n    create an empty dictionary called frequency_count\n    for each number in lst:\n        if number is in frequency_count:\n            increment its count by 1\n        else:\n            add number to frequency_count with a count of 1\n    initialize max_count to 0\n    initialize max_number to None\n    for each number, count in frequency_count:\n        if count is greater than max_count:\n            update max_count to count\n            update max_number to number\n    return max_number\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef max_occurrences(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each number\n    frequency_count = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through the list to count the occurrences of each number\n    for number in lst:\n        if number in frequency_count:\n            frequency_count[number] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_count[number] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the number with the maximum frequency\n    max_count = 0\n    max_number = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the frequency dictionary to find the number with the highest frequency\n    for number, count in frequency_count.items():\n        if count > max_count:\n            max_count = count\n            max_number = number\n    \n    # Return the number with the maximum frequency\n    return max_number\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find and return the number that appears most frequently in the given list.",
