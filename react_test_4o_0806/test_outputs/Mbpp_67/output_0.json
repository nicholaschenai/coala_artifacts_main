    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem asks us to find the number of ways to partition a set of size `n` using Bell numbers. The Bell number for a given `n` represents the number of different ways to partition a set of `n` elements into non-empty subsets.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Bell Numbers**: Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that represent the number of ways to partition a set. For example, the Bell number for `n=0` is `1` (the empty set), for `n=1` is `1` (one element can only be in one subset), for `n=2` is `2` (either both elements are in one subset or each element is in its own subset), and so on.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula**: Bell numbers can be calculated using a recursive formula:\n   - \\( B(n+1) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} B(k) \\)\n   - This means the Bell number for `n+1` is the sum of combinations of `n` taken `k` at a time multiplied by the Bell number of `k`.\n\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We can calculate Bell numbers iteratively using a table (or list) to store previously calculated Bell numbers to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a list `bell` with the first Bell number `B(0) = 1`.\n2. For each number from `1` to `n`:\n   - Initialize a temporary list `current` to store the Bell numbers for the current `n`.\n   - Set the first element of `current` to the last element of `bell`.\n   - For each `j` from `1` to `i` (where `i` is the current number):\n     - Calculate the current Bell number using the formula: `current[j] = current[j-1] + bell[j-1]`.\n   - Append the last element of `current` to `bell`.\n3. Return the last element of `bell` which is `B(n)`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef bell_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the list with the first Bell number\n    bell = [1]\n    \n    # Calculate Bell numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Initialize the current row with the first element\n        current = [bell[-1]]\n        \n        # Fill the current row using the previous row\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            current.append(current[j - 1] + bell[j - 1])\n        \n        # Append the last element of the current row to the bell list\n        bell.append(current[-1])\n    \n    # Return the nth Bell number\n    return bell[n]\n```\n\nThis code calculates the Bell number for a given `n` using an iterative approach, storing intermediate results to efficiently compute the desired Bell number.",
