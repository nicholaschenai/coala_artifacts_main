You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/145 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array of integers. The array is provided as a tuple.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify the smallest and largest elements in the array.
   - The maximum difference will be the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

   This approach works because the maximum difference between any two numbers in a set is always the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function max_Abs_Diff(arr):
       - Find the minimum value in the array and store it in min_value
       - Find the maximum value in the array and store it in max_value
       - Calculate the difference: max_value - min_value
       - Return the difference
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def max_Abs_Diff(arr: tuple) -> int:
    # Find the minimum value in the array
    min_value = min(arr)
    # Find the maximum value in the array
    max_value = max(arr)
    # Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values
    difference = max_value - min_value
    # Return the calculated difference
    return difference
```

This function will correctly compute the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by leveraging the built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the smallest and largest elements, respectively.

    # Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values
