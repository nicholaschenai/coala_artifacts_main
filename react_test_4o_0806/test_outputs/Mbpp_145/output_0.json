    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array of integers. The array is provided as a tuple.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, we can follow these steps:\n   - Identify the smallest and largest elements in the array.\n   - The maximum difference will be the difference between the largest and smallest elements.\n\n   This approach works because the maximum difference between any two numbers in a set is always the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function max_Abs_Diff(arr):\n       - Find the minimum value in the array and store it in min_value\n       - Find the maximum value in the array and store it in max_value\n       - Calculate the difference: max_value - min_value\n       - Return the difference\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr: tuple) -> int:\n    # Find the minimum value in the array\n    min_value = min(arr)\n    # Find the maximum value in the array\n    max_value = max(arr)\n    # Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values\n    difference = max_value - min_value\n    # Return the calculated difference\n    return difference\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by leveraging the built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the smallest and largest elements, respectively.",
