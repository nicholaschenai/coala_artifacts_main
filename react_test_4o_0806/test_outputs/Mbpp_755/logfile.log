You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the second smallest number in that list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Unique Values**: First, we need to ensure that we are considering only unique numbers in the list. This is important because if the smallest number appears multiple times, we still need to find the second smallest distinct number.
   
2. **Sort the Unique Values**: Once we have a list of unique numbers, we can sort this list in ascending order.

3. **Select the Second Smallest**: After sorting, the second element in this sorted list will be the second smallest number.

## Pseudocode

1. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
2. Convert the set back to a list.
3. Sort the list of unique numbers.
4. Return the second element from the sorted list.

## Python Code

```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    # Step 1: Remove duplicates by converting the list to a set
    unique_numbers = set(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Convert the set back to a list
    unique_numbers = list(unique_numbers)
    
    # Step 3: Sort the list of unique numbers
    unique_numbers.sort()
    
    # Step 4: Return the second element from the sorted list
    return unique_numbers[1]
```

This function will correctly find the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates, sorting the unique numbers, and then selecting the second element from the sorted list.

    unique_numbers = list(unique_numbers)
    
    # Step 3: Sort the list of unique numbers
    unique_numbers.sort()
    
    # Step 4: Return the second element from the sorted list
