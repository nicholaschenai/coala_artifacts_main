INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/125 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s in any substring of a given binary string. The goal is to identify the substring where this difference is the largest.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's. We need to find a substring where the count of '0's minus the count of '1's is maximized.

2. **Approach**:
   - We can treat each '0' as +1 and each '1' as -1. This way, the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, which is a classic problem solvable by Kadane's algorithm.
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the current sum and another to keep track of the maximum sum found so far.
   - Traverse the string, updating the current sum by adding +1 for '0' and -1 for '1'.
   - If the current sum becomes negative, reset it to zero (since a negative sum would not contribute positively to any future subarray).
   - Update the maximum sum whenever the current sum exceeds it.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is empty, the maximum difference is 0.
   - If the string contains only '1's, the maximum difference is 0.
   - If the string contains only '0's, the maximum difference is the length of the string.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_length(s):
    max_diff = 0
    current_diff = 0
    
    for each character in s:
        if character is '0':
            current_diff += 1
        else if character is '1':
            current_diff -= 1
        
        if current_diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = current_diff
        
        if current_diff < 0:
            current_diff = 0
    
    return max_diff
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_length(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize the maximum difference and current difference
    max_diff = 0
    current_diff = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Increment current_diff for '0', decrement for '1'
        if char == '0':
            current_diff += 1
        else:  # char == '1'
            current_diff -= 1
        
        # Update max_diff if current_diff is greater
        if current_diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = current_diff
        
        # Reset current_diff if it becomes negative
        if current_diff < 0:
            current_diff = 0
    
    # Return the maximum difference found
    return max_diff
```

This solution efficiently finds the maximum difference using a single pass through the string, making it O(n) in time complexity, where n is the length of the string.
