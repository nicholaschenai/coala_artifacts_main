    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s in any substring of a given binary string. The goal is to identify the substring where this difference is the largest.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's. We need to find a substring where the count of '0's minus the count of '1's is maximized.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n   - We can treat each '0' as +1 and each '1' as -1. This way, the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, which is a classic problem solvable by Kadane's algorithm.\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the current sum and another to keep track of the maximum sum found so far.\n   - Traverse the string, updating the current sum by adding +1 for '0' and -1 for '1'.\n   - If the current sum becomes negative, reset it to zero (since a negative sum would not contribute positively to any future subarray).\n   - Update the maximum sum whenever the current sum exceeds it.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If the string is empty, the maximum difference is 0.\n   - If the string contains only '1's, the maximum difference is 0.\n   - If the string contains only '0's, the maximum difference is the length of the string.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_length(s):\n    max_diff = 0\n    current_diff = 0\n    \n    for each character in s:\n        if character is '0':\n            current_diff += 1\n        else if character is '1':\n            current_diff -= 1\n        \n        if current_diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = current_diff\n        \n        if current_diff < 0:\n            current_diff = 0\n    \n    return max_diff\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_length(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum difference and current difference\n    max_diff = 0\n    current_diff = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # Increment current_diff for '0', decrement for '1'\n        if char == '0':\n            current_diff += 1\n        else:  # char == '1'\n            current_diff -= 1\n        \n        # Update max_diff if current_diff is greater\n        if current_diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = current_diff\n        \n        # Reset current_diff if it becomes negative\n        if current_diff < 0:\n            current_diff = 0\n    \n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_diff\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the maximum difference using a single pass through the string, making it O(n) in time complexity, where n is the length of the string.",
