You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/565 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a list where each element is a single character from the string.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The task is straightforward because Python strings are iterable, meaning we can easily convert them into a list of characters. We can use the `list()` function, which takes an iterable (like a string) and returns a list of its elements.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `split` that takes a single parameter `s`.
   - Use the `list()` function to convert the string `s` into a list of characters.
   - Return the resulting list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def split(s: str) -> list:
    # Convert the string 's' into a list of characters using the list() function
    return list(s)
```

This solution uses Python's built-in `list()` function to convert the input string into a list of its characters, which is both efficient and concise.
