1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices in the expansion of `(x + y)^n`. The binomial coefficient at index `k` in this expansion is given by `C(n, k)`, which is the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Calculate the binomial coefficients for even indices from 0 to `n`.
   - Sum these coefficients.
   - Return the sum.

   The binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n-k)!}
   \]
   where `!` denotes factorial.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function factorial that calculates the factorial of a number.
   
   Define the main function even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):
       Initialize sum_even_coeff to 0
       For each even index k from 0 to n (inclusive):
           Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k) using the factorial function
           Add the binomial coefficient to sum_even_coeff
       Return sum_even_coeff
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
# Helper function to calculate factorial of a number
def factorial(num: int) -> int:
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, num + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Main function to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients
def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    sum_even_coeff = 0
    # Iterate over even indices from 0 to n
    for k in range(0, n + 1, 2):
        # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)
        binomial_coeff = factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))
        # Add the binomial coefficient to the sum
        sum_even_coeff += binomial_coeff
    return sum_even_coeff
```

This code defines a helper function `factorial` to compute the factorial of a number, and the main function `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum` to compute the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given `n`.

 ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices in the expansion of `(x + y)^n`. The binomial coefficient at index `k` in this expansion is given by `C(n, k)`, which is the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Calculate the binomial coefficients for even indices from 0 to `n`.
   - Sum these coefficients.
   - Return the sum.

   The binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n-k)!}
   \]
   where `!` denotes factorial.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function factorial that calculates the factorial of a number.
   
   Define the main function even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):
       Initialize sum_even_coeff to 0
       For each even index k from 0 to n (inclusive):
           Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k) using the factorial function
           Add the binomial coefficient to sum_even_coeff
       Return sum_even_coeff
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
# Helper function to calculate factorial of a number
def factorial(num: int) -> int:
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, num + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Main function to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients
def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    sum_even_coeff = 0
    # Iterate over even indices from 0 to n
    for k in range(0, n + 1, 2):
        # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)
        binomial_coeff = factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))
        # Add the binomial coefficient to the sum
        sum_even_coeff += binomial_coeff
    return sum_even_coeff
```

This code defines a helper function `factorial` to compute the factorial of a number, and the main function `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum` to compute the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given `n`.
