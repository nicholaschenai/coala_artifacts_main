The binomial coefficient at index `k` in this expansion is given by `C(n, k)`, which is the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Calculate the binomial coefficients for even indices from 0 to `n`.\n   - Sum these coefficients.\n   - Return the sum.\n\n   The binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k! \\cdot (n-k)!}\n   \\]\n   where `!` denotes factorial.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function factorial that calculates the factorial of a number.\n   \n   Define the main function even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):\n       Initialize sum_even_coeff to 0\n       For each even index k from 0 to n (inclusive):\n           Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k) using the factorial function\n           Add the binomial coefficient to sum_even_coeff\n       Return sum_even_coeff\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\n# Helper function to calculate factorial of a number\ndef factorial(num: int) -> int:\n    if num == 0 or num == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(2, num + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\n# Main function to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients\ndef even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    sum_even_coeff = 0\n    # Iterate over even indices from 0 to n\n    for k in range(0, n + 1, 2):\n        # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)\n        binomial_coeff = factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))\n        # Add the binomial coefficient to the sum\n        sum_even_coeff += binomial_coeff\n    return sum_even_coeff\n```\n\nThis code defines a helper function `factorial` to compute the factorial of a number, and the main function `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum` to compute the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given `n`."
