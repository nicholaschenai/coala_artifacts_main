    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list and an integer `n` as inputs. The function should split the list at the `n`-th index and then move the first part of the list to the end. The result should be a new list where the elements from index `n` to the end of the original list come first, followed by the elements from the start of the list up to index `n-1`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, identify the position `n` in the list where the split should occur.\n   - Divide the list into two parts: the first part from the start of the list to the `n-1` index, and the second part from the `n` index to the end of the list.\n   - Concatenate the second part of the list with the first part.\n   - Return the concatenated list as the result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function split_Arr(arr, n):\n       first_part = arr[0:n]\n       second_part = arr[n:]\n       result = second_part + first_part\n       return result\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef split_Arr(arr, n):\n    # Split the list into two parts: from start to n-1 and from n to end\n    first_part = arr[0:n]\n    second_part = arr[n:]\n    \n    # Concatenate the second part with the first part\n    result = second_part + first_part\n    \n    # Return the rearranged list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take a list and an integer `n`, split the list at the `n`-th index, and rearrange it by moving the first part to the end, returning the modified list.",
