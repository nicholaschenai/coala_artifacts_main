You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/586 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list and an integer `n` as inputs. The function should split the list at the `n`-th index and then move the first part of the list to the end. The result should be a new list where the elements from index `n` to the end of the original list come first, followed by the elements from the start of the list up to index `n-1`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, identify the position `n` in the list where the split should occur.
   - Divide the list into two parts: the first part from the start of the list to the `n-1` index, and the second part from the `n` index to the end of the list.
   - Concatenate the second part of the list with the first part.
   - Return the concatenated list as the result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function split_Arr(arr, n):
       first_part = arr[0:n]
       second_part = arr[n:]
       result = second_part + first_part
       return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def split_Arr(arr, n):
    # Split the list into two parts: from start to n-1 and from n to end
    first_part = arr[0:n]
    second_part = arr[n:]
    
    # Concatenate the second part with the first part
    result = second_part + first_part
    
    # Return the rearranged list
    return result
```

This function will take a list and an integer `n`, split the list at the `n`-th index, and rearrange it by moving the first part to the end, returning the modified list.
