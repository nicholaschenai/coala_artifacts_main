INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/555 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the difference between two sums for the first `n` natural numbers:
1. The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.
2. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Sum of Cubes**: For the first `n` natural numbers, calculate the sum of their cubes. This means for numbers 1 through `n`, compute \(1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + n^3\).

2. **Sum of Natural Numbers**: Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is \(1 + 2 + \ldots + n\).

3. **Difference**: Subtract the sum of the natural numbers from the sum of their cubes.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize `sum_of_cubes` to 0.
2. Initialize `sum_of_numbers` to 0.
3. Loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive):
   - Add `i^3` to `sum_of_cubes`.
   - Add `i` to `sum_of_numbers`.
4. Calculate the difference as `sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers`.
5. Return the difference.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def difference(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize sums
    sum_of_cubes = 0
    sum_of_numbers = 0
    
    # Calculate the sums
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3
        sum_of_numbers += i
    
    # Calculate the difference
    diff = sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers
    
    # Return the result
    return diff
```

This function will correctly compute the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
