        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the difference between two sums for the first `n` natural numbers:\n1. The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.\n2. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Sum of Cubes**: For the first `n` natural numbers, calculate the sum of their cubes. This means for numbers 1 through `n`, compute \\(1^3 + 2^3 + \\ldots + n^3\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Natural Numbers**: Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is \\(1 + 2 + \\ldots + n\\).\n\n3. **Difference**: Subtract the sum of the natural numbers from the sum of their cubes.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize `sum_of_cubes` to 0.\n2. Initialize `sum_of_numbers` to 0.\n3. Loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive):\n   - Add `i^3` to `sum_of_cubes`.\n   - Add `i` to `sum_of_numbers`.\n4. Calculate the difference as `sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers`.\n5. Return the difference.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef difference(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize sums\n    sum_of_cubes = 0\n    sum_of_numbers = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the sums\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3\n        sum_of_numbers += i\n    \n    # Calculate the difference\n    diff = sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers\n    \n    # Return the result\n    return diff\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers."
