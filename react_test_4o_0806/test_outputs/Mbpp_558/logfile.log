You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/558 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding digits of two integers. For example, if the two integers are 123 and 456, we would calculate the absolute difference between 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6, and then sum these differences.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Convert both integers to strings so that we can easily access each digit.
2. Determine the length of the longer number to ensure we compare all digits.
3. Pad the shorter number with leading zeros to match the length of the longer number.
4. Iterate over the digits of both numbers simultaneously.
5. For each pair of digits, calculate the absolute difference and add it to a running total.
6. Return the total sum of these differences.

### Pseudocode

```
function digit_distance_nums(a, b):
    convert a and b to strings
    determine the maximum length of the two strings
    pad the shorter string with leading zeros
    initialize a variable total_difference to 0
    for each pair of digits in the strings:
        calculate the absolute difference
        add the difference to total_difference
    return total_difference
```

### Python Code

```python
def digit_distance_nums(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Convert both numbers to strings
    str_a = str(a)
    str_b = str(b)
    
    # Determine the maximum length of the two numbers
    max_length = max(len(str_a), len(str_b))
    
    # Pad the shorter number with leading zeros
    str_a = str_a.zfill(max_length)
    str_b = str_b.zfill(max_length)
    
    # Initialize the total difference
    total_difference = 0
    
    # Iterate over the digits of both numbers
    for digit_a, digit_b in zip(str_a, str_b):
        # Calculate the absolute difference and add to the total
        total_difference += abs(int(digit_a) - int(digit_b))
    
    # Return the total difference
