        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding digits of two integers. For example, if the two integers are 123 and 456, we would calculate the absolute difference between 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6, and then sum these differences.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Convert both integers to strings so that we can easily access each digit.\n2. Determine the length of the longer number to ensure we compare all digits.\n3. Pad the shorter number with leading zeros to match the length of the longer number.\n4. Iterate over the digits of both numbers simultaneously.\n5. For each pair of digits, calculate the absolute difference and add it to a running total.\n6. Return the total sum of these differences.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction digit_distance_nums(a, b):\n    convert a and b to strings\n    determine the maximum length of the two strings\n    pad the shorter string with leading zeros\n    initialize a variable total_difference to 0\n    for each pair of digits in the strings:\n        calculate the absolute difference\n        add the difference to total_difference\n    return total_difference\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef digit_distance_nums(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Convert both numbers to strings\n    str_a = str(a)\n    str_b = str(b)\n    \n    # Determine the maximum length of the two numbers\n    max_length = max(len(str_a), len(str_b))\n    \n    # Pad the shorter number with leading zeros\n    str_a = str_a.zfill(max_length)\n    str_b = str_b.zfill(max_length)\n    \n    # Initialize the total difference\n    total_difference = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the digits of both numbers\n    for digit_a, digit_b in zip(str_a, str_b):\n        # Calculate the absolute difference and add to the total\n        total_difference += abs(int(digit_a) - int(digit_b))\n    \n    # Return the total difference\n    return total_difference\n```"
