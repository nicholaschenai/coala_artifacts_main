You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/11 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a string and a character as inputs. The function should remove the first and last occurrence of the specified character from the string and return the modified string.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the First Occurrence**: Find the index of the first occurrence of the specified character in the string.
2. **Identify the Last Occurrence**: Find the index of the last occurrence of the specified character in the string.
3. **Remove the Characters**: If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), remove it. Otherwise, remove both the first and last occurrences.
4. **Return the Modified String**: Construct the new string without the first and last occurrences of the character and return it.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `remove_Occ` that takes two parameters: `s` (the string) and `char` (the character to remove).
2. Find the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` and store it in `first_index`.
3. Find the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` and store it in `last_index`.
4. If `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, remove the character at `first_index` from `s`.
5. Otherwise, remove the characters at both `first_index` and `last_index` from `s`.
6. Return the modified string.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def remove_Occ(s: str, char: str) -> str:
    # Find the first occurrence of the character
    first_index = s.find(char)
    # Find the last occurrence of the character
    last_index = s.rfind(char)
    
    # If the character is found
    if first_index != -1:
        # If the first and last occurrence are the same, remove it once
        if first_index == last_index:
            s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index+1:]
        else:
            # Remove the first occurrence
            s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index+1:]
            # Adjust last_index because the string is now shorter by one character
            last_index -= 1
            # Remove the last occurrence
            s = s[:last_index] + s[last_index+1:]
    
    return s
```

This solution efficiently removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the string and returns the modified string.

            # Remove the last occurrence
            s = s[:last_index] + s[last_index+1:]
    
    return s
```
