        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a string and a character as inputs. The function should remove the first and last occurrence of the specified character from the string and return the modified string.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the First Occurrence**: Find the index of the first occurrence of the specified character in the string.\n2. **Identify the Last Occurrence**: Find the index of the last occurrence of the specified character in the string.\n3. **Remove the Characters**: If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), remove it. Otherwise, remove both the first and last occurrences.\n4. **Return the Modified String**: Construct the new string without the first and last occurrences of the character and return it.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `remove_Occ` that takes two parameters: `s` (the string) and `char` (the character to remove).\n2. Find the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` and store it in `first_index`.\n3. Find the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` and store it in `last_index`.\n4. If `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, remove the character at `first_index` from `s`.\n5. Otherwise, remove the characters at both `first_index` and `last_index` from `s`.\n6. Return the modified string.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(s: str, char: str) -> str:\n    # Find the first occurrence of the character\n    first_index = s.find(char)\n    # Find the last occurrence of the character\n    last_index = s.rfind(char)\n    \n    # If the character is found\n    if first_index != -1:\n        # If the first and last occurrence are the same, remove it once\n        if first_index == last_index:\n            s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index+1:]\n        else:\n            # Remove the first occurrence\n            s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index+1:]\n            # Adjust last_index because the string is now shorter by one character\n            last_index -= 1\n            # Remove the last occurrence\n            s = s[:last_index] + s[last_index+1:]\n    \n    return s\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the string and returns the modified string."
