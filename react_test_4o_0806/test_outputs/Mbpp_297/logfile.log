You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/297 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list which may contain nested lists and returns a single flattened list with all the elements in a single level.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. We will iterate through each element in the list. If an element is a list itself, we will recursively flatten it and add its elements to the result. If an element is not a list, we will directly add it to the result. This way, we can handle any level of nesting.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function flatten_list that takes a list as input.
   Initialize an empty list called flat_list to store the result.
   For each element in the input list:
       If the element is a list:
           Recursively call flatten_list on this element and extend flat_list with the result.
       Else:
           Append the element to flat_list.
   Return flat_list.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def flatten_list(nested_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the flattened elements
    flat_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each element in the input list
    for element in nested_list:
        # If the element is a list, recursively flatten it
        if isinstance(element, list):
            # Extend the flat_list with the flattened result of the element
            flat_list.extend(flatten_list(element))
        else:
            # If the element is not a list, append it directly to flat_list
            flat_list.append(element)
    
    # Return the fully flattened list
    return flat_list
```

This solution uses recursion to handle any level of nested lists, ensuring that all elements are added to a single flat list.
