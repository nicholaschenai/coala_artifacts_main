The function should return a new list containing two lists: the first list should contain all the first elements from each sublist, and the second list should contain all the second elements from each sublist.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize two empty lists: one for storing the first elements of each sublist and another for storing the second elements.\n2. Iterate over each sublist in the input list.\n3. For each sublist, append the first element to the first list and the second element to the second list.\n4. After processing all sublists, return a list containing the two lists.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction merge(list_of_lists):\n    initialize first_elements as an empty list\n    initialize second_elements as an empty list\n    \n    for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n        append the first element of sublist to first_elements\n        append the second element of sublist to second_elements\n    \n    return [first_elements, second_elements]\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef merge(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize two empty lists to store the first and second elements\n    first_elements = []\n    second_elements = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Append the first element of the sublist to first_elements\n        first_elements.append(sublist[0])\n        # Append the second element of the sublist to second_elements\n        second_elements.append(sublist[1])\n    \n    # Return a list containing the two lists\n    return [first_elements, second_elements]\n```"
