Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/612 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. The function should return a new list containing two lists: the first list should contain all the first elements from each sublist, and the second list should contain all the second elements from each sublist.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize two empty lists: one for storing the first elements of each sublist and another for storing the second elements.
2. Iterate over each sublist in the input list.
3. For each sublist, append the first element to the first list and the second element to the second list.
4. After processing all sublists, return a list containing the two lists.

## Pseudocode

```
function merge(list_of_lists):
    initialize first_elements as an empty list
    initialize second_elements as an empty list
    
    for each sublist in list_of_lists:
        append the first element of sublist to first_elements
        append the second element of sublist to second_elements
    
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def merge(list_of_lists):
    # Initialize two empty lists to store the first and second elements
    first_elements = []
    second_elements = []
    
    # Iterate over each sublist in the input list
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Append the first element of the sublist to first_elements
        first_elements.append(sublist[0])
        # Append the second element of the sublist to second_elements
        second_elements.append(sublist[1])
    
    # Return a list containing the two lists
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
```
