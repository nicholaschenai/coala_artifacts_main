You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/309 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - To solve this problem, we can compare the two numbers using a simple conditional statement. If the first number is greater than or equal to the second number, we return the first number. Otherwise, we return the second number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `maximum` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
   - Use an `if` statement to check if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
     - If true, return `a`.
     - Otherwise, return `b`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def maximum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Check if the first number is greater than or equal to the second number
    if a >= b:
        # If true, return the first number
        return a
    else:
        # Otherwise, return the second number
        return b
```

This function will correctly return the maximum of the two input numbers.
