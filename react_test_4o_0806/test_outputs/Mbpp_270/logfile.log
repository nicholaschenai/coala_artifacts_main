You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/270 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers that are located at even indices in the list. An even index is any index that is divisible by 2 (e.g., 0, 2, 4, ...).

### Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of even numbers at even indices.
2. Iterate over the list using the index to access each element.
3. For each element, check if the index is even.
4. If the index is even, check if the element at that index is also even.
5. If both the index and the element are even, add the element to the sum.
6. After iterating through the list, return the sum.

### Pseudocode

```
function sum_even_and_even_index(lst):
    initialize sum to 0
    for each index i from 0 to length of lst - 1:
        if i is even:
            if lst[i] is even:
                add lst[i] to sum
    return sum
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_even_and_even_index(lst):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over the list using index
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        # Check if the index is even
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # Check if the element at this index is even
            if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
                # Add the element to the sum
                total_sum += lst[i]
    
    # Return the total sum of even numbers at even indices
    return total_sum
```
