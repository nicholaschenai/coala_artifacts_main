        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers that are located at even indices in the list. An even index is any index that is divisible by 2 (e.g., 0, 2, 4, ...).\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of even numbers at even indices.\n2. Iterate over the list using the index to access each element.\n3. For each element, check if the index is even.\n4. If the index is even, check if the element at that index is also even.\n5. If both the index and the element are even, add the element to the sum.\n6. After iterating through the list, return the sum.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction sum_even_and_even_index(lst):\n    initialize sum to 0\n    for each index i from 0 to length of lst - 1:\n        if i is even:\n            if lst[i] is even:\n                add lst[i] to sum\n    return sum\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_and_even_index(lst):\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the list using index\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        # Check if the index is even\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # Check if the element at this index is even\n            if lst[i] % 2 == 0:\n                # Add the element to the sum\n                total_sum += lst[i]\n    \n    # Return the total sum of even numbers at even indices\n    return total_sum\n```"
