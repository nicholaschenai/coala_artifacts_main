You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/96 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the number of divisors of a given integer. A divisor is a number that divides another number completely without leaving a remainder.

### Conceptualizing the Solution

To find the number of divisors of a given integer `n`:
1. Initialize a counter to zero.
2. Iterate through all integers from 1 to `n`.
3. For each integer `i`, check if it divides `n` without leaving a remainder (i.e., `n % i == 0`).
4. If it does, increment the counter.
5. After checking all numbers, the counter will hold the total number of divisors of `n`.

### Pseudocode

```
function divisor(n):
    initialize count to 0
    for i from 1 to n (inclusive):
        if n % i == 0:
            increment count
    return count
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def divisor(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the count of divisors to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # Increment the count if i is a divisor
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of divisors
    return count
```
