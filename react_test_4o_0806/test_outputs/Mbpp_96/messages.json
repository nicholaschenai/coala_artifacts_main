A divisor is a number that divides another number completely without leaving a remainder.\n\n### Conceptualizing the Solution\n\nTo find the number of divisors of a given integer `n`:\n1. Initialize a counter to zero.\n2. Iterate through all integers from 1 to `n`.\n3. For each integer `i`, check if it divides `n` without leaving a remainder (i.e., `n % i == 0`).\n4. If it does, increment the counter.\n5. After checking all numbers, the counter will hold the total number of divisors of `n`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction divisor(n):\n    initialize count to 0\n    for i from 1 to n (inclusive):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            increment count\n    return count\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the count of divisors to 0\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # Increment the count if i is a divisor\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of divisors\n    return count\n```"
