You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/409 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should calculate the product of the two integers in each tuple and return the smallest product from all the tuples.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Initialize a variable to store the minimum product found so far. Start with a very large number (like infinity) to ensure any product will be smaller initially.
   - Iterate over each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, calculate the product of its two elements.
   - Compare this product with the current minimum product. If it's smaller, update the minimum product.
   - After checking all tuples, return the minimum product found.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function min_product_tuple(tuples_list):
       set min_product to infinity
       for each tuple in tuples_list:
           calculate product of the two numbers in the tuple
           if product is less than min_product:
               update min_product to be the product
       return min_product
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def min_product_tuple(tuples_list):
    # Initialize min_product to a very large number
    min_product = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for t in tuples_list:
        # Calculate the product of the two numbers in the tuple
        product = t[0] * t[1]
        
        # If the calculated product is less than the current min_product, update min_product
        if product < min_product:
            min_product = product
    
    # Return the smallest product found
    return min_product
```

This function will correctly find and return the minimum product from the pairs of tuples in the given list.
