The function should return a new tuple where each element is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate over the elements of the two input tuples simultaneously.\n2. For each pair of elements, we will perform a bitwise AND operation.\n3. We will collect the results of these operations into a new tuple.\n4. Finally, we will return the new tuple.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define the function `and_tuples` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.\n2. Initialize an empty list `result`.\n3. Loop over the elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2` using the `zip` function.\n   - For each pair of elements `(a, b)`, compute `a & b` and append the result to `result`.\n4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple.\n5. Return the resulting tuple.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the bitwise AND operations\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously\n    for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2):\n        # Perform bitwise AND operation and append the result to the list\n        result.append(a & b)\n    \n    # Convert the list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```"
