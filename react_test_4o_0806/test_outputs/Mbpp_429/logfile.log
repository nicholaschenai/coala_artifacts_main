You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/429 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function called `and_tuples` that takes two tuples of integers as input. The function should return a new tuple where each element is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate over the elements of the two input tuples simultaneously.
2. For each pair of elements, we will perform a bitwise AND operation.
3. We will collect the results of these operations into a new tuple.
4. Finally, we will return the new tuple.

## Pseudocode

1. Define the function `and_tuples` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
2. Initialize an empty list `result`.
3. Loop over the elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2` using the `zip` function.
   - For each pair of elements `(a, b)`, compute `a & b` and append the result to `result`.
4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple.
5. Return the resulting tuple.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the bitwise AND operations
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously
    for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        # Perform bitwise AND operation and append the result to the list
        result.append(a & b)
    
    # Convert the list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
```
