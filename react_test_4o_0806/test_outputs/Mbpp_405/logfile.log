INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/405 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/405 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a specific element is present in a given tuple. The function should return `True` if the element is found and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will define a function named `check_tuplex` that takes two parameters: a tuple and an element to search for.
   - We will use the `in` keyword in Python, which checks for the presence of an element in a collection, to determine if the element is in the tuple.
   - If the element is found, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function check_tuplex with parameters tuple_data and element
       Use the 'in' keyword to check if element is in tuple_data
       Return the result of the check
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_tuplex(tuple_data: tuple, element) -> bool:
    # Use the 'in' keyword to check if the element is in the tuple
    return element in tuple_data
```

This function will efficiently check for the presence of an element in a tuple using Python's built-in `in` keyword, which is both simple and effective for this task.
