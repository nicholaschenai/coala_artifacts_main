The function should ignore any non-numeric elements when determining the minimum value.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. Check if the element is a number (either an integer or a float).\n3. Keep track of the smallest number found so far.\n4. Return the smallest number after checking all elements.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a variable `min_value` to a very large number (or `None`).\n2. For each element `x` in the list:\n   - If `x` is an integer or a float:\n     - If `min_value` is `None` or `x` is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` to `x`.\n3. Return `min_value`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef min_val(lst):\n    # Initialize min_value to None\n    min_value = None\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for x in lst:\n        # Check if the element is a number (int or float)\n        if isinstance(x, (int, float)):\n            # If min_value is None or x is smaller, update min_value\n            if min_value is None or x < min_value:\n                min_value = x\n    \n    # Return the smallest number found\n    return min_value\n```"
