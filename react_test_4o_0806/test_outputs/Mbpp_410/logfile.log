INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/410 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/410 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list containing both strings and numbers and returns the smallest numerical value from that list. The function should ignore any non-numeric elements when determining the minimum value.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate through each element in the list.
2. Check if the element is a number (either an integer or a float).
3. Keep track of the smallest number found so far.
4. Return the smallest number after checking all elements.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a variable `min_value` to a very large number (or `None`).
2. For each element `x` in the list:
   - If `x` is an integer or a float:
     - If `min_value` is `None` or `x` is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` to `x`.
3. Return `min_value`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def min_val(lst):
    # Initialize min_value to None
    min_value = None
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for x in lst:
        # Check if the element is a number (int or float)
        if isinstance(x, (int, float)):
            # If min_value is None or x is smaller, update min_value
            if min_value is None or x < min_value:
                min_value = x
    
    # Return the smallest number found
    return min_value
