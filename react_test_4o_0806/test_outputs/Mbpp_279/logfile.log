You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/279 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to write a function that calculates the nth decagonal number. A decagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the decagon (a ten-sided polygon). The formula for the nth decagonal number is given by:

\[ D_n = 4n^2 - 3n \]

where \( n \) is the position in the sequence.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To find the nth decagonal number:
- Use the formula \( D_n = 4n^2 - 3n \).
- Substitute the given \( n \) into this formula to compute the decagonal number.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function is_num_decagonal(n):
    calculate decagonal_number using the formula 4 * n^2 - 3 * n
    return decagonal_number
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def is_num_decagonal(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth decagonal number using the formula
    # D_n = 4n^2 - 3n
    decagonal_number = 4 * n * n - 3 * n
    return decagonal_number
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth decagonal number by applying the formula \( D_n = 4n^2 - 3n \).
INFO - program_code:
 
def is_num_decagonal(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth decagonal number using the formula
    # D_n = 4n^2 - 3n
    decagonal_number = 4 * n * n - 3 * n
    return decagonal_number
