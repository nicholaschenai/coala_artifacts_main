The function will take a single string as input and return the length of that string using `len()`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named count_charac that takes a single parameter, input_string.\n   Use the len() function to calculate the number of characters in input_string.\n   Return the result from len().\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_charac(input_string: str) -> int:\n    # Use the len() function to get the number of characters in the input string\n    return len(input_string)\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count and return the number of characters in any given string."
