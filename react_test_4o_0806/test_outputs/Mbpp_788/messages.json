The function should return a new tuple that contains all the elements of the list followed by the string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The solution involves combining the elements of the list with the string into a single tuple. We can achieve this by converting the list into a tuple and then concatenating it with a tuple containing the single string.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `new_tuple` that takes two parameters: a list and a string.\n   - Convert the list into a tuple.\n   - Create a tuple from the string.\n   - Concatenate the two tuples.\n   - Return the resulting tuple.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef new_tuple(lst: list, s: str) -> tuple:\n    # Convert the list to a tuple\n    list_as_tuple = tuple(lst)\n    \n    # Create a tuple from the string\n    string_as_tuple = (s,)\n    \n    # Concatenate the two tuples\n    result_tuple = list_as_tuple + string_as_tuple\n    \n    # Return the resulting tuple\n    return result_tuple\n```"
