You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/788 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes a list of strings and a single string as inputs. The function should return a new tuple that contains all the elements of the list followed by the string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The solution involves combining the elements of the list with the string into a single tuple. We can achieve this by converting the list into a tuple and then concatenating it with a tuple containing the single string.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `new_tuple` that takes two parameters: a list and a string.
   - Convert the list into a tuple.
   - Create a tuple from the string.
   - Concatenate the two tuples.
   - Return the resulting tuple.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def new_tuple(lst: list, s: str) -> tuple:
    # Convert the list to a tuple
    list_as_tuple = tuple(lst)
    
    # Create a tuple from the string
    string_as_tuple = (s,)
    
    # Concatenate the two tuples
    result_tuple = list_as_tuple + string_as_tuple
    
    # Return the resulting tuple
    return result_tuple
```
