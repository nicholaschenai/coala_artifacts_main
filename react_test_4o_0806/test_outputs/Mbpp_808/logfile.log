You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/808 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that checks if a given integer `k` is present in a tuple of integers. The function should return `True` if `k` is found in the tuple, and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will define a function that takes two parameters: a tuple of integers and an integer `k`.
   - We will use the `in` keyword in Python to check if `k` is present in the tuple.
   - If `k` is found in the tuple, the function will return `True`.
   - If `k` is not found in the tuple, the function will return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function check_K with parameters (tuple_of_integers, k)
       If k is in tuple_of_integers
           Return True
       Else
           Return False
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_K(tuple_of_integers, k):
    # Check if k is present in the tuple_of_integers
    if k in tuple_of_integers:
        # If k is found, return True
        return True
    else:
        # If k is not found, return False
        return False
```

This function uses the `in` keyword to determine if `k` is an element of the tuple, which is a straightforward and efficient way to perform this check in Python.

        return True
    else:
        # If k is not found, return False
