The function should return `True` if `k` is found in the tuple, and `False` otherwise.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will define a function that takes two parameters: a tuple of integers and an integer `k`.\n   - We will use the `in` keyword in Python to check if `k` is present in the tuple.\n   - If `k` is found in the tuple, the function will return `True`.\n   - If `k` is not found in the tuple, the function will return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function check_K with parameters (tuple_of_integers, k)\n       If k is in tuple_of_integers\n           Return True\n       Else\n           Return False\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_K(tuple_of_integers, k):\n    # Check if k is present in the tuple_of_integers\n    if k in tuple_of_integers:\n        # If k is found, return True\n        return True\n    else:\n        # If k is not found, return False\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function uses the `in` keyword to determine if `k` is an element of the tuple, which is a straightforward and efficient way to perform this check in Python."
