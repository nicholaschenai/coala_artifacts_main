We can use this method to transform the input string to lowercase and return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `is_lower` that takes a single parameter `s` (the input string).\n   - Use the `lower()` method on the string `s` to convert it to lowercase.\n   - Return the resulting lowercase string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**\n\n```python\ndef is_lower(s: str) -> str:\n    # Convert the input string to lowercase using the lower() method\n    return s.lower()\n```\n\nThis function will take any string input and return it in lowercase, satisfying the problem requirements."
