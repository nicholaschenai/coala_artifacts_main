INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/477 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/477 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the same string converted to all lowercase letters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Python provides a built-in string method called `lower()` that converts all uppercase letters in a string to lowercase. We can use this method to transform the input string to lowercase and return the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `is_lower` that takes a single parameter `s` (the input string).
   - Use the `lower()` method on the string `s` to convert it to lowercase.
   - Return the resulting lowercase string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**

```python
def is_lower(s: str) -> str:
    # Convert the input string to lowercase using the lower() method
    return s.lower()
```

This function will take any string input and return it in lowercase, satisfying the problem requirements.
