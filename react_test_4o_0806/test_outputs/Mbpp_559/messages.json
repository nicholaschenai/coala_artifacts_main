        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the sum of the largest contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. A contiguous sublist is a sequence of elements that appear consecutively in the list. The task is to identify the sublist with the maximum sum and return that sum.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use Kadane's Algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Initialize two variables: `max_so_far` to store the maximum sum found so far, and `max_ending_here` to store the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position.\n2. Iterate through each element in the list:\n   - Update `max_ending_here` by adding the current element to it.\n   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `max_so_far`, update `max_so_far`.\n   - If `max_ending_here` becomes negative, reset it to zero, as a negative sum would not contribute to a maximum sum in future subarrays.\n3. After iterating through the list, `max_so_far` will contain the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):\n    max_so_far = -infinity\n    max_ending_here = 0\n\n    for each element in arr:\n        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + element\n        if max_so_far < max_ending_here:\n            max_so_far = max_ending_here\n        if max_ending_here < 0:\n            max_ending_here = 0\n\n    return max_so_far\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_sub_array_sum(arr: list, n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum sum so far to a very small number\n    max_so_far = float('-inf')\n    # Initialize the maximum sum ending at the current position to 0\n    max_ending_here = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the array\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Update the maximum sum ending here by adding the current element\n        max_ending_here += arr[i]\n        \n        # Update the maximum sum so far if the current max ending here is greater\n        if max_so_far < max_ending_here:\n            max_so_far = max_ending_here\n        \n        # If the current max ending here is negative, reset it to 0\n        if max_ending_here < 0:\n            max_ending_here = 0\n\n    # Return the maximum sum found\n    return max_so_far\n```\n\nThis code implements Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the given list. It efficiently computes the result in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes."
