INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/559 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the sum of the largest contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. A contiguous sublist is a sequence of elements that appear consecutively in the list. The task is to identify the sublist with the maximum sum and return that sum.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use Kadane's Algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize two variables: `max_so_far` to store the maximum sum found so far, and `max_ending_here` to store the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position.
2. Iterate through each element in the list:
   - Update `max_ending_here` by adding the current element to it.
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `max_so_far`, update `max_so_far`.
   - If `max_ending_here` becomes negative, reset it to zero, as a negative sum would not contribute to a maximum sum in future subarrays.
3. After iterating through the list, `max_so_far` will contain the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):
    max_so_far = -infinity
    max_ending_here = 0

    for each element in arr:
        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + element
        if max_so_far < max_ending_here:
            max_so_far = max_ending_here
        if max_ending_here < 0:
            max_ending_here = 0

    return max_so_far
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def max_sub_array_sum(arr: list, n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the maximum sum so far to a very small number
    max_so_far = float('-inf')
    # Initialize the maximum sum ending at the current position to 0
    max_ending_here = 0

    # Iterate over each element in the array
    for i in range(n):
        # Update the maximum sum ending here by adding the current element
        max_ending_here += arr[i]
        
        # Update the maximum sum so far if the current max ending here is greater
        if max_so_far < max_ending_here:
            max_so_far = max_ending_here
        
        # If the current max ending here is negative, reset it to 0
        if max_ending_here < 0:
            max_ending_here = 0

    # Return the maximum sum found
    return max_so_far
```

This code implements Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the given list. It efficiently computes the result in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.
