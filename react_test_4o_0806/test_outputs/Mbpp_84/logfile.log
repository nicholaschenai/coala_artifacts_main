You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/84 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence. The sequence is defined as follows:
   - P(1) = 1
   - P(2) = 1
   - For n > 2, P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n-P(n-1))

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence:
   - Start by defining the first two numbers of the sequence as 1.
   - For any number greater than 2, use the recursive formula to calculate the sequence value.
   - Store the sequence values in a list to avoid recalculating them multiple times.
   - Return the nth value from the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function sequence(n):
       if n == 1 or n == 2:
           return 1
       create a list seq with n+1 elements initialized to 0
       set seq[1] = 1
       set seq[2] = 1
       for i from 3 to n:
           seq[i] = seq[seq[i-1]] + seq[i-seq[i-1]]
       return seq[n]
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sequence(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases for the sequence
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize a list to store sequence values, with n+1 elements
    seq = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Set the first two known values of the sequence
    seq[1] = 1
    seq[2] = 1
    
    # Calculate the sequence values from 3 to n
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        seq[i] = seq[seq[i - 1]] + seq[i - seq[i - 1]]
    
    # Return the nth value in the sequence
    return seq[n]
