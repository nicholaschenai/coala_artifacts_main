    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence. The sequence is defined as follows:\n   - P(1) = 1\n   - P(2) = 1\n   - For n > 2, P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n-P(n-1))\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence:\n   - Start by defining the first two numbers of the sequence as 1.\n   - For any number greater than 2, use the recursive formula to calculate the sequence value.\n   - Store the sequence values in a list to avoid recalculating them multiple times.\n   - Return the nth value from the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function sequence(n):\n       if n == 1 or n == 2:\n           return 1\n       create a list seq with n+1 elements initialized to 0\n       set seq[1] = 1\n       set seq[2] = 1\n       for i from 3 to n:\n           seq[i] = seq[seq[i-1]] + seq[i-seq[i-1]]\n       return seq[n]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sequence(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base cases for the sequence\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize a list to store sequence values, with n+1 elements\n    seq = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # Set the first two known values of the sequence\n    seq[1] = 1\n    seq[2] = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the sequence values from 3 to n\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        seq[i] = seq[seq[i - 1]] + seq[i - seq[i - 1]]\n    \n    # Return the nth value in the sequence\n    return seq[n]\n```",
