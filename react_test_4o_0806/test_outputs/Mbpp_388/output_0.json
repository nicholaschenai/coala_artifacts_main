    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given integer `n`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1 (i.e., 2^0).\n   - Continuously multiply by 2 to get the next power of 2.\n   - Stop when the next power of 2 would be greater than `n`.\n   - The last power of 2 that was less than or equal to `n` is the answer.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Initialize power as 1\n   While power * 2 is less than or equal to n:\n       Multiply power by 2\n   Return power\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef highest_Power_of_2(n: int) -> int:\n    # Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1 (2^0)\n    power = 1\n    \n    # Keep multiplying by 2 until the next power would exceed n\n    while power * 2 <= n:\n        power *= 2\n    \n    # Return the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n\n    return power\n```\n\nThis function initializes `power` to 1 and keeps doubling it until doubling again would exceed `n`. The last valid `power` is returned as the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.",
