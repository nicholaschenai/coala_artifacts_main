INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/388 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/388 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given integer `n`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1 (i.e., 2^0).
   - Continuously multiply by 2 to get the next power of 2.
   - Stop when the next power of 2 would be greater than `n`.
   - The last power of 2 that was less than or equal to `n` is the answer.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize power as 1
   While power * 2 is less than or equal to n:
       Multiply power by 2
   Return power
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def highest_Power_of_2(n: int) -> int:
    # Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1 (2^0)
    power = 1
    
    # Keep multiplying by 2 until the next power would exceed n
    while power * 2 <= n:
        power *= 2
    
    # Return the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n
    return power
```

This function initializes `power` to 1 and keeps doubling it until doubling again would exceed `n`. The last valid `power` is returned as the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

    while power * 2 <= n:
