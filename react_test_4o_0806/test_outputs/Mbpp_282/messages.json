        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers as input and returns a new list. This new list should contain the result of subtracting each element of the second list from the corresponding element of the first list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, ensure that both input lists are of the same length, as element-wise operations require this.\n   - Create an empty list to store the results.\n   - Iterate over the indices of the lists.\n   - For each index, subtract the element in the second list from the element in the first list and append the result to the results list.\n   - Return the results list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `sub_list` that takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`.\n   - Initialize an empty list called `result`.\n   - Loop over the range of the length of `list1` (or `list2` since they are the same length).\n     - For each index `i`, calculate the difference between `list1[i]` and `list2[i]`.\n     - Append this difference to `result`.\n   - Return the `result` list.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sub_list(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the subtraction\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Subtract the element in list2 from the element in list1 at the same index\n        difference = list1[i] - list2[i]\n        # Append the result to the result list\n        result.append(difference)\n    \n    # Return the list containing the element-wise differences\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly subtract the elements of the second list from the first list, element by element, and return the resulting list."
