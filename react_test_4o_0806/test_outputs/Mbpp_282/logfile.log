You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/282 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers as input and returns a new list. This new list should contain the result of subtracting each element of the second list from the corresponding element of the first list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, ensure that both input lists are of the same length, as element-wise operations require this.
   - Create an empty list to store the results.
   - Iterate over the indices of the lists.
   - For each index, subtract the element in the second list from the element in the first list and append the result to the results list.
   - Return the results list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `sub_list` that takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`.
   - Initialize an empty list called `result`.
   - Loop over the range of the length of `list1` (or `list2` since they are the same length).
     - For each index `i`, calculate the difference between `list1[i]` and `list2[i]`.
     - Append this difference to `result`.
   - Return the `result` list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sub_list(list1, list2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the subtraction
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Subtract the element in list2 from the element in list1 at the same index
        difference = list1[i] - list2[i]
        # Append the result to the result list
        result.append(difference)
    
    # Return the list containing the element-wise differences
    return result
```

This function will correctly subtract the elements of the second list from the first list, element by element, and return the resulting list.

        # Subtract the element in list2 from the element in list1 at the same index

        # Append the result to the result list
        result.append(difference)

```python
def sub_list(list1, list2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the subtraction
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Subtract the element in list2 from the element in list1 at the same index
        difference = list1[i] - list2[i]
        # Append the result to the result list
        result.append(difference)
    
    # Return the list containing the element-wise differences
    return result
```

This function will correctly subtract the elements of the second list from the first list, element by element, and return the resulting list.
