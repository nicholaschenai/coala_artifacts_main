You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/644 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes an array and an integer `k` as inputs. The function should reverse the elements of the array from the start up to the `k`-th position (exclusive), and leave the rest of the array unchanged.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will take the input array and the integer `k`.
   - We will reverse the portion of the array from the start up to the `k`-th position.
   - We will concatenate this reversed portion with the rest of the array starting from the `k`-th position.
   - Finally, we will return the modified array.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):
       - Reverse the subarray from index 0 to k-1
       - Concatenate the reversed subarray with the rest of the array starting from index k
       - Return the concatenated array
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):
    # Reverse the subarray from the start up to the k-th position (exclusive)
    reversed_part = arr[:k][::-1]
    
    # Concatenate the reversed part with the rest of the array starting from k
    result = reversed_part + arr[k:]
    
    # Return the final array
    return result
```

This function will reverse the elements of the array up to the specified position `k` and return the modified array.

    result = reversed_part + arr[k:]
    
    # Return the final array
    return result
```

This function will reverse the elements of the array up to the specified position `k` and return the modified array.
