The function should reverse the elements of the array from the start up to the `k`-th position (exclusive), and leave the rest of the array unchanged.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will take the input array and the integer `k`.\n   - We will reverse the portion of the array from the start up to the `k`-th position.\n   - We will concatenate this reversed portion with the rest of the array starting from the `k`-th position.\n   - Finally, we will return the modified array.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):\n       - Reverse the subarray from index 0 to k-1\n       - Concatenate the reversed subarray with the rest of the array starting from index k\n       - Return the concatenated array\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):\n    # Reverse the subarray from the start up to the k-th position (exclusive)\n    reversed_part = arr[:k][::-1]\n    \n    # Concatenate the reversed part with the rest of the array starting from k\n    result = reversed_part + arr[k:]\n    \n    # Return the final array\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will reverse the elements of the array up to the specified position `k` and return the modified array."
