    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the smallest list within that list of lists.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate through each list in the list of lists.\n2. For each list, we will calculate its length.\n3. We will keep track of the smallest length encountered during the iteration.\n4. Finally, we will return the smallest length found.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `Find_Min_Length` that takes a parameter `list_of_lists`.\n2. Initialize a variable `min_length` with a very large number (or the length of the first list).\n3. For each `lst` in `list_of_lists`:\n   - Calculate the length of `lst`.\n   - If this length is smaller than `min_length`, update `min_length`.\n4. Return `min_length`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize min_length with a large number\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        # Calculate the length of the current list\n        current_length = len(lst)\n        \n        # Update min_length if the current list's length is smaller\n        if current_length < min_length:\n            min_length = current_length\n    \n    # Return the smallest length found\n    return min_length\n```",
