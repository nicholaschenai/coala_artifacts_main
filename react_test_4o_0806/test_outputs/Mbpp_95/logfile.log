You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/95 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the smallest list within that list of lists.

### Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through each list in the list of lists.
2. For each list, we will calculate its length.
3. We will keep track of the smallest length encountered during the iteration.
4. Finally, we will return the smallest length found.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `Find_Min_Length` that takes a parameter `list_of_lists`.
2. Initialize a variable `min_length` with a very large number (or the length of the first list).
3. For each `lst` in `list_of_lists`:
   - Calculate the length of `lst`.
   - If this length is smaller than `min_length`, update `min_length`.
4. Return `min_length`.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):
    # Initialize min_length with a large number
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        # Calculate the length of the current list
        current_length = len(lst)
        
        # Update min_length if the current list's length is smaller
        if current_length < min_length:
            min_length = current_length
    
    # Return the smallest length found
    return min_length
