You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/127 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes two integers as input and returns their product.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The task is straightforward: multiply the two given integers and return the result. This can be done using the multiplication operator `*` in Python.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `multiply_int` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
   - Inside the function, calculate the product of `a` and `b` using the `*` operator.
   - Return the result of the multiplication.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def multiply_int(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the product of a and b
    result = a * b
    # Return the result
    return result
```

This function will correctly multiply two integers and return the result, as required by the problem statement.
INFO - program_code:
 
def multiply_int(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the product of a and b
    result = a * b
    # Return the result
