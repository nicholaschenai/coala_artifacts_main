This can be done using the multiplication operator `*` in Python.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `multiply_int` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n   - Inside the function, calculate the product of `a` and `b` using the `*` operator.\n   - Return the result of the multiplication.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef multiply_int(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the product of a and b\n    result = a * b\n    # Return the result\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly multiply two integers and return the result, as required by the problem statement."
