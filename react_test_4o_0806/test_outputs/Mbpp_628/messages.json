The function should return the modified string.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.\n   - If the character is a space, we will append '%20' to a new string.\n   - If the character is not a space, we will append the character itself to the new string.\n   - Finally, we will return the new string which will have all spaces replaced by '%20'.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function replace_spaces(input_string):\n       initialize an empty string called result\n       for each character in input_string:\n           if the character is a space:\n               append '%20' to result\n           else:\n               append the character to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef replace_spaces(input_string: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to build the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # If the character is a space, append '%20' to the result\n        if char == ' ':\n            result += '%20'\n        # Otherwise, append the character itself to the result\n        else:\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the final result string with spaces replaced by '%20'\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the input string once, appending either '%20' or the character itself to the result string, ensuring that all spaces are replaced as required."
