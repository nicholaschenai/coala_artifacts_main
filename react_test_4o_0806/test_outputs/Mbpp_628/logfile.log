You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a function to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'.

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/628 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every space character in the string with the sequence '%20'. The function should return the modified string.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.
   - If the character is a space, we will append '%20' to a new string.
   - If the character is not a space, we will append the character itself to the new string.
   - Finally, we will return the new string which will have all spaces replaced by '%20'.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function replace_spaces(input_string):
       initialize an empty string called result
       for each character in input_string:
           if the character is a space:
               append '%20' to result
           else:
               append the character to result
       return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def replace_spaces(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to build the result
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # If the character is a space, append '%20' to the result
        if char == ' ':
            result += '%20'
        # Otherwise, append the character itself to the result
        else:
            result += char
    
    # Return the final result string with spaces replaced by '%20'
    return result
```

This solution iterates through the input string once, appending either '%20' or the character itself to the result string, ensuring that all spaces are replaced as required.

        # If the character is a space, append '%20' to the result
        if char == ' ':
            result += '%20'
        # Otherwise, append the character itself to the result
        else:
            result += char
    
    # Return the final result string with spaces replaced by '%20'
    return result
