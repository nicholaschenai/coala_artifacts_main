You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/2 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of elements that are common to both lists. The order of elements in the output list does not matter, and there should be no duplicates in the output.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the common elements between two lists, we can convert each list to a set. Sets in Python automatically handle duplicates and allow for efficient operations like intersection. By finding the intersection of the two sets, we can easily determine which elements are shared between the two lists. Finally, we convert the resulting set back to a list to match the expected output type.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function similar_elements that takes two lists as input
       Convert the first list to a set
       Convert the second list to a set
       Find the intersection of the two sets
       Convert the intersection set to a list
       Return the list of common elements
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    # Convert the first list to a set to remove duplicates and allow set operations
    set1 = set(list1)
    # Convert the second list to a set
    set2 = set(list2)
    # Find the intersection of the two sets to get common elements
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    # Convert the set of common elements back to a list
    return list(common_elements)
```
