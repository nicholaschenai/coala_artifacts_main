INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/79 [prompt] 
You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/79 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if the length of a given word is odd. If the length is odd, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, determine the length of the input word.
   - Check if this length is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the length modulo 2 is not equal to zero, then the length is odd.
   - Return `True` if the length is odd, otherwise return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function word_len(word):
       length = length of the word
       if length % 2 is not equal to 0:
           return True
       else:
           return False
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def word_len(word: str) -> bool:
    # Calculate the length of the word
    length = len(word)
    
    # Check if the length is odd
    if length % 2 != 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function `word_len` takes a string `word` as input, calculates its length, and checks if the length is odd. If the length is odd, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

def word_len(word: str) -> bool:

    # Check if the length is odd
    if length % 2 != 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
