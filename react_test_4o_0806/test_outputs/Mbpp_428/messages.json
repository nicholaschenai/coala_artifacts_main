        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to implement the Shell Sort algorithm to sort a given list of integers in ascending order. The function should take a list of integers as input and return a new list with the integers sorted.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Shell Sort is an optimization of the Insertion Sort algorithm. It works by comparing elements that are a certain gap apart and sorting them. The gap is reduced gradually until it becomes 1, at which point the list is sorted using a standard Insertion Sort. The key idea is that by the time the gap is reduced to 1, the list is already partially sorted, which makes the final insertion sort pass more efficient.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function shell_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       gap = n // 2\n       while gap > 0:\n           for i from gap to n-1:\n               temp = arr[i]\n               j = i\n               while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                   arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                   j = j - gap\n               arr[j] = temp\n           gap = gap // 2\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef shell_sort(arr):\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Initialize the gap size\n    gap = n // 2\n    \n    # Continue the process until the gap is reduced to 0\n    while gap > 0:\n        # Perform a gapped insertion sort for this gap size\n        for i in range(gap, n):\n            # Store the current element in a temporary variable\n            temp = arr[i]\n            # Initialize j to the current index\n            j = i\n            # Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found\n            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                j -= gap\n            # Place the temp element at its correct position\n            arr[j] = temp\n        # Reduce the gap for the next iteration\n        gap //= 2\n    \n    # Return the sorted array\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the Shell Sort algorithm as described, sorting the input list in ascending order."
