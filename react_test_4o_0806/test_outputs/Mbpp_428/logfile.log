You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/428 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to implement the Shell Sort algorithm to sort a given list of integers in ascending order. The function should take a list of integers as input and return a new list with the integers sorted.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Shell Sort is an optimization of the Insertion Sort algorithm. It works by comparing elements that are a certain gap apart and sorting them. The gap is reduced gradually until it becomes 1, at which point the list is sorted using a standard Insertion Sort. The key idea is that by the time the gap is reduced to 1, the list is already partially sorted, which makes the final insertion sort pass more efficient.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function shell_sort(arr):
       n = length of arr
       gap = n // 2
       while gap > 0:
           for i from gap to n-1:
               temp = arr[i]
               j = i
               while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                   arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                   j = j - gap
               arr[j] = temp
           gap = gap // 2
       return arr
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def shell_sort(arr):
    # Get the length of the array
    n = len(arr)
    # Initialize the gap size
    gap = n // 2
    
    # Continue the process until the gap is reduced to 0
    while gap > 0:
        # Perform a gapped insertion sort for this gap size
        for i in range(gap, n):
            # Store the current element in a temporary variable
            temp = arr[i]
            # Initialize j to the current index
            j = i
            # Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                j -= gap
            # Place the temp element at its correct position
            arr[j] = temp
        # Reduce the gap for the next iteration
