        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a nested tuple containing integers and other nested tuples. The function should return a new tuple with all odd integers removed, preserving the original structure of the nested tuples.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will define a recursive function that processes each element of the tuple.\n   - If an element is an integer, we will check if it is even. If it is even, we will include it in the result; otherwise, we will exclude it.\n   - If an element is a tuple, we will recursively process it to remove odd integers from it.\n   - The function will return a new tuple with only even integers, maintaining the original nested structure.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function `extract_even` that takes a tuple `t` as input.\n   Initialize an empty list `result` to store the processed elements.\n   For each element `elem` in the tuple `t`:\n       If `elem` is an integer:\n           If `elem` is even, append it to `result`.\n       If `elem` is a tuple:\n           Recursively call `extract_even` on `elem` and append the result to `result`.\n   Convert `result` back to a tuple and return it.\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_even(t):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the processed elements\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the tuple\n    for elem in t:\n        # Check if the element is an integer\n        if isinstance(elem, int):\n            # If the integer is even, add it to the result list\n            if elem % 2 == 0:\n                result.append(elem)\n        # Check if the element is a tuple\n        elif isinstance(elem, tuple):\n            # Recursively process the nested tuple and add the result to the list\n            result.append(extract_even(elem))\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThis solution processes each element of the input tuple, checking if it is an integer or a tuple, and applies the necessary logic to filter out odd integers while preserving the nested structure."
