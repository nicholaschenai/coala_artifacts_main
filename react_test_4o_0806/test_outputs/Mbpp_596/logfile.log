You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/596 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function named `tuple_size` that takes a tuple as input and returns the size of that tuple in bytes. The size should be determined using Python's built-in method for measuring the size of an object in memory.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Python provides a built-in function `sys.getsizeof()` that returns the size of an object in bytes. This function includes the overhead of the object itself.
   - We will use this function to determine the size of the input tuple.
   - The function `tuple_size` will take a tuple as an argument and return the result of `sys.getsizeof()` applied to that tuple.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   - Import the `sys` module to access the `getsizeof` function.
   - Define the function `tuple_size` that takes a single parameter `tup`.
   - Inside the function, use `sys.getsizeof(tup)` to get the size of the tuple.
   - Return the size obtained from `sys.getsizeof(tup)`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
import sys

# Define the function tuple_size
def tuple_size(tup: tuple) -> int:
    # Use sys.getsizeof to get the size of the tuple in bytes
    return sys.getsizeof(tup)
```

This solution imports the `sys` module and defines the `tuple_size` function, which returns the size of the input tuple in bytes using `sys.getsizeof()`.
INFO - program_code:
 
import sys

# Define the function tuple_size
def tuple_size(tup: tuple) -> int:
    # Use sys.getsizeof to get the size of the tuple in bytes
