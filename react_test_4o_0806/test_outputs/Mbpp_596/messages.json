The size should be determined using Python's built-in method for measuring the size of an object in memory.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Python provides a built-in function `sys.getsizeof()` that returns the size of an object in bytes. This function includes the overhead of the object itself.\n   - We will use this function to determine the size of the input tuple.\n   - The function `tuple_size` will take a tuple as an argument and return the result of `sys.getsizeof()` applied to that tuple.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   - Import the `sys` module to access the `getsizeof` function.\n   - Define the function `tuple_size` that takes a single parameter `tup`.\n   - Inside the function, use `sys.getsizeof(tup)` to get the size of the tuple.\n   - Return the size obtained from `sys.getsizeof(tup)`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the function tuple_size\ndef tuple_size(tup: tuple) -> int:\n    # Use sys.getsizeof to get the size of the tuple in bytes\n    return sys.getsizeof(tup)\n```\n\nThis solution imports the `sys` module and defines the `tuple_size` function, which returns the size of the input tuple in bytes using `sys.getsizeof()`."
