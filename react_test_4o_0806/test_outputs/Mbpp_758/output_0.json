    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input. The function should return a dictionary where each unique list from the input is converted to a tuple (since lists can't be dictionary keys) and the value is the count of how many times that list appears in the input list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the tuples and their counts.\n   - Iterate over each sublist in the input list.\n   - Convert each sublist to a tuple.\n   - Check if the tuple is already a key in the dictionary:\n     - If it is, increment its count by 1.\n     - If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n   - Return the dictionary after processing all sublists.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function unique_sublists(list_of_lists):\n       create an empty dictionary called count_dict\n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           convert sublist to a tuple called tuple_key\n           if tuple_key is in count_dict:\n               increment count_dict[tuple_key] by 1\n           else:\n               set count_dict[tuple_key] to 1\n       return count_dict\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef unique_sublists(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each tuple\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Convert the sublist to a tuple to use as a dictionary key\n        tuple_key = tuple(sublist)\n        \n        # Check if the tuple is already a key in the dictionary\n        if tuple_key in count_dict:\n            # If it is, increment its count by 1\n            count_dict[tuple_key] += 1\n        else:\n            # If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1\n            count_dict[tuple_key] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing tuples and their counts\n    return count_dict\n```",
