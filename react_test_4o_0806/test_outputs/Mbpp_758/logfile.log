You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/758 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input. The function should return a dictionary where each unique list from the input is converted to a tuple (since lists can't be dictionary keys) and the value is the count of how many times that list appears in the input list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the tuples and their counts.
   - Iterate over each sublist in the input list.
   - Convert each sublist to a tuple.
   - Check if the tuple is already a key in the dictionary:
     - If it is, increment its count by 1.
     - If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.
   - Return the dictionary after processing all sublists.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function unique_sublists(list_of_lists):
       create an empty dictionary called count_dict
       for each sublist in list_of_lists:
           convert sublist to a tuple called tuple_key
           if tuple_key is in count_dict:
               increment count_dict[tuple_key] by 1
           else:
               set count_dict[tuple_key] to 1
       return count_dict
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def unique_sublists(list_of_lists):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each tuple
    count_dict = {}
