This position should be the leftmost position where the value can be inserted.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate through the list from the beginning to the end.\n   - For each element in the list, we will check if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value.\n   - If we find such an element, the current index is the left insertion point for the specified value.\n   - If we reach the end of the list without finding such an element, the insertion point is at the end of the list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function left_insertion(sorted_list, value):\n       for index from 0 to length of sorted_list - 1:\n           if sorted_list[index] >= value:\n               return index\n       return length of sorted_list\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef left_insertion(sorted_list, value):\n    # Iterate over each index and element in the sorted list\n    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):\n        # If the current element is greater than or equal to the value\n        if sorted_list[index] >= value:\n            # Return the current index as the insertion point\n            return index\n    # If no such element is found, return the length of the list\n    # indicating the value should be inserted at the end\n    return len(sorted_list)\n```\n\nThis function will correctly find the leftmost insertion point for a given value in a sorted list."
