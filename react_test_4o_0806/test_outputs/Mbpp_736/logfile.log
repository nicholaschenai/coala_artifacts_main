You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/736 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that finds the position in a sorted list where a given value can be inserted while maintaining the list's sorted order. This position should be the leftmost position where the value can be inserted.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through the list from the beginning to the end.
   - For each element in the list, we will check if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value.
   - If we find such an element, the current index is the left insertion point for the specified value.
   - If we reach the end of the list without finding such an element, the insertion point is at the end of the list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function left_insertion(sorted_list, value):
       for index from 0 to length of sorted_list - 1:
           if sorted_list[index] >= value:
               return index
       return length of sorted_list
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def left_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    # Iterate over each index and element in the sorted list
    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):
        # If the current element is greater than or equal to the value
        if sorted_list[index] >= value:
            # Return the current index as the insertion point
            return index
    # If no such element is found, return the length of the list
    # indicating the value should be inserted at the end
    return len(sorted_list)
```

This function will correctly find the leftmost insertion point for a given value in a sorted list.

        if sorted_list[index] >= value:
            # Return the current index as the insertion point

    return len(sorted_list)
```
