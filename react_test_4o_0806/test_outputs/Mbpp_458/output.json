    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying its length by its width. Therefore, the function should take two arguments, the length and the width, and return the product of these two values.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define a function named rectangle_area that takes two parameters: length and width\n       Calculate the area by multiplying length and width\n       Return the calculated area\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef rectangle_area(length: int, width: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying length and width\n    area = length * width\n    # Return the calculated area\n    return area\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the area of a rectangle when given its length and width as inputs.",
