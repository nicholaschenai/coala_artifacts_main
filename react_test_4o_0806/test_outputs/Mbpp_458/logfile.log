You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying its length by its width. Therefore, the function should take two arguments, the length and the width, and return the product of these two values.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function named rectangle_area that takes two parameters: length and width
       Calculate the area by multiplying length and width
       Return the calculated area
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def rectangle_area(length: int, width: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying length and width
    area = length * width
    # Return the calculated area
    return area
```

This function will correctly compute the area of a rectangle when given its length and width as inputs.
INFO - program_code:
 
def rectangle_area(length: int, width: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying length and width
    area = length * width
