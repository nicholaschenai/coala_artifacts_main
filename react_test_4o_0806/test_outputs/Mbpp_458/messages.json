Therefore, the function should take two arguments, the length and the width, and return the product of these two values.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define a function named rectangle_area that takes two parameters: length and width\n       Calculate the area by multiplying length and width\n       Return the calculated area\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef rectangle_area(length: int, width: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying length and width\n    area = length * width\n    # Return the calculated area\n    return area\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the area of a rectangle when given its length and width as inputs."
