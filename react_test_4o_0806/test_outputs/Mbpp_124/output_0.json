    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the angle (also known as the argument) of a complex number. The angle is the direction of the complex number in the complex plane, measured in radians from the positive real axis.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Complex Numbers**: A complex number is of the form \\( a + bi \\), where \\( a \\) is the real part and \\( b \\) is the imaginary part. The angle of a complex number is the angle formed by the line representing the complex number and the positive real axis.\n\n2. **Calculating the Angle**: The angle \\( \\theta \\) can be calculated using the `atan2` function, which computes the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments, taking into account the signs of both arguments to determine the correct quadrant. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\theta = \\text{atan2}(\\text{imaginary part}, \\text{real part})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Using Built-in Functions**: Python's `cmath` module provides a function `phase` that directly computes the angle of a complex number. However, since we are restricted to built-in functions, we will use `math.atan2`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `angle_complex` that takes a complex number `z` as input.\n2. Extract the real part and the imaginary part of the complex number.\n3. Use `math.atan2` to calculate the angle using the imaginary part as the first argument and the real part as the second argument.\n4. Return the calculated angle.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef angle_complex(z: complex) -> float:\n    # Extract the real and imaginary parts of the complex number\n    real_part = z.real\n    imaginary_part = z.imag\n    \n    # Calculate the angle using atan2\n    angle = math.atan2(imaginary_part, real_part)\n    \n    # Return the calculated angle\n    return angle\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `math.atan2` function to compute the angle of the complex number, which correctly handles all quadrants and edge cases.",
