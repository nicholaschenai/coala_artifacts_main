You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/750 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the original list followed by all the elements of the tuple.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The task is to combine the elements of a tuple with a list. In Python, we can achieve this by converting the tuple into a list and then concatenating it with the original list. This will result in a new list that contains all the elements from both the original list and the tuple.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `add_tuple` that takes two parameters: a list and a tuple.
   - Convert the tuple into a list.
   - Concatenate the list version of the tuple to the original list.
   - Return the concatenated list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def add_tuple(lst: list, tpl: tuple) -> list:
    # Convert the tuple to a list
    tuple_as_list = list(tpl)
    # Concatenate the list with the converted tuple list
    result = lst + tuple_as_list
    # Return the resulting list
    return result
```

This function will take a list and a tuple, convert the tuple to a list, concatenate it with the original list, and return the combined list.

def add_tuple(lst: list, tpl: tuple) -> list:
    # Convert the tuple to a list

    # Concatenate the list with the converted tuple list
    result = lst + tuple_as_list
    # Return the resulting list
    return result

    result = lst + tuple_as_list
    # Return the resulting list
    return result
```
