In Python, we can achieve this by converting the tuple into a list and then concatenating it with the original list. This will result in a new list that contains all the elements from both the original list and the tuple.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `add_tuple` that takes two parameters: a list and a tuple.\n   - Convert the tuple into a list.\n   - Concatenate the list version of the tuple to the original list.\n   - Return the concatenated list.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef add_tuple(lst: list, tpl: tuple) -> list:\n    # Convert the tuple to a list\n    tuple_as_list = list(tpl)\n    # Concatenate the list with the converted tuple list\n    result = lst + tuple_as_list\n    # Return the resulting list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take a list and a tuple, convert the tuple to a list, concatenate it with the original list, and return the combined list."
