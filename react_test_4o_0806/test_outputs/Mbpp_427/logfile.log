You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/427 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a date string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" and converts it to the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The input is a string representing a date in the format "yyyy-mm-dd".
   - We need to split this string into its components: year, month, and day.
   - Rearrange these components to form a new string in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".
   - Return the newly formatted date string.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `change_date_format` that takes a single string argument `date`.
   - Split the input string `date` using the hyphen '-' as the delimiter. This will give us a list with three elements: year, month, and day.
   - Rearrange the elements of the list to form a new string in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".
   - Return the newly formatted string.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def change_date_format(date: str) -> str:
    # Split the input date string by the '-' delimiter
    parts = date.split('-')
    
    # Rearrange the parts to form the new date format "dd-mm-yyyy"
    new_date = f"{parts[2]}-{parts[1]}-{parts[0]}"
    
    # Return the newly formatted date string
    return new_date
```

This function will take a date string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd", split it into its components, rearrange them, and return the date in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

    new_date = f"{parts[2]}-{parts[1]}-{parts[0]}"

    # Return the newly formatted date string
    return new_date
```

This function will take a date string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd", split it into its components, rearrange them, and return the date in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".
