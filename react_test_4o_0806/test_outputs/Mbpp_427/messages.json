This will give us a list with three elements: year, month, and day.\n   - Rearrange the elements of the list to form a new string in the format \"dd-mm-yyyy\".\n   - Return the newly formatted string.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef change_date_format(date: str) -> str:\n    # Split the input date string by the '-' delimiter\n    parts = date.split('-')\n    \n    # Rearrange the parts to form the new date format \"dd-mm-yyyy\"\n    new_date = f\"{parts[2]}-{parts[1]}-{parts[0]}\"\n    \n    # Return the newly formatted date string\n    return new_date\n```\n\nThis function will take a date string in the format \"yyyy-mm-dd\", split it into its components, rearrange them, and return the date in the format \"dd-mm-yyyy\"."
