        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but they start with 2 and 1. The sequence is defined as follows:\n   - L(0) = 2\n   - L(1) = 1\n   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To find the nth Lucas number, we can use an iterative approach. We start with the first two Lucas numbers, 2 and 1. For each subsequent number up to n, we calculate it by summing the two preceding numbers. This approach avoids the inefficiency of a recursive solution by using a loop to build up the sequence iteratively.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_lucas(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 2\n       if n is 1:\n           return 1\n       initialize two variables, a and b, to 2 and 1 respectively\n       for i from 2 to n:\n           calculate the next Lucas number as a + b\n           update a to b\n           update b to the newly calculated Lucas number\n       return b\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_lucas(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base cases for the first two Lucas numbers\n    if n == 0:\n        return 2\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two Lucas numbers\n    a, b = 2, 1\n    \n    # Iteratively calculate the nth Lucas number\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the next Lucas number\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    \n    # Return the nth Lucas number\n    return b\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the nth Lucas number using an iterative approach, which is both time and space efficient."
