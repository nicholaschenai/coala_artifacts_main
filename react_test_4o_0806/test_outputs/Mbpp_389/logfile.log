You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the nth Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but they start with 2 and 1. The sequence is defined as follows:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To find the nth Lucas number, we can use an iterative approach. We start with the first two Lucas numbers, 2 and 1. For each subsequent number up to n, we calculate it by summing the two preceding numbers. This approach avoids the inefficiency of a recursive solution by using a loop to build up the sequence iteratively.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_lucas(n):
       if n is 0:
           return 2
       if n is 1:
           return 1
       initialize two variables, a and b, to 2 and 1 respectively
       for i from 2 to n:
           calculate the next Lucas number as a + b
           update a to b
           update b to the newly calculated Lucas number
       return b
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_lucas(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases for the first two Lucas numbers
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first two Lucas numbers
    a, b = 2, 1
    
    # Iteratively calculate the nth Lucas number
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        # Calculate the next Lucas number
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    # Return the nth Lucas number
    return b
```

This solution efficiently calculates the nth Lucas number using an iterative approach, which is both time and space efficient.
