You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/641 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the nth nonagonal number. A nonagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the nonagon (a nine-sided polygon). The nth nonagonal number can be calculated using a specific formula.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   To find the nth nonagonal number, we can use the formula for nonagonal numbers: 
   \[
   N(n) = \frac{7n^2 - 5n}{2}
   \]
   This formula gives us the nth nonagonal number directly. We will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth nonagonal number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function is_nonagonal(n):
       Calculate nonagonal number using formula: (7 * n^2 - 5 * n) / 2
       Return the calculated nonagonal number
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_nonagonal(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth nonagonal number using the formula
    nonagonal_number = (7 * n * n - 5 * n) // 2
    # Return the calculated nonagonal number
    return nonagonal_number
```

This function will correctly compute the nth nonagonal number using the given formula.
