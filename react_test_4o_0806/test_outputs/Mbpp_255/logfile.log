You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of items and an integer `n`, and generates all possible combinations of the list's elements with repetition allowed, where each combination is of length `n`. The function should return these combinations as a list of tuples.

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We need to generate combinations of a specified length `n` from a given list, allowing elements to be repeated in each combination.
   - This is similar to generating the Cartesian product of the list with itself `n` times.
   - We can achieve this by using a recursive approach or by iterating through the list multiple times to build combinations of the desired length.
   - For each position in the combination, we can choose any element from the list, and we repeat this process `n` times to form a complete combination.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `combinations_colors` that takes a list `colors` and an integer `n`.
   - Initialize an empty list `result` to store the combinations.
   - Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes the current combination being built and the current depth.
     - If the current depth equals `n`, add the current combination to the result list.
     - Otherwise, for each color in the list, append the color to the current combination and recursively call `generate_combinations` with the updated combination and incremented depth.
   - Call `generate_combinations` with an empty tuple and depth 0.
   - Return the `result` list.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def combinations_colors(colors: list, n: int) -> list:
    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, depth):
        # If the current combination is of the desired length, add it to the result
        if depth == n:
            result.append(current_combination)
            return
        # Otherwise, continue building the combination
        for color in colors:
            generate_combinations(current_combination + (color,), depth + 1)
    
    # List to store the result combinations
    result = []
    # Start generating combinations with an empty tuple and depth 0
    generate_combinations((), 0)
    return result
```

This solution uses a recursive helper function to build combinations of the specified length, allowing repetition of elements from the input list. The function appends each complete combination to the result list once it reaches the desired length.
