        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given integer is divisible by 11. The function should return `True` if the number is divisible by 11 and `False` otherwise.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11. The rule states that a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero). \n\n   Steps:\n   - Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.\n   - Initialize two sums: one for digits in odd positions and one for digits in even positions.\n   - Iterate over the digits, adding to the appropriate sum based on the position (odd or even).\n   - Calculate the absolute difference between the two sums.\n   - Check if this difference is divisible by 11.\n   - Return `True` if it is divisible by 11, otherwise return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function is_Diff(n):\n       convert n to string\n       initialize odd_sum to 0\n       initialize even_sum to 0\n       for each index and digit in the string representation of n:\n           if index is even:\n               add digit to odd_sum\n           else:\n               add digit to even_sum\n       calculate difference = absolute value of (odd_sum - even_sum)\n       if difference is divisible by 11:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_Diff(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string to iterate over each digit\n    n_str = str(n)\n    \n    # Initialize sums for odd and even positioned digits\n    odd_sum = 0\n    even_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the digits with their index\n    for index, digit in enumerate(n_str):\n        # Convert the character to an integer\n        digit_value = int(digit)\n        \n        # Check if the index is even or odd\n        if index % 2 == 0:\n            # Add to odd_sum if index is even (0-based index)\n            odd_sum += digit_value\n        else:\n            # Add to even_sum if index is odd\n            even_sum += digit_value\n    \n    # Calculate the absolute difference between the sums\n    difference = abs(odd_sum - even_sum)\n    \n    # Check if the difference is divisible by 11\n    return difference % 11 == 0\n```\n\nThis code implements the divisibility rule for 11 and checks if the given number is divisible by 11, returning the appropriate boolean value."
