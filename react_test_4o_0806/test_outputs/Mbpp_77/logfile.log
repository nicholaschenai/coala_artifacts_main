You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that checks if a given integer is divisible by 11. The function should return `True` if the number is divisible by 11 and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11. The rule states that a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero). 

   Steps:
   - Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.
   - Initialize two sums: one for digits in odd positions and one for digits in even positions.
   - Iterate over the digits, adding to the appropriate sum based on the position (odd or even).
   - Calculate the absolute difference between the two sums.
   - Check if this difference is divisible by 11.
   - Return `True` if it is divisible by 11, otherwise return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function is_Diff(n):
       convert n to string
       initialize odd_sum to 0
       initialize even_sum to 0
       for each index and digit in the string representation of n:
           if index is even:
               add digit to odd_sum
           else:
               add digit to even_sum
       calculate difference = absolute value of (odd_sum - even_sum)
       if difference is divisible by 11:
           return True
       else:
           return False
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_Diff(n: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the number to a string to iterate over each digit
    n_str = str(n)
    
    # Initialize sums for odd and even positioned digits
    odd_sum = 0
    even_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over the digits with their index
    for index, digit in enumerate(n_str):
        # Convert the character to an integer
        digit_value = int(digit)
        
        # Check if the index is even or odd
        if index % 2 == 0:
            # Add to odd_sum if index is even (0-based index)
            odd_sum += digit_value
        else:
            # Add to even_sum if index is odd
            even_sum += digit_value
    
    # Calculate the absolute difference between the sums
    difference = abs(odd_sum - even_sum)
    
    # Check if the difference is divisible by 11
    return difference % 11 == 0
```

This code implements the divisibility rule for 11 and checks if the given number is divisible by 11, returning the appropriate boolean value.
