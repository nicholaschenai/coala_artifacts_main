This subsequence must also include the element at index `k`.\n\n2. **Calculate the Maximum Sum**: For each element up to index `i`, calculate the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence that ends at that element. Then, check if this subsequence can be extended to include the element at index `k`.\n\n3. **Include the kth Element**: For each subsequence ending at an index `j` (where `j <= i`), if the element at index `j` is less than the element at index `k`, add the element at index `k` to the sum of the subsequence ending at `j`.\n\n4. **Find the Maximum**: The result will be the maximum sum obtained by including the element at index `k` in any of the valid subsequences.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n    initialize max_sum array of size i+1 with zeros\n\n    for j from 0 to i:\n        set max_sum[j] to arr[j]\n        for m from 0 to j-1:\n            if arr[m] < arr[j]:\n                max_sum[j] = max(max_sum[j], max_sum[m] + arr[j])\n\n    result = 0\n    for j from 0 to i:\n        if arr[j] < arr[k]:\n            result = max(result, max_sum[j] + arr[k])\n\n    return result\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n    # Initialize an array to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences\n    # ending at each index up to i\n    max_sum = [0] * (i + 1)\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum sum of increasing subsequences for each index up to i\n    for j in range(i + 1):\n        max_sum[j] = arr[j]\n        for m in range(j):\n            if arr[m] < arr[j]:\n                max_sum[j] = max(max_sum[j], max_sum[m] + arr[j])\n    \n    # Find the maximum sum of subsequences that can be extended to include arr[k]\n    result = 0\n    for j in range(i + 1):\n        if arr[j] < arr[k]:\n            result = max(result, max_sum[j] + arr[k])\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution calculates the maximum sum of increasing subsequences up to index `i` and checks if they can be extended to include the element at index `k`. The result is the maximum sum of such subsequences."
