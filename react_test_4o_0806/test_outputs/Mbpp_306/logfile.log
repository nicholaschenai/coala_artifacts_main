We need to find the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence from the start of a list up to a given index `i`, and this subsequence must also include a specific element at index `k` where `k > i`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Subsequence**: We need to find an increasing subsequence that starts from the beginning of the list and goes up to index `i`. This subsequence must also include the element at index `k`.

2. **Calculate the Maximum Sum**: For each element up to index `i`, calculate the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence that ends at that element. Then, check if this subsequence can be extended to include the element at index `k`.

3. **Include the kth Element**: For each subsequence ending at an index `j` (where `j <= i`), if the element at index `j` is less than the element at index `k`, add the element at index `k` to the sum of the subsequence ending at `j`.

4. **Find the Maximum**: The result will be the maximum sum obtained by including the element at index `k` in any of the valid subsequences.

### Pseudocode

```
function max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):
    initialize max_sum array of size i+1 with zeros

    for j from 0 to i:
        set max_sum[j] to arr[j]
        for m from 0 to j-1:
            if arr[m] < arr[j]:
                max_sum[j] = max(max_sum[j], max_sum[m] + arr[j])

    result = 0
    for j from 0 to i:
        if arr[j] < arr[k]:
            result = max(result, max_sum[j] + arr[k])

    return result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):
    # Initialize an array to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences
    # ending at each index up to i
    max_sum = [0] * (i + 1)
    
    # Calculate the maximum sum of increasing subsequences for each index up to i
    for j in range(i + 1):
        max_sum[j] = arr[j]
        for m in range(j):
            if arr[m] < arr[j]:
                max_sum[j] = max(max_sum[j], max_sum[m] + arr[j])
    
    # Find the maximum sum of subsequences that can be extended to include arr[k]
    result = 0
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[j] < arr[k]:
            result = max(result, max_sum[j] + arr[k])
    
    return result
```

This solution calculates the maximum sum of increasing subsequences up to index `i` and checks if they can be extended to include the element at index `k`. The result is the maximum sum of such subsequences.
