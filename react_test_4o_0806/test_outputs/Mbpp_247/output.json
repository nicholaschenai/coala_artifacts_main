    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a given string. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to build a table where each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring from index `i` to `j` of the given string. \n\n1. If the characters at the start and end of the substring are the same, then the length of the longest palindromic subsequence is 2 plus the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of the substring without these two characters.\n2. If the characters at the start and end are different, then the length of the longest palindromic subsequence is the maximum of the lengths of the longest palindromic subsequences of the substrings obtained by removing either the start or the end character.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `n x n` where `n` is the length of the string, and set all values to 0.\n2. For each character in the string, set `dp[i][i] = 1` because a single character is a palindrome of length 1.\n3. Iterate over the length of the substring from 2 to `n`.\n   - For each length, iterate over the start index `i` from 0 to `n - length`.\n     - Calculate the end index `j = i + length - 1`.\n     - If the characters at `i` and `j` are the same, set `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2`.\n     - Otherwise, set `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.\n4. The result is stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, which represents the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef lps(s: str) -> int:\n    n = len(s)\n    # Create a 2D array to store the length of longest palindromic subsequence\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Every single character is a palindrome of length 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = 1\n    \n    # Build the dp table\n    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            j = i + length - 1\n            if s[i] == s[j]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    \n    # The result is in the top right corner of the table\n    return dp[0][n - 1]\n```\n\nThis code uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the given string. The time complexity is O(n^2) and the space complexity is also O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string.",
