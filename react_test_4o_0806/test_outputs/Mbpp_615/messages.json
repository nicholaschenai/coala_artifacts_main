The function should calculate the average of the numbers in each inner tuple and return these averages as a list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate over each inner tuple in the main tuple.\n   - For each inner tuple, we will calculate the sum of its elements and divide by the number of elements to get the average.\n   - We will store each calculated average in a list.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of averages.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function average_tuple with parameter tuples_of_tuples\n       Initialize an empty list called averages\n       For each inner_tuple in tuples_of_tuples\n           Calculate the sum of elements in inner_tuple\n           Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of inner_tuple\n           Append the average to the averages list\n       Return the averages list\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef average_tuple(tuples_of_tuples):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the averages\n    averages = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the input tuple of tuples\n    for inner_tuple in tuples_of_tuples:\n        # Calculate the sum of the elements in the current tuple\n        total = sum(inner_tuple)\n        # Calculate the average by dividing the total by the number of elements\n        average = total / len(inner_tuple)\n        # Append the calculated average to the averages list\n        averages.append(average)\n    \n    # Return the list of averages\n    return averages\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `average_tuple` which calculates the average of each inner tuple and returns a list of these averages."
