You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/256 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the count of prime numbers that are less than this input number.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - To find the number of prime numbers less than a given number `n`, we can iterate through all numbers from 2 to `n-1` and check if each number is prime.
   - To check if a number `k` is prime, we can test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `k`. If `k` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.
   - Count each prime number found and return the total count.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function is_prime(number):
       If number is less than 2, return False
       For each integer i from 2 to the square root of number:
           If number is divisible by i, return False
       Return True

   Define function count_Primes_nums(n):
       Initialize prime_count to 0
       For each integer num from 2 to n-1:
           If is_prime(num) is True:
               Increment prime_count by 1
       Return prime_count
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_prime(number: int) -> bool:
    # A number less than 2 is not prime
    if number < 2:
        return False
    # Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number
    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_Primes_nums(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the count of prime numbers
    prime_count = 0
    # Iterate over each number from 2 to n-1
    for num in range(2, n):
        # Check if the current number is prime
        if is_prime(num):
            # Increment the prime count if it is prime
            prime_count += 1
    # Return the total count of prime numbers found
    return prime_count
```

This solution defines a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime and uses it within the main function `count_Primes_nums` to count all prime numbers less than the given input `n`.
