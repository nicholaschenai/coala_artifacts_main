    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the count of prime numbers that are less than this input number.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n   - To find the number of prime numbers less than a given number `n`, we can iterate through all numbers from 2 to `n-1` and check if each number is prime.\n   - To check if a number `k` is prime, we can test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `k`. If `k` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n   - Count each prime number found and return the total count.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function is_prime(number):\n       If number is less than 2, return False\n       For each integer i from 2 to the square root of number:\n           If number is divisible by i, return False\n       Return True\n\n   Define function count_Primes_nums(n):\n       Initialize prime_count to 0\n       For each integer num from 2 to n-1:\n           If is_prime(num) is True:\n               Increment prime_count by 1\n       Return prime_count\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(number: int) -> bool:\n    # A number less than 2 is not prime\n    if number < 2:\n        return False\n    # Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number\n    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):\n        if number % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef count_Primes_nums(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the count of prime numbers\n    prime_count = 0\n    # Iterate over each number from 2 to n-1\n    for num in range(2, n):\n        # Check if the current number is prime\n        if is_prime(num):\n            # Increment the prime count if it is prime\n            prime_count += 1\n    # Return the total count of prime numbers found\n    return prime_count\n```\n\nThis solution defines a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime and uses it within the main function `count_Primes_nums` to count all prime numbers less than the given input `n`.",
