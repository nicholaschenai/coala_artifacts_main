The function should replace the last element of the first list with all the elements of the second list, and then return the modified first list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, we need to remove the last element from the first list.\n   - Then, we append all elements of the second list to the modified first list.\n   - Finally, we return the updated first list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `replace_list` that takes two parameters: `list1` and `list2`.\n   - Remove the last element from `list1`.\n   - Extend `list1` with `list2`.\n   - Return the modified `list1`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef replace_list(list1: list, list2: list) -> list:\n    # Remove the last element from list1\n    list1.pop()\n    \n    # Extend list1 with all elements from list2\n    list1.extend(list2)\n    \n    # Return the modified list1\n    return list1\n```\n\nThis function will take two lists, remove the last element from the first list, append all elements from the second list to the first list, and return the modified first list."
