You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/240 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two lists as input. The function should replace the last element of the first list with all the elements of the second list, and then return the modified first list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, we need to remove the last element from the first list.
   - Then, we append all elements of the second list to the modified first list.
   - Finally, we return the updated first list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `replace_list` that takes two parameters: `list1` and `list2`.
   - Remove the last element from `list1`.
   - Extend `list1` with `list2`.
   - Return the modified `list1`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def replace_list(list1: list, list2: list) -> list:
    # Remove the last element from list1
    list1.pop()
    
    # Extend list1 with all elements from list2
    list1.extend(list2)
    
    # Return the modified list1
    return list1
```

This function will take two lists, remove the last element from the first list, append all elements from the second list to the first list, and return the modified first list.

def replace_list(list1: list, list2: list) -> list:

    list1.extend(list2)
    
    # Return the modified list1
