    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of lists (nested lists) as input and returns the common elements that appear in all of these lists. The function should return these common elements as a list.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find elements that are present in every list within a list of lists.\n2. **Approach**:\n   - Start with the first list and assume all its elements are common.\n   - For each subsequent list, update the set of common elements by keeping only those elements that are also present in the current list.\n   - By the end of the iteration through all lists, the remaining elements in the set will be those that are common to all lists.\n3. **Output**: Return the common elements as a list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a set with the elements of the first list.\n2. For each subsequent list:\n   - Update the set of common elements by intersecting it with the current list.\n3. Convert the set of common elements to a list and return it.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n    # Start with the first list's elements as a set\n    common_elements = set(nested_lists[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over the remaining lists\n    for lst in nested_lists[1:]:\n        # Update the common elements by intersecting with the current list\n        common_elements.intersection_update(lst)\n    \n    # Return the common elements as a list\n    return list(common_elements)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the common elements by leveraging set operations, which are generally faster for membership tests and intersections compared to list operations. The use of `intersection_update` ensures that we only keep elements that are present in all lists.",
