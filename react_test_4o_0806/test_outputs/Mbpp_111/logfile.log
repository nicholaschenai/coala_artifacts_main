You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/111 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of lists (nested lists) as input and returns the common elements that appear in all of these lists. The function should return these common elements as a list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find elements that are present in every list within a list of lists.
2. **Approach**:
   - Start with the first list and assume all its elements are common.
   - For each subsequent list, update the set of common elements by keeping only those elements that are also present in the current list.
   - By the end of the iteration through all lists, the remaining elements in the set will be those that are common to all lists.
3. **Output**: Return the common elements as a list.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a set with the elements of the first list.
2. For each subsequent list:
   - Update the set of common elements by intersecting it with the current list.
3. Convert the set of common elements to a list and return it.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
    # Start with the first list's elements as a set
    common_elements = set(nested_lists[0])
    
    # Iterate over the remaining lists
    for lst in nested_lists[1:]:
        # Update the common elements by intersecting with the current list
        common_elements.intersection_update(lst)
    
    # Return the common elements as a list
    return list(common_elements)
```

This solution efficiently finds the common elements by leveraging set operations, which are generally faster for membership tests and intersections compared to list operations. The use of `intersection_update` ensures that we only keep elements that are present in all lists.
