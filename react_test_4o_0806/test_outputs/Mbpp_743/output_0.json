    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a list and an integer as inputs. The function should rotate the list to the right by the number of positions specified by the integer. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and the integer is `3`, the output should be `[8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Determine the length of the list.\n2. Calculate the effective number of rotations needed. This is because rotating a list by its length results in the same list, so we only need to rotate by the remainder when the number of rotations is divided by the list length.\n3. Slice the list into two parts: the last `k` elements and the rest of the list.\n4. Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to achieve the rotation.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define the function `rotate_right` with parameters `lst` and `k`.\n2. Calculate the length of the list `n`.\n3. Compute the effective rotations needed: `k = k % n`.\n4. Slice the list into two parts: `lst[-k:]` and `lst[:-k]`.\n5. Concatenate these two slices: `lst[-k:] + lst[:-k]`.\n6. Return the concatenated list.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef rotate_right(lst: list, k: int) -> list:\n    # Calculate the length of the list\n    n = len(lst)\n    \n    # Calculate the effective number of rotations needed\n    k = k % n\n    \n    # Slice the list into two parts and concatenate them in reverse order\n    return lst[-k:] + lst[:-k]\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently rotates the list by slicing and concatenating, ensuring that the operation is performed in linear time relative to the size of the list.",
