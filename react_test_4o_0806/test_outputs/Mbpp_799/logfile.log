INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/799 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a 32-bit integer and rotates its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. The function should return the resulting integer after the rotation.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand Bit Rotation**: Rotating bits to the left by `d` positions means that each bit in the number is shifted `d` positions to the left. The bits that overflow on the left are wrapped around to the right end of the number.

2. **32-bit Constraint**: Since the number is 32-bit, we need to ensure that the rotation respects this bit width. This means that after shifting, any bits that go beyond the 32nd position should wrap around to the beginning.

3. **Steps to Rotate**:
   - Shift the number to the left by `d` positions.
   - Capture the bits that overflow beyond the 32nd bit.
   - Shift these overflow bits to the right end of the number.
   - Combine the two results using a bitwise OR operation.

4. **Modulo Operation**: Since rotating by 32 or more positions results in the same number, we can use `d % 32` to simplify the rotation.

### Pseudocode

1. Calculate `d = d % 32` to handle cases where `d` is 32 or more.
2. Perform a left shift on the number by `d` positions.
3. Capture the overflow bits by right shifting the number by `(32 - d)` positions.
4. Combine the results using a bitwise OR to get the final rotated number.
5. Return the result.

### Python Code

```python
def left_rotate(n: int, d: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Normalize d to be within 0 to 31
    d = d % 32
    
    # Step 2: Perform the left rotation
    # Left shift the number by d positions
    left_shifted = n << d
    
    # Step 3: Capture the overflow bits
    # Right shift the number by (32 - d) positions
    overflow_bits = n >> (32 - d)
    
    # Step 4: Combine the left shifted and overflow bits using bitwise OR
    result = (left_shifted | overflow_bits) & 0xFFFFFFFF
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return result
```

This code will correctly rotate the bits of a 32-bit integer to the left by `d` positions, wrapping any overflow bits around to the right end. The use of `0xFFFFFFFF` ensures that the result is constrained to 32 bits.
