        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nThe task is to write a function that calculates the Eulerian number \\( a(n, m) \\). Eulerian numbers are a sequence of numbers that count the permutations of a set of numbers with a given number of ascents. An ascent in a permutation is a position where the next number is greater than the current number.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nEulerian numbers can be defined recursively. The recursive formula for Eulerian numbers is:\n\n\\[ a(n, m) = (n - m) \\cdot a(n-1, m-1) + (m + 1) \\cdot a(n-1, m) \\]\n\nwith the base cases:\n- \\( a(0, 0) = 1 \\)\n- \\( a(n, 0) = 1 \\) for \\( n > 0 \\)\n- \\( a(n, m) = 0 \\) for \\( m \\geq n \\)\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a helper function `eulerian_helper(n, m, memo)` that:\n   - Checks if the result is already in `memo`. If so, return it.\n   - If \\( m \\geq n \\), return 0.\n   - If \\( m = 0 \\), return 1.\n   - Otherwise, calculate the value using the recursive formula:\n     - \\( a(n, m) = (n - m) \\cdot a(n-1, m-1) + (m + 1) \\cdot a(n-1, m) \\)\n   - Store the result in `memo` and return it.\n\n2. Define the main function `eulerian_num(n, m)` that:\n   - Initializes an empty dictionary `memo`.\n   - Calls `eulerian_helper(n, m, memo)` and returns the result.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef eulerian_helper(n, m, memo):\n    # Check if the result is already computed\n    if (n, m) in memo:\n        return memo[(n, m)]\n    \n    # Base cases\n    if m >= n:\n        return 0\n    if m == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Recursive calculation using the Eulerian number formula\n    result = (n - m) * eulerian_helper(n - 1, m - 1, memo) + (m + 1) * eulerian_helper(n - 1, m, memo)\n    \n    # Store the result in memoization dictionary\n    memo[(n, m)] = result\n    return result\n\ndef eulerian_num(n: int, m: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize memoization dictionary\n    memo = {}\n    # Calculate the Eulerian number using the helper function\n    return eulerian_helper(n, m, memo)\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently compute the Eulerian numbers. The memoization dictionary `memo` stores previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations, ensuring that the function runs efficiently even for larger values of \\( n \\) and \\( m \\)."
