You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/733 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified number in a sorted list of numbers. The list is sorted in non-decreasing order, and we need to return the index of the first time the specified number appears in the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Since the list is sorted, we can take advantage of this property to efficiently find the first occurrence of the number.
   - We can iterate through the list from the beginning and check each element.
   - As soon as we find the number, we return its index.
   - If we reach the end of the list without finding the number, it means the number is not present, and we can return a special value like `-1` to indicate this.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_first_occurrence(arr, target):
       for index from 0 to length of arr - 1:
           if arr[index] is equal to target:
               return index
       return -1
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_first_occurrence(arr, target):
    # Iterate over each element in the array
    for index in range(len(arr)):
        # Check if the current element is equal to the target
        if arr[index] == target:
            # If found, return the current index
            return index
    # If the loop completes without finding the target, return -1
    return -1
```

This solution efficiently finds the first occurrence of the target number in a sorted list by leveraging a simple linear search, which is optimal given the sorted nature of the list.
