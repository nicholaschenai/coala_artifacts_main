    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string containing only the characters that are at even indices in the original string. In other words, we need to remove characters that are at odd indices.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - To solve this problem, we can iterate over the string and collect characters that are located at even indices. We can achieve this by using a loop that increments by 2, starting from index 0. This way, we only access even-indexed characters and append them to a new string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Initialize an empty string to store the result.\n   - Loop through the input string using an index that starts at 0 and increments by 2.\n   - For each index, append the character at that index to the result string.\n   - After the loop, return the result string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_odd(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through the string with a step of 2 to get even indices\n    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):\n        # Append the character at the current even index to the result\n        result += s[i]\n    \n    # Return the result string containing only characters at even indices\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly remove characters at odd indices and return a string with only the characters at even indices, as required by the problem statement.",
