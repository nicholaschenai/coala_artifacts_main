    "raw_msg": "Upon reviewing the problem and the initial solution, it appears that the initial solution is indeed correct. The function `remove_odd` is designed to collect characters at even indices, which aligns with the requirement to remove characters at odd indices. Therefore, the function should return \"pto\" for the input \"python\", as it collects characters at indices 0, 2, and 4.\n\nHere is the correct solution:\n\n```python\ndef remove_odd(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through the string with a step of 2 to get even indices\n    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):\n        # Append the character at the current even index to the result\n        result += s[i]\n    \n    # Return the result string containing only characters at even indices\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function correctly implements the logic to remove characters at odd indices by collecting characters at even indices.",
