    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that finds all numbers within a specified range (from `startnum` to `endnum`) where each number is divisible by every digit it contains. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 1 and 2, so it should be included in the result.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Iterate through each number in the range from `startnum` to `endnum`.\n2. For each number, check if it is divisible by each of its digits.\n3. If a number is divisible by all of its digits, add it to the result list.\n4. Return the list of numbers that meet the criteria.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):\n    initialize an empty list called result\n    for each number in the range from startnum to endnum (inclusive):\n        convert the number to a string to iterate over its digits\n        set a flag divisible to True\n        for each digit in the string representation of the number:\n            convert the digit back to an integer\n            if the digit is 0 or the number is not divisible by the digit:\n                set divisible to False\n                break the loop\n        if divisible is True:\n            append the number to the result list\n    return the result list\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef divisible_by_digits(startnum: int, endnum: int) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the specified range\n    for num in range(startnum, endnum + 1):\n        # Convert the number to a string to access each digit\n        num_str = str(num)\n        # Assume the number is divisible by all its digits\n        divisible = True\n        \n        # Check each digit\n        for digit_char in num_str:\n            digit = int(digit_char)\n            # If the digit is 0 or the number is not divisible by the digit\n            if digit == 0 or num % digit != 0:\n                divisible = False\n                break\n        \n        # If the number is divisible by all its digits, add it to the result\n        if divisible:\n            result.append(num)\n    \n    # Return the list of numbers that are divisible by all their digits\n    return result\n```",
