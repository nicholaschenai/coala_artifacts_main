INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/745 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that finds all numbers within a specified range (from `startnum` to `endnum`) where each number is divisible by every digit it contains. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 1 and 2, so it should be included in the result.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate through each number in the range from `startnum` to `endnum`.
2. For each number, check if it is divisible by each of its digits.
3. If a number is divisible by all of its digits, add it to the result list.
4. Return the list of numbers that meet the criteria.

## Pseudocode

```
function divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    initialize an empty list called result
    for each number in the range from startnum to endnum (inclusive):
        convert the number to a string to iterate over its digits
        set a flag divisible to True
        for each digit in the string representation of the number:
            convert the digit back to an integer
            if the digit is 0 or the number is not divisible by the digit:
                set divisible to False
                break the loop
        if divisible is True:
            append the number to the result list
    return the result list
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def divisible_by_digits(startnum: int, endnum: int) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the specified range
    for num in range(startnum, endnum + 1):
        # Convert the number to a string to access each digit
        num_str = str(num)
        # Assume the number is divisible by all its digits
        divisible = True
        
        # Check each digit
        for digit_char in num_str:
            digit = int(digit_char)
