    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. The function should return a list of tuples where every element in each tuple is divisible by `k`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, we will check if all of its elements are divisible by `k`.\n   - If a tuple meets this condition, we will include it in the result list.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of tuples that satisfy the condition.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function find_tuples with parameters: list_of_tuples, k\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each tuple in list_of_tuples\n           Check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by k\n           If true, append the tuple to result\n       Return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_tuples(list_of_tuples, k):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list\n    for tup in list_of_tuples:\n        # Check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by k\n        if all(element % k == 0 for element in tup):\n            # If true, append the tuple to the result list\n            result.append(tup)\n    \n    # Return the list of tuples that satisfy the condition\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `find_tuples` which iterates over each tuple in the input list, checks if all elements in the tuple are divisible by `k`, and collects those tuples in a result list which is returned at the end.",
