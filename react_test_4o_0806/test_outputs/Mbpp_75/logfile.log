You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/75 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. The function should return a list of tuples where every element in each tuple is divisible by `k`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, we will check if all of its elements are divisible by `k`.
   - If a tuple meets this condition, we will include it in the result list.
   - Finally, we will return the list of tuples that satisfy the condition.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function find_tuples with parameters: list_of_tuples, k
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each tuple in list_of_tuples
           Check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by k
           If true, append the tuple to result
       Return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_tuples(list_of_tuples, k):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list
    for tup in list_of_tuples:
        # Check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by k
        if all(element % k == 0 for element in tup):
            # If true, append the tuple to the result list
            result.append(tup)
    
    # Return the list of tuples that satisfy the condition
    return result
```

This code defines the function `find_tuples` which iterates over each tuple in the input list, checks if all elements in the tuple are divisible by `k`, and collects those tuples in a result list which is returned at the end.

            result.append(tup)
    
    # Return the list of tuples that satisfy the condition
    return result
