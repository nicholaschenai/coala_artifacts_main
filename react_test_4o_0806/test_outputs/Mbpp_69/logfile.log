You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/69 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if a given list (sublist) is contained within another list (main list) as a contiguous sequence. The function should return `True` if the sublist is found in the main list, and `False` otherwise.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We need to iterate over the main list and check if the sublist appears as a contiguous sequence.
2. For each position in the main list, we will check if the elements starting from that position match the elements of the sublist.
3. If we find a match, we return `True`.
4. If we finish checking all possible starting positions in the main list without finding a match, we return `False`.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `is_sublist(main_list, sublist)`.
2. Get the lengths of `main_list` and `sublist`.
3. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `main_list`, return `False` immediately.
4. Iterate over `main_list` from index 0 to `len(main_list) - len(sublist) + 1`:
   - For each starting index, check if the slice of `main_list` from the current index to the current index plus the length of `sublist` matches `sublist`.
   - If a match is found, return `True`.
5. If no match is found after the loop, return `False`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_sublist(main_list: list, sublist: list) -> bool:
    # Get the lengths of the main list and the sublist
    len_main = len(main_list)
    len_sub = len(sublist)
    
    # If the sublist is longer than the main list, it cannot be a sublist
    if len_sub > len_main:
        return False
    
    # Iterate over possible starting indices in the main list
    for i in range(len_main - len_sub + 1):
        # Check if the slice of main_list matches the sublist
        if main_list[i:i+len_sub] == sublist:
            return True
    
    # If no match is found, return False
    return False
```

This solution efficiently checks for the presence of the sublist within the main list by leveraging Python's list slicing and comparison capabilities.
