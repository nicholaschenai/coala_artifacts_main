        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that checks if a given list (sublist) is contained within another list (main list) as a contiguous sequence. The function should return `True` if the sublist is found in the main list, and `False` otherwise.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We need to iterate over the main list and check if the sublist appears as a contiguous sequence.\n2. For each position in the main list, we will check if the elements starting from that position match the elements of the sublist.\n3. If we find a match, we return `True`.\n4. If we finish checking all possible starting positions in the main list without finding a match, we return `False`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `is_sublist(main_list, sublist)`.\n2. Get the lengths of `main_list` and `sublist`.\n3. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `main_list`, return `False` immediately.\n4. Iterate over `main_list` from index 0 to `len(main_list) - len(sublist) + 1`:\n   - For each starting index, check if the slice of `main_list` from the current index to the current index plus the length of `sublist` matches `sublist`.\n   - If a match is found, return `True`.\n5. If no match is found after the loop, return `False`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_sublist(main_list: list, sublist: list) -> bool:\n    # Get the lengths of the main list and the sublist\n    len_main = len(main_list)\n    len_sub = len(sublist)\n    \n    # If the sublist is longer than the main list, it cannot be a sublist\n    if len_sub > len_main:\n        return False\n    \n    # Iterate over possible starting indices in the main list\n    for i in range(len_main - len_sub + 1):\n        # Check if the slice of main_list matches the sublist\n        if main_list[i:i+len_sub] == sublist:\n            return True\n    \n    # If no match is found, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently checks for the presence of the sublist within the main list by leveraging Python's list slicing and comparison capabilities."
