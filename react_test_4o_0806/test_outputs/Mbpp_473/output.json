    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes two lists of tuples and finds the intersection of these tuples, considering the tuples as sets of elements. This means that the order of elements in the tuples does not matter. The function should return a set of tuples that are present in both lists, regardless of the order of elements within the tuples.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Convert each tuple in both lists into a set of elements. This allows us to ignore the order of elements within the tuples.\n2. Create a set of these sets for each list.\n3. Find the intersection of these two sets of sets.\n4. Convert the resulting set of sets back into a set of tuples, ensuring that the tuples are in a consistent order (e.g., sorted order).\n5. Return the set of tuples.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize an empty set `set1`.\n2. For each tuple `t` in the first list:\n   - Convert `t` to a set and add it to `set1`.\n3. Initialize an empty set `set2`.\n4. For each tuple `t` in the second list:\n   - Convert `t` to a set and add it to `set2`.\n5. Find the intersection of `set1` and `set2`.\n6. Convert each set in the intersection back to a tuple, ensuring the elements are sorted.\n7. Return the set of these tuples.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef tuple_intersection(list1, list2):\n    # Convert each tuple in list1 to a set and store in set1\n    set1 = {frozenset(t) for t in list1}\n    \n    # Convert each tuple in list2 to a set and store in set2\n    set2 = {frozenset(t) for t in list2}\n    \n    # Find the intersection of set1 and set2\n    intersection = set1.intersection(set2)\n    \n    # Convert each frozenset in the intersection back to a sorted tuple\n    result = {tuple(sorted(s)) for s in intersection}\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution uses `frozenset` to handle the unordered nature of the tuples and ensures that the intersection is computed correctly. The final conversion to tuples with sorted elements ensures that the output is consistent and matches the expected format.",
