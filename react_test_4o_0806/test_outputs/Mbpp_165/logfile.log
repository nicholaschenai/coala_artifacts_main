Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/165 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that counts how many characters in a given string are in the same position as they are in the English alphabet. The comparison should be case insensitive. For example, the letter 'a' is the 1st letter in the alphabet, so it should be in the 1st position of the string (index 0) to be counted.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case insensitive.
2. Iterate over each character in the string along with its index.
3. For each character, determine its position in the alphabet. This can be done by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the character and adding 1.
4. Compare the character's position in the alphabet with its position in the string (index + 1).
5. Count how many characters satisfy the condition where their position in the string matches their position in the alphabet.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_char_position(s):
    convert s to lowercase
    initialize count to 0
    for each character c and its index i in s:
        calculate alphabet_position as (ASCII value of c - ASCII value of 'a' + 1)
        if alphabet_position equals (i + 1):
            increment count
    return count
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def count_char_position(s: str) -> int:
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity
    s = s.lower()
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character and its index
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        # Calculate the position of the character in the alphabet
        alphabet_position = ord(c) - ord('a') + 1
        
        # Check if the alphabet position matches the string position (index + 1)
        if alphabet_position == i + 1:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

This solution iterates over the string, calculates the alphabet position for each character, and checks if it matches the character's position in the string. The count of such matches is returned.
