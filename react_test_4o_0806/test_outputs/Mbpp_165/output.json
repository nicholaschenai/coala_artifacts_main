    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that counts how many characters in a given string are in the same position as they are in the English alphabet. The comparison should be case insensitive. For example, the letter 'a' is the 1st letter in the alphabet, so it should be in the 1st position of the string (index 0) to be counted.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Convert the input string to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case insensitive.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string along with its index.\n3. For each character, determine its position in the alphabet. This can be done by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the character and adding 1.\n4. Compare the character's position in the alphabet with its position in the string (index + 1).\n5. Count how many characters satisfy the condition where their position in the string matches their position in the alphabet.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_char_position(s):\n    convert s to lowercase\n    initialize count to 0\n    for each character c and its index i in s:\n        calculate alphabet_position as (ASCII value of c - ASCII value of 'a' + 1)\n        if alphabet_position equals (i + 1):\n            increment count\n    return count\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_char_position(s: str) -> int:\n    # Convert the string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity\n    s = s.lower()\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character and its index\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        # Calculate the position of the character in the alphabet\n        alphabet_position = ord(c) - ord('a') + 1\n        \n        # Check if the alphabet position matches the string position (index + 1)\n        if alphabet_position == i + 1:\n            count += 1\n    \n    return count\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over the string, calculates the alphabet position for each character, and checks if it matches the character's position in the string. The count of such matches is returned.",
