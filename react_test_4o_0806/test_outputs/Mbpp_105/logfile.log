You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that takes a list of boolean values and returns the count of `True` values in that list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a counter to zero.
2. Iterate through each element in the list.
3. For each element, check if it is `True`.
4. If it is `True`, increment the counter by one.
5. After iterating through the list, return the counter value, which represents the number of `True` values in the list.

## Pseudocode

```
function count(boolean_list):
    initialize counter to 0
    for each element in boolean_list:
        if element is True:
            increment counter by 1
    return counter
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count(boolean_list):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of True values
    true_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each element in the list
    for element in boolean_list:
        # Check if the element is True
        if element is True:
            # Increment the counter if the element is True
            true_count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of True values
    return true_count
```

        # Check if the element is True
