Initialize a counter to zero.\n2. Iterate through each element in the list.\n3. For each element, check if it is `True`.\n4. If it is `True`, increment the counter by one.\n5. After iterating through the list, return the counter value, which represents the number of `True` values in the list.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count(boolean_list):\n    initialize counter to 0\n    for each element in boolean_list:\n        if element is True:\n            increment counter by 1\n    return counter\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count(boolean_list):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of True values\n    true_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the list\n    for element in boolean_list:\n        # Check if the element is True\n        if element is True:\n            # Increment the counter if the element is True\n            true_count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of True values\n    return true_count\n```"
