You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/573 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the product of all unique numbers in that list. The function should return this product.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Unique Numbers**: First, we need to identify the unique numbers in the list. This can be done by converting the list to a set, which automatically removes duplicates.
2. **Calculate the Product**: Once we have the unique numbers, we need to calculate their product. We can initialize a variable to 1 (since 1 is the multiplicative identity) and multiply each unique number to this variable.
3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the product as the result.

## Pseudocode

1. Convert the list to a set to get unique numbers.
2. Initialize a variable `product` to 1.
3. For each number in the set of unique numbers:
   - Multiply `product` by the number.
4. Return `product`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def unique_product(numbers):
    # Step 1: Convert the list to a set to get unique numbers
    unique_numbers = set(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the product variable
    product = 1
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the product of unique numbers
    for number in unique_numbers:
        product *= number
    
    # Step 4: Return the product
    return product
