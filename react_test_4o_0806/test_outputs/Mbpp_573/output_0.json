    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and calculates the product of all unique numbers in that list. The function should return this product.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Unique Numbers**: First, we need to identify the unique numbers in the list. This can be done by converting the list to a set, which automatically removes duplicates.\n2. **Calculate the Product**: Once we have the unique numbers, we need to calculate their product. We can initialize a variable to 1 (since 1 is the multiplicative identity) and multiply each unique number to this variable.\n3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the product as the result.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Convert the list to a set to get unique numbers.\n2. Initialize a variable `product` to 1.\n3. For each number in the set of unique numbers:\n   - Multiply `product` by the number.\n4. Return `product`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef unique_product(numbers):\n    # Step 1: Convert the list to a set to get unique numbers\n    unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n    \n    # Step 2: Initialize the product variable\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the product of unique numbers\n    for number in unique_numbers:\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the product\n    return product\n```",
