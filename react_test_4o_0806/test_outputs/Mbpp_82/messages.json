The function should return a floating-point number that represents the volume.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   The formula to calculate the volume of a sphere is \\((4/3) \\times \\pi \\times r^3\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the sphere. We will implement a function that takes the radius as input, applies this formula, and returns the calculated volume. We will use Python's built-in constant `math.pi` for the value of \\(\\pi\\).\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   - Import the `math` module to access the value of \\(\\pi\\).\n   - Define a function `volume_sphere` that takes one parameter `radius`.\n   - Inside the function, calculate the volume using the formula \\((4/3) \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius}^3\\).\n   - Return the calculated volume.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_sphere(radius: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula (4/3) * pi * radius^3\n    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `volume_sphere` that calculates and returns the volume of a sphere given its radius, using the mathematical formula for the volume of a sphere."
