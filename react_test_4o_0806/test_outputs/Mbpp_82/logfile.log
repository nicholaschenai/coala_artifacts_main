You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/82 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius. The function should return a floating-point number that represents the volume.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   The formula to calculate the volume of a sphere is \((4/3) \times \pi \times r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. We will implement a function that takes the radius as input, applies this formula, and returns the calculated volume. We will use Python's built-in constant `math.pi` for the value of \(\pi\).

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   - Import the `math` module to access the value of \(\pi\).
   - Define a function `volume_sphere` that takes one parameter `radius`.
   - Inside the function, calculate the volume using the formula \((4/3) \times \pi \times \text{radius}^3\).
   - Return the calculated volume.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
import math

def volume_sphere(radius: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula (4/3) * pi * radius^3
    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
```

This code defines a function `volume_sphere` that calculates and returns the volume of a sphere given its radius, using the mathematical formula for the volume of a sphere.

def volume_sphere(radius: float) -> float:

    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
