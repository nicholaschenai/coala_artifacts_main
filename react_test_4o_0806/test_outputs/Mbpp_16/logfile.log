You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/16 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string consists of sequences of lowercase letters separated by underscores. If the string matches this pattern, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each character in the string.
   - We will check if the string contains only lowercase letters and underscores.
   - We will ensure that underscores are not at the start or end of the string and that they are not consecutive.
   - If all these conditions are met, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function text_lowercase_underscore(s):
       If the string is empty, return False
       If the first or last character is an underscore, return False
       Initialize a variable to track if the previous character was an underscore
       For each character in the string:
           If the character is not a lowercase letter and not an underscore, return False
           If the character is an underscore:
               If the previous character was also an underscore, return False
               Set the previous character as underscore
           Else:
               Set the previous character as not underscore
       Return True
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def text_lowercase_underscore(s: str) -> bool:
