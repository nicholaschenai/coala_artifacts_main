    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that finds all the \"ludic numbers\" that are less than or equal to a given integer `n`. A ludic number is a number that remains after repeatedly removing every k-th number from a list of natural numbers starting from 1, where k is the smallest number in the list that hasn't been removed yet.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start with a list of numbers from 1 to `n`.\n   - Begin with the first number in the list (which is 1) and consider it as a ludic number.\n   - Remove every 1st number from the list, which effectively does nothing since 1 is the first number.\n   - Move to the next number in the list that hasn't been removed (which is 2) and consider it as a ludic number.\n   - Remove every 2nd number from the list.\n   - Continue this process: for each new smallest number in the list that hasn't been removed, consider it a ludic number and remove every k-th number from the list.\n   - Stop when the smallest number in the list is greater than the remaining numbers.\n   - The remaining numbers in the list are the ludic numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function get_ludic(n):\n       create a list `numbers` containing numbers from 1 to n\n       create an empty list `ludic_numbers`\n       \n       while `numbers` is not empty:\n           take the first number `k` from `numbers` and add it to `ludic_numbers`\n           remove every k-th number from `numbers` starting from the k-th position\n       \n       return `ludic_numbers`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n: int) -> list:\n    # Create a list of numbers from 1 to n\n    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))\n    # This will store the ludic numbers\n    ludic_numbers = []\n    \n    # Continue the process until there are no more numbers to process\n    while numbers:\n        # The first number in the list is always a ludic number\n        k = numbers[0]\n        ludic_numbers.append(k)\n        \n        # Remove every k-th number from the list\n        # Start from the k-th position and step by k\n        numbers = [num for i, num in enumerate(numbers) if (i + 1) % k != 0]\n    \n    return ludic_numbers\n```\n\nThis code implements the process of finding ludic numbers by iteratively removing every k-th number from a list of numbers, where k is the smallest number in the list that hasn't been removed yet. The remaining numbers are the ludic numbers.",
