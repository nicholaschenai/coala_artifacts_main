The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/630 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a coordinate tuple (x, y) as input and returns a list of lists containing all the adjacent coordinates, including the coordinate itself. The adjacent coordinates are those that differ by at most 1 in either the x or y direction.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Given a coordinate (x, y), we need to find all coordinates that are adjacent to it. This includes the coordinate itself.
2. The adjacent coordinates can be found by varying x and y by -1, 0, or +1.
3. This results in a 3x3 grid centered around the given coordinate (x, y).
4. We will iterate over the possible values of x and y, which are x-1, x, x+1 and y-1, y, y+1, respectively.
5. For each combination of these x and y values, we will create a list [new_x, new_y] and add it to the result list.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty list `adjacent_coordinates`.
2. For each `dx` in [-1, 0, 1]:
   - For each `dy` in [-1, 0, 1]:
     - Calculate `new_x` as `x + dx`.
     - Calculate `new_y` as `y + dy`.
     - Append the list `[new_x, new_y]` to `adjacent_coordinates`.
3. Return `adjacent_coordinates`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def get_coordinates(coord: tuple) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store adjacent coordinates
    adjacent_coordinates = []
    
    # Extract x and y from the input coordinate tuple
    x, y = coord
    
    # Iterate over possible changes in x and y (-1, 0, 1)
    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
            # Calculate new coordinates
            new_x = x + dx
            new_y = y + dy
            # Append the new coordinate to the list
            adjacent_coordinates.append([new_x, new_y])
    
    # Return the list of adjacent coordinates
    return adjacent_coordinates
```

This solution iterates over all possible combinations of x and y offsets, calculates the new coordinates, and appends them to the result list. The function then returns this list, which contains all the adjacent coordinates including the original coordinate.
