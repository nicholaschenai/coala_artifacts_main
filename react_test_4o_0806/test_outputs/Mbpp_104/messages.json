The function should sort each sublist alphabetically and return the modified list of lists.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate over each sublist in the main list.\n   - For each sublist, we will sort the strings in alphabetical order.\n   - We will return the list of sorted sublists.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define a function named sort_sublists that takes a list of lists as input.\n   For each sublist in the main list:\n       Sort the sublist alphabetically.\n   Return the list of sorted sublists.\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sort_sublists(list_of_lists):\n    # Iterate over each sublist in the main list\n    for i in range(len(list_of_lists)):\n        # Sort the current sublist alphabetically\n        list_of_lists[i] = sorted(list_of_lists[i])\n    # Return the list of sorted sublists\n    return list_of_lists\n```\n\nThis function will take a list of lists as input, sort each sublist alphabetically, and return the modified list of lists."

        "content": "### Analysis of the Problem\n\n1. **Identify the issue:**\n   - The error message indicates that the input is a tuple, not a list. Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. This is why the code fails when trying to sort the sublists in place.\n\n2. **Where I went wrong:**\n   - I assumed the input would be a list of lists, but the input is actually a tuple of lists. This means we cannot modify the tuple directly. Instead, we need to create a new list of sorted sublists.\n\n### Revised Solution\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to:\n- Create a new list to store the sorted sublists.\n- Iterate over each sublist in the tuple.\n- Sort each sublist and append it to the new list.\n- Return the new list of sorted sublists.\n\n### Updated Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef sort_sublists(list_of_lists):\n    # Create a new list to store the sorted sublists\n    sorted_sublists = []\n    # Iterate over each sublist in the tuple\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Sort the current sublist alphabetically and append to the new list\n        sorted_sublists.append(sorted(sublist))\n    # Return the new list of sorted sublists\n    return sorted_sublists\n```\n\nThis revised function will handle the input as a tuple, create a new list of sorted sublists, and return it."
