INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/104 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. The function should sort each sublist alphabetically and return the modified list of lists.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each sublist in the main list.
   - For each sublist, we will sort the strings in alphabetical order.
   - We will return the list of sorted sublists.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function named sort_sublists that takes a list of lists as input.
   For each sublist in the main list:
       Sort the sublist alphabetically.
   Return the list of sorted sublists.
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    # Iterate over each sublist in the main list
    for i in range(len(list_of_lists)):
        # Sort the current sublist alphabetically
        list_of_lists[i] = sorted(list_of_lists[i])
    # Return the list of sorted sublists
    return list_of_lists
```

This function will take a list of lists as input, sort each sublist alphabetically, and return the modified list of lists.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/104 [generation text] ### Analysis of the Problem

1. **Identify the issue:**
   - The error message indicates that the input is a tuple, not a list. Tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. This is why the code fails when trying to sort the sublists in place.

2. **Where I went wrong:**
   - I assumed the input would be a list of lists, but the input is actually a tuple of lists. This means we cannot modify the tuple directly. Instead, we need to create a new list of sorted sublists.

### Revised Solution

To fix the issue, we need to:
- Create a new list to store the sorted sublists.
- Iterate over each sublist in the tuple.
- Sort each sublist and append it to the new list.
- Return the new list of sorted sublists.

### Updated Python Solution

```python
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    # Create a new list to store the sorted sublists
    sorted_sublists = []
    # Iterate over each sublist in the tuple
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Sort the current sublist alphabetically and append to the new list
        sorted_sublists.append(sorted(sublist))
    # Return the new list of sorted sublists
    return sorted_sublists
```

This revised function will handle the input as a tuple, create a new list of sorted sublists, and return it.
