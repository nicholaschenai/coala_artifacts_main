You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

[END PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/454 [prompt] 
## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/454 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z'. If the string contains 'z', the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and check if any of them is the letter 'z'. If we find 'z', we return `True`. If we finish checking all characters and don't find 'z', we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function text_match_wordz(input_string):
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is 'z':
               return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_match_wordz(input_string: str) -> bool:
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the current character is 'z'
        if char == 'z':
            # If 'z' is found, return True
            return True
    # If no 'z' is found after checking all characters, return False
    return False
```

This function will correctly identify if the input string contains the letter 'z' and return the appropriate boolean value.
