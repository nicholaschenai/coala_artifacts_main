    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to write a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the closest smaller integer than `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   - The closest smaller number to any given integer `n` is simply `n - 1`. This is because subtracting 1 from any integer gives the next smallest integer.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `closest_num` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n   - Return `n - 1`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef closest_num(n: int) -> int:\n    # Return the closest smaller number than n, which is n - 1\n    return n - 1\n```\n\nThis solution directly implements the logic that the closest smaller integer to `n` is `n - 1`.",
