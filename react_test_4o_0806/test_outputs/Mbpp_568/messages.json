An empty dictionary in Python is represented by `{}`. We can use a list comprehension to generate a list of `N` such empty dictionaries.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `empty_list` that takes an integer `N` as an argument.\n   - Use a list comprehension to create a list with `N` empty dictionaries.\n   - Return the list.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef empty_list(N: int) -> list:\n    # Create a list with N empty dictionaries using list comprehension\n    return [{} for _ in range(N)]\n```\n\nThis function will generate a list of `N` empty dictionaries by iterating `N` times and appending an empty dictionary `{}` to the list in each iteration. The use of `_` in the list comprehension indicates that the loop variable is not used in the body of the loop."
