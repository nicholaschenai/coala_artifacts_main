You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/568 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function named `empty_list` that takes an integer `N` as input and returns a list containing `N` empty dictionaries.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To solve this problem, we will create a list that contains `N` empty dictionaries. An empty dictionary in Python is represented by `{}`. We can use a list comprehension to generate a list of `N` such empty dictionaries.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `empty_list` that takes an integer `N` as an argument.
   - Use a list comprehension to create a list with `N` empty dictionaries.
   - Return the list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def empty_list(N: int) -> list:
    # Create a list with N empty dictionaries using list comprehension
    return [{} for _ in range(N)]
```

This function will generate a list of `N` empty dictionaries by iterating `N` times and appending an empty dictionary `{}` to the list in each iteration. The use of `_` in the list comprehension indicates that the loop variable is not used in the body of the loop.
