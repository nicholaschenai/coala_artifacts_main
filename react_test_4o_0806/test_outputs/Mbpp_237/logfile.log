You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/237 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a dictionary where each unique tuple (or its reverse) is a key, and the value is the number of times that tuple or its reverse appears in the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each tuple.
   - Iterate over each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, create a sorted version of the tuple to handle both the tuple and its reverse as the same key.
   - If the sorted tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count.
   - If the sorted tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.
   - After processing all tuples, return the dictionary.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function check_occurences(tuples_list):
       initialize an empty dictionary called tuple_count
       for each tuple in tuples_list:
           sort the tuple to handle both tuple and its reverse
           if sorted tuple is in tuple_count:
               increment the count of the sorted tuple
           else:
               add the sorted tuple to tuple_count with a count of 1
       return tuple_count
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_occurences(tuples_list):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each tuple
    tuple_count = {}
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for tup in tuples_list:
        # Sort the tuple to handle both the tuple and its reverse as the same key
        sorted_tup = tuple(sorted(tup))
        
        # If the sorted tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if sorted_tup in tuple_count:
            tuple_count[sorted_tup] += 1
        else:
            # If the sorted tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
            tuple_count[sorted_tup] = 1
    
    # Return the dictionary containing the counts of each tuple
    return tuple_count
```

This solution iterates through the list of tuples, normalizes each tuple by sorting it, and then counts the occurrences of each normalized tuple in a dictionary. The final dictionary is returned, which maps each unique tuple (or its reverse) to its count.

            tuple_count[sorted_tup] = 1
    
    # Return the dictionary containing the counts of each tuple
    return tuple_count
```
