You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/585 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an item with a 'name' and a 'price'. The function should also take an integer `n` and return a list of the `n` most expensive items from the input list, sorted by price in descending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, we need to sort the list of items based on their 'price' in descending order.
   - After sorting, we can simply take the first `n` items from this sorted list, as they will be the most expensive.
   - Return this list of `n` most expensive items.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function expensive_items(items, n):
       Sort the items list by 'price' in descending order
       Select the first n items from the sorted list
       Return the selected items
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def expensive_items(items, n):
    # Sort the items by 'price' in descending order
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: item['price'], reverse=True)
    # Select the first n items from the sorted list
    most_expensive_items = sorted_items[:n]
    # Return the selected items
    return most_expensive_items
```

    most_expensive_items = sorted_items[:n]
