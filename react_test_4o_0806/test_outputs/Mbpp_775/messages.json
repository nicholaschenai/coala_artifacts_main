If all elements at odd indices are odd numbers, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Iterate through the list, but only consider elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.).\n   - For each of these elements, check if it is an odd number.\n   - If any element at an odd index is not odd, return `False`.\n   - If all elements at odd indices are odd, return `True`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function odd_position(lst):\n       For each index i from 1 to length of lst, incrementing by 2:\n           If lst[i] is not odd (i.e., lst[i] % 2 == 0):\n               Return False\n       Return True\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_position(lst):\n    # Iterate over the list, considering only odd indices\n    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):\n        # Check if the element at the current odd index is not odd\n        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:\n            # If any element at an odd index is even, return False\n            return False\n    # If all elements at odd indices are odd, return True\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if every element at an odd index in the list is an odd number, as required by the problem statement."
