You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/775 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that checks if every element at an odd index in a given list is an odd number. If all elements at odd indices are odd numbers, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Iterate through the list, but only consider elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.).
   - For each of these elements, check if it is an odd number.
   - If any element at an odd index is not odd, return `False`.
   - If all elements at odd indices are odd, return `True`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function odd_position(lst):
       For each index i from 1 to length of lst, incrementing by 2:
           If lst[i] is not odd (i.e., lst[i] % 2 == 0):
               Return False
       Return True
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def odd_position(lst):
    # Iterate over the list, considering only odd indices
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        # Check if the element at the current odd index is not odd
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            # If any element at an odd index is even, return False
            return False
    # If all elements at odd indices are odd, return True
    return True
```

This function will correctly determine if every element at an odd index in the list is an odd number, as required by the problem statement.
