    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the substrings that are enclosed in double quotation marks. The function should return these substrings as a list.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate through the input string to find the positions of the double quotation marks.\n2. Whenever we find a pair of quotation marks, we will extract the substring between them.\n3. We will store each extracted substring in a list.\n4. Finally, we will return the list of extracted substrings.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize an empty list `results` to store the extracted substrings.\n2. Initialize a variable `start` to `None` to keep track of the position of the last opening quotation mark.\n3. Iterate over each character in the string along with its index:\n   - If the character is a double quotation mark:\n     - If `start` is `None`, set `start` to the current index (indicating an opening quote).\n     - Otherwise, extract the substring from `start + 1` to the current index (indicating a closing quote) and append it to `results`.\n     - Reset `start` to `None`.\n4. Return the `results` list.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef extract_quotation(s: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted substrings\n    results = []\n    # Variable to track the position of the last opening quotation mark\n    start = None\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string with its index\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        # Check if the character is a double quotation mark\n        if char == '\"':\n            # If start is None, this is an opening quote\n            if start is None:\n                start = i\n            else:\n                # This is a closing quote, extract the substring\n                results.append(s[start + 1:i])\n                # Reset start to None for the next pair of quotes\n                start = None\n    \n    # Return the list of extracted substrings\n    return results\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the string once, checking for pairs of quotation marks and extracting the substrings between them. It efficiently handles the task using a single pass through the string.",
