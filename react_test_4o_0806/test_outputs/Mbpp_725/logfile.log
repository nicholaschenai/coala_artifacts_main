INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/725 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the substrings that are enclosed in double quotation marks. The function should return these substrings as a list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through the input string to find the positions of the double quotation marks.
2. Whenever we find a pair of quotation marks, we will extract the substring between them.
3. We will store each extracted substring in a list.
4. Finally, we will return the list of extracted substrings.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty list `results` to store the extracted substrings.
2. Initialize a variable `start` to `None` to keep track of the position of the last opening quotation mark.
3. Iterate over each character in the string along with its index:
   - If the character is a double quotation mark:
     - If `start` is `None`, set `start` to the current index (indicating an opening quote).
     - Otherwise, extract the substring from `start + 1` to the current index (indicating a closing quote) and append it to `results`.
     - Reset `start` to `None`.
4. Return the `results` list.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def extract_quotation(s: str) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted substrings
    results = []
    # Variable to track the position of the last opening quotation mark
    start = None
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string with its index
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Check if the character is a double quotation mark
        if char == '"':
            # If start is None, this is an opening quote
            if start is None:
                start = i
            else:
                # This is a closing quote, extract the substring
                results.append(s[start + 1:i])
                # Reset start to None for the next pair of quotes
                start = None
    
    # Return the list of extracted substrings
    return results
```

This solution iterates through the string once, checking for pairs of quotation marks and extracting the substrings between them. It efficiently handles the task using a single pass through the string.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through the input string to find the positions of the double quotation marks.
2. Whenever we find a pair of quotation marks, we will extract the substring between them.
3. We will store each extracted substring in a list.
4. Finally, we will return the list of extracted substrings.

1. Initialize an empty list `results` to store the extracted substrings.
2. Initialize a variable `start` to `None` to keep track of the position of the last opening quotation mark.
3. Iterate over each character in the string along with its index:
   - If the character is a double quotation mark:
     - If `start` is `None`, set `start` to the current index (indicating an opening quote).
     - Otherwise, extract the substring from `start + 1` to the current index (indicating a closing quote) and append it to `results`.
     - Reset `start` to `None`.
4. Return the `results` list.

    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted substrings
    results = []
    # Variable to track the position of the last opening quotation mark

    # Iterate over each character in the string with its index
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Check if the character is a double quotation mark
        if char == '"':
            # If start is None, this is an opening quote
            if start is None:
                start = i
            else:
                # This is a closing quote, extract the substring
                results.append(s[start + 1:i])

                start = None
    
    # Return the list of extracted substrings
    return results
