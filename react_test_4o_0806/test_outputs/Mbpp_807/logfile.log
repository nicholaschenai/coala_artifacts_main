You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/807 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the first odd number found in that list. If the list contains only odd numbers, the function should return the first element of the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Iterate through each number in the list.
   - Check if the current number is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`).
   - If a number is odd (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`), return that number immediately.
   - Since the problem guarantees that there is at least one odd number in the list, we don't need to handle the case where no odd number is found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function first_odd(numbers):
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is odd:
               return number
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def first_odd(numbers):
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is odd
        if number % 2 != 0:
            # Return the first odd number found
            return number
```

This function will correctly return the first odd number from the list of numbers provided as input.
