    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the first odd number found in that list. If the list contains only odd numbers, the function should return the first element of the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Iterate through each number in the list.\n   - Check if the current number is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`).\n   - If a number is odd (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`), return that number immediately.\n   - Since the problem guarantees that there is at least one odd number in the list, we don't need to handle the case where no odd number is found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function first_odd(numbers):\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is odd:\n               return number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef first_odd(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            # Return the first odd number found\n            return number\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the first odd number from the list of numbers provided as input.",
