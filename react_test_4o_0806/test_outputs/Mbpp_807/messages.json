If the list contains only odd numbers, the function should return the first element of the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Iterate through each number in the list.\n   - Check if the current number is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`).\n   - If a number is odd (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`), return that number immediately.\n   - Since the problem guarantees that there is at least one odd number in the list, we don't need to handle the case where no odd number is found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function first_odd(numbers):\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is odd:\n               return number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef first_odd(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            # Return the first odd number found\n            return number\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the first odd number from the list of numbers provided as input."
