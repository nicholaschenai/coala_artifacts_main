INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/109 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We are given a binary string and a number of rotations. We need to determine how many of the resulting binary numbers (after each rotation) are odd when interpreted as binary numbers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Rotations**: A rotation of a binary string involves moving the first character to the end of the string. For example, rotating "011001" once results in "110010".

2. **Binary to Decimal Conversion**: A binary number is odd if its least significant bit (the rightmost bit) is 1. Therefore, after each rotation, we only need to check if the last character of the rotated string is '1'.

3. **Counting Odd Numbers**: We will perform the specified number of rotations on the binary string and count how many times the resulting binary number is odd.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a counter `odd_count` to 0.
2. For each rotation from 0 to `n-1` (where `n` is the number of rotations):
   - Rotate the binary string by moving the first character to the end.
   - Check if the last character of the rotated string is '1'.
   - If it is '1', increment the `odd_count`.
3. Return the `odd_count`.

### Python Code

```python
def odd_Equivalent(binary_string: str, rotations: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the count of odd numbers
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Convert the binary string to a list for easier manipulation
    binary_list = list(binary_string)
    
    # Perform the rotations
    for _ in range(rotations):
        # Rotate the binary string by moving the first character to the end
        first_char = binary_list.pop(0)
        binary_list.append(first_char)
        
        # Check if the last character is '1' (indicating an odd number)
        if binary_list[-1] == '1':
            odd_count += 1
    
    # Return the count of odd numbers
    return odd_count
```

This code follows the plan by rotating the binary string the specified number of times and counting how many of those rotations result in an odd binary number. The key observation is that a binary number is odd if its last digit is '1'.
