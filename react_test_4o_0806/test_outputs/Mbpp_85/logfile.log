You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the surface area of a sphere given its radius. The function should return the surface area as a floating-point number.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The formula for the surface area of a sphere is \(4 \pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.
   - We will use the value of \(\pi\) from Python's `math` module.
   - The function will take the radius as an input, compute the surface area using the formula, and return the result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Import the `math` module to access the value of \(\pi\).
   - Define a function `surfacearea_sphere` that takes one parameter `radius`.
   - Inside the function, calculate the surface area using the formula \(4 \times \text{math.pi} \times \text{radius}^2\).
   - Return the calculated surface area.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
import math

# Function to calculate the surface area of a sphere
def surfacearea_sphere(radius: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the surface area using the formula 4 * pi * r^2
    surface_area = 4 * math.pi * radius ** 2
    # Return the calculated surface area
    return surface_area
```

This code defines a function `surfacearea_sphere` that calculates and returns the surface area of a sphere given its radius, using the formula \(4 \pi r^2\). The `math` module is used to provide the value of \(\pi\).
