The function should return the surface area as a floating-point number.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The formula for the surface area of a sphere is \\(4 \\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the sphere.\n   - We will use the value of \\(\\pi\\) from Python's `math` module.\n   - The function will take the radius as an input, compute the surface area using the formula, and return the result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Import the `math` module to access the value of \\(\\pi\\).\n   - Define a function `surfacearea_sphere` that takes one parameter `radius`.\n   - Inside the function, calculate the surface area using the formula \\(4 \\times \\text{math.pi} \\times \\text{radius}^2\\).\n   - Return the calculated surface area.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to calculate the surface area of a sphere\ndef surfacearea_sphere(radius: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the surface area using the formula 4 * pi * r^2\n    surface_area = 4 * math.pi * radius ** 2\n    # Return the calculated surface area\n    return surface_area\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `surfacearea_sphere` that calculates and returns the surface area of a sphere given its radius, using the formula \\(4 \\pi r^2\\). The `math` module is used to provide the value of \\(\\pi\\)."
