For example, if `n` is 0, the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 1 (since 2^0 = 1).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` is 1.\n2. If `n` is greater than 0, we need to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`. We can do this by starting with 1 (which is 2^0) and keep multiplying by 2 until the result is greater than or equal to `n`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction next_power_of_2(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 1\n    power = 1\n    while power < n:\n        power = power * 2\n    return power\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef next_power_of_2(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is less than or equal to 0, the smallest power of 2 is 1\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1 (2^0)\n    power = 1\n    \n    # Keep multiplying by 2 until power is greater than or equal to n\n    while power < n:\n        power *= 2\n    \n    # Return the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n\n    return power\n```"
