We need to iterate through each element in the list.\n2. If an element is a list itself, we need to recursively call the function to handle this sublist.\n3. If an element is an integer, we add it to a running total.\n4. Continue this process until all elements have been processed.\n5. Return the total sum of all elements.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction recursive_list_sum(lst):\n    initialize total_sum to 0\n    for each element in lst:\n        if element is a list:\n            add the result of recursive_list_sum(element) to total_sum\n        else:\n            add element to total_sum\n    return total_sum\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef recursive_list_sum(lst):\n    # Initialize the total sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # If the element is a list, recursively sum its elements\n        if isinstance(element, list):\n            total_sum += recursive_list_sum(element)\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, add the element directly to the total sum\n            total_sum += element\n    \n    # Return the total sum of all elements\n    return total_sum\n```"
