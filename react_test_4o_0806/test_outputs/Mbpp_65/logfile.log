You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/65 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a nested list (a list that can contain other lists) and returns the sum of all the elements in the list, regardless of their level of nesting.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We need to iterate through each element in the list.
2. If an element is a list itself, we need to recursively call the function to handle this sublist.
3. If an element is an integer, we add it to a running total.
4. Continue this process until all elements have been processed.
5. Return the total sum of all elements.

## Pseudocode

```
function recursive_list_sum(lst):
    initialize total_sum to 0
    for each element in lst:
        if element is a list:
            add the result of recursive_list_sum(element) to total_sum
        else:
            add element to total_sum
    return total_sum
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def recursive_list_sum(lst):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for element in lst:
        # If the element is a list, recursively sum its elements
        if isinstance(element, list):
            total_sum += recursive_list_sum(element)
        else:
            # Otherwise, add the element directly to the total sum
            total_sum += element
    
    # Return the total sum of all elements
    return total_sum
```
