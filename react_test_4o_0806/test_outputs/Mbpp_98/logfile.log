You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/98 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers, multiplies all the numbers together, and then divides the result by the number of elements in the list. The function should return this final value.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, we need to multiply all the numbers in the list together. This can be done by initializing a variable to 1 and then iterating through the list, multiplying each number with this variable.
   - Next, we need to find the length of the list, which is the number of elements in it.
   - Finally, we divide the product of the numbers by the length of the list to get the desired result.
   - Return this result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function multiply_num(numbers):
       initialize product to 1
       for each number in numbers:
           multiply product by number
       length_of_list = length of numbers
       result = product divided by length_of_list
       return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def multiply_num(numbers):
    # Initialize the product to 1
    product = 1
    
    # Multiply all numbers in the list
    for number in numbers:
        product *= number
    
    # Calculate the length of the list
    length_of_list = len(numbers)
    
    # Divide the product by the length of the list
    result = product / length_of_list
    
    # Return the result
    return result
```

    # Calculate the length of the list
    length_of_list = len(numbers)
