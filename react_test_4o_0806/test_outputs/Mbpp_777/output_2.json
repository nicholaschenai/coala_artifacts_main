Let's adjust the solution to ensure it correctly identifies and sums elements that are not part of any repetition in the list.\n\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        if element in count_dict:\n            count_dict[element] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[element] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize the sum of non-repeated elements\n    sum_of_non_repeated = 0\n    \n    # Sum up elements that are not repeated\n    for key, value in count_dict.items():\n        if value == 1:\n            sum_of_non_repeated += key\n    \n    # Return the sum of non-repeated elements\n    return sum_of_non_repeated\n```\n\nThis code should correctly compute the sum of elements that appear exactly once in the list, which aligns with the problem statement. If the expected result is still `21`, there might be a misunderstanding in the test case setup or the problem statement.",
