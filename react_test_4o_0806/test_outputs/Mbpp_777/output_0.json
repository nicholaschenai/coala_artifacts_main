    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all elements that appear only once in the list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, we need to identify which elements in the list are non-repeated, i.e., they appear exactly once.\n   - We can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the list.\n   - After counting, we will iterate through the dictionary and sum up the elements that have a count of one.\n   - Finally, return this sum as the result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function find_sum with parameter lst\n       Create an empty dictionary called count_dict\n       For each element in lst\n           If element is in count_dict\n               Increment its value by 1\n           Else\n               Add element to count_dict with value 1\n       Initialize sum_of_non_repeated to 0\n       For each key, value pair in count_dict\n           If value is 1\n               Add key to sum_of_non_repeated\n       Return sum_of_non_repeated\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        if element in count_dict:\n            count_dict[element] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[element] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize the sum of non-repeated elements\n    sum_of_non_repeated = 0\n    \n    # Sum up elements that appear exactly once\n    for key, value in count_dict.items():\n        if value == 1:\n            sum_of_non_repeated += key\n    \n    # Return the sum of non-repeated elements\n    return sum_of_non_repeated\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list, as specified in the problem statement.",
