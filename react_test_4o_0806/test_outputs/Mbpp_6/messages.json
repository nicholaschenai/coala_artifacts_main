        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if two given integers differ by exactly one bit in their binary representation. This means that when we compare the binary forms of the two numbers, they should differ in exactly one position.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Convert both numbers to their binary form.\n2. Use the XOR operation on the two numbers. The XOR operation will result in a binary number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different.\n3. Check if the result of the XOR operation is a power of two. A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation. This would mean that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Perform XOR operation on the two numbers.\n2. Check if the result of the XOR operation is a power of two:\n   - A number is a power of two if `n & (n - 1) == 0` and `n != 0`.\n3. Return `True` if the result is a power of two, otherwise return `False`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n    # Perform XOR operation on the two numbers\n    xor_result = a ^ b\n    \n    # Check if the result is a power of two\n    # A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set\n    # This can be checked using the condition: n & (n - 1) == 0 and n != 0\n    return xor_result != 0 and (xor_result & (xor_result - 1)) == 0\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The XOR operation (`a ^ b`) gives a number where each bit is 1 if the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are different.\n- If the result of the XOR operation is a power of two, it means that there is exactly one bit set to 1, indicating that `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position.\n- The condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if `xor_result` is a power of two. The additional check `xor_result != 0` ensures that the result is not zero, which would mean the numbers are identical."
