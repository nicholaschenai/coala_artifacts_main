    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the negative numbers in that list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of negative numbers.\n   - Iterate through each number in the list.\n   - Check if the current number is negative.\n   - If it is negative, add it to the sum.\n   - After iterating through the list, return the sum of the negative numbers.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function sum_negativenum(numbers):\n       initialize sum_of_negatives to 0\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is less than 0:\n               add number to sum_of_negatives\n       return sum_of_negatives\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_negativenum(numbers):\n    # Initialize the sum of negative numbers to 0\n    sum_of_negatives = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is negative\n        if number < 0:\n            # Add the negative number to the sum\n            sum_of_negatives += number\n    \n    # Return the total sum of negative numbers\n    return sum_of_negatives\n```\n\nThis function will correctly calculate the sum of all negative numbers in a given list, as required by the problem statement.",
