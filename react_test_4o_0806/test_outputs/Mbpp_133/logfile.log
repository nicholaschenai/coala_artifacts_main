You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/133 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the negative numbers in that list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of negative numbers.
   - Iterate through each number in the list.
   - Check if the current number is negative.
   - If it is negative, add it to the sum.
   - After iterating through the list, return the sum of the negative numbers.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_negativenum(numbers):
       initialize sum_of_negatives to 0
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is less than 0:
               add number to sum_of_negatives
       return sum_of_negatives
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_negativenum(numbers):
    # Initialize the sum of negative numbers to 0
    sum_of_negatives = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is negative
        if number < 0:
            # Add the negative number to the sum
            sum_of_negatives += number
    
    # Return the total sum of negative numbers
    return sum_of_negatives
```

This function will correctly calculate the sum of all negative numbers in a given list, as required by the problem statement.
