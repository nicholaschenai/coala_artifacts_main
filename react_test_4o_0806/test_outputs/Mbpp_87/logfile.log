You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/87 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes three dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any duplicate keys among the dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary with that key should be used in the merged dictionary.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will take three dictionaries as input.
2. We will create a new dictionary to store the merged result.
3. We will update this new dictionary with the key-value pairs from each of the three input dictionaries in sequence.
4. If a key appears in more than one dictionary, the value from the last dictionary containing that key will be used.
5. Finally, we will return the merged dictionary.

## Pseudocode

```
function merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):
    create an empty dictionary called merged_dict
    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict1
    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict2
    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict3
    return merged_dict
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1: dict, dict2: dict, dict3: dict) -> dict:
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the merged result
    merged_dict = {}
    
    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the first dictionary
    merged_dict.update(dict1)
    
    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the second dictionary
    merged_dict.update(dict2)
    
    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the third dictionary
    merged_dict.update(dict3)
    
    # Return the merged dictionary
    return merged_dict
