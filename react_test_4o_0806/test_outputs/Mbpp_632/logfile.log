You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/632 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and moves all the zeroes in the list to the end, while maintaining the order of the non-zero elements.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a new list to store the result.
2. Iterate through the given list and append all non-zero elements to the new list.
3. Count the number of zeroes in the original list.
4. Append the counted number of zeroes to the end of the new list.
5. Return the new list.

## Pseudocode

```
function move_zero(lst):
    result = []
    zero_count = 0
    
    for each element in lst:
        if element is not zero:
            append element to result
        else:
            increment zero_count by 1
    
    for i from 0 to zero_count:
        append 0 to result
    
    return result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def move_zero(lst):
    # Initialize an empty list to store non-zero elements
    result = []
    # Initialize a counter for zeroes
    zero_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each element in the input list
    for element in lst:
        # If the element is not zero, add it to the result list
        if element != 0:
            result.append(element)
        else:
            # If the element is zero, increment the zero counter
            zero_count += 1
    
    # Append the counted number of zeroes to the end of the result list
    result.extend([0] * zero_count)
    
    # Return the modified list with zeroes moved to the end
    return result
```
