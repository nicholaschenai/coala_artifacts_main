The function should only keep the elements that are not tuples themselves.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each element in the input tuple.\n   - For each element, we will check if it is a tuple.\n   - If the element is not a tuple, we will add it to a new list.\n   - Finally, we will convert this list back into a tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function remove_nested with parameter input_tuple\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each element in input_tuple\n           If the element is not a tuple\n               Append the element to result\n       Convert result list to a tuple\n       Return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_nested(input_tuple):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store non-tuple elements\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the input tuple\n    for element in input_tuple:\n        # Check if the element is not a tuple\n        if not isinstance(element, tuple):\n            # Append non-tuple elements to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Convert the result list back to a tuple\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThis function will iterate through the input tuple, filter out any elements that are tuples, and return a new tuple containing only the non-tuple elements."
