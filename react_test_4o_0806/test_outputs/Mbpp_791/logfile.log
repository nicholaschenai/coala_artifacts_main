You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/791 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a tuple as input and returns a new tuple with all nested tuples removed. The function should only keep the elements that are not tuples themselves.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over each element in the input tuple.
   - For each element, we will check if it is a tuple.
   - If the element is not a tuple, we will add it to a new list.
   - Finally, we will convert this list back into a tuple and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function remove_nested with parameter input_tuple
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each element in input_tuple
           If the element is not a tuple
               Append the element to result
       Convert result list to a tuple
       Return the tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def remove_nested(input_tuple):
    # Initialize an empty list to store non-tuple elements
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each element in the input tuple
    for element in input_tuple:
        # Check if the element is not a tuple
        if not isinstance(element, tuple):
            # Append non-tuple elements to the result list
            result.append(element)
    
    # Convert the result list back to a tuple
    return tuple(result)
```

This function will iterate through the input tuple, filter out any elements that are tuples, and return a new tuple containing only the non-tuple elements.
