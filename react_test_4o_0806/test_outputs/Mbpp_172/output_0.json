    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that counts how many times the substring \"std\" appears in a given string. The function should return this count as an integer.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will use Python's built-in string method `count()` to find the number of occurrences of the substring \"std\" in the input string.\n2. The `count()` method is efficient and directly provides the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring in a string.\n3. We will define a function `count_occurance` that takes a single string as input and returns the count of \"std\" in that string.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_occurance(input_string):\n    return input_string.count(\"std\")\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_occurance(input_string: str) -> int:\n    # Use the built-in string method count to find the number of occurrences of \"std\"\n    return input_string.count(\"std\")\n```",
