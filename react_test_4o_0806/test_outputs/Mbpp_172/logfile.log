You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/172 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that counts how many times the substring "std" appears in a given string. The function should return this count as an integer.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will use Python's built-in string method `count()` to find the number of occurrences of the substring "std" in the input string.
2. The `count()` method is efficient and directly provides the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring in a string.
3. We will define a function `count_occurance` that takes a single string as input and returns the count of "std" in that string.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_occurance(input_string):
    return input_string.count("std")
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_occurance(input_string: str) -> int:
    # Use the built-in string method count to find the number of occurrences of "std"
    return input_string.count("std")
```
INFO - program_code:
 
def count_occurance(input_string: str) -> int:
