You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/757 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that counts the number of pairs of strings in a given list where one string is the reverse of the other. For example, in the list `["julia", "best", "tseb", "for", "ailuj"]`, the pairs `("julia", "ailuj")` and `("best", "tseb")` are reverse pairs.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize a Counter**: Start with a counter set to zero to keep track of the number of reverse pairs.
2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to go through each string in the list.
3. **Check for Reverse Pairs**: For each string, check if its reverse exists in the list.
4. **Avoid Double Counting**: If a reverse pair is found, increment the counter and remove both strings from the list to avoid counting them again.
5. **Return the Counter**: After checking all strings, return the counter value.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_reverse_pairs(string_list):
    initialize counter to 0
    while string_list is not empty:
        pop the first string from the list
        reverse the string
        if the reversed string is in the list:
            increment the counter
            remove the reversed string from the list
    return counter
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def count_reverse_pairs(string_list):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of reverse pairs
    count = 0
    
    # Convert the list to a set for faster lookup
    string_set = set(string_list)
    
    # Iterate over each string in the original list
    for string in string_list:
        # Reverse the current string
        reversed_string = string[::-1]
        
        # Check if the reversed string is in the set
        if reversed_string in string_set:
            # Increment the counter for a found pair
            count += 1
            
            # Remove both the string and its reverse from the set
            string_set.remove(string)
            string_set.remove(reversed_string)
    
    # Return the total count of reverse pairs
    return count
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a set to store the strings for O(1) average time complexity for lookups and removals.
- We iterate over each string in the list, reverse it, and check if the reversed string is in the set.
- If a reverse pair is found, we increment the counter and remove both the string and its reverse from the set to prevent double counting.
- Finally, we return the count of reverse pairs.
