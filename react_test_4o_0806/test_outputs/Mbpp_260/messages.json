        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the nth Newman\u2013Shanks\u2013Williams (NSW) prime number. The NSW prime numbers are a sequence of numbers defined by a specific recurrence relation. The task is to find the nth number in this sequence.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Sequence**: The Newman\u2013Shanks\u2013Williams prime numbers are defined by the recurrence relation:\n   - \\( S_0 = 1 \\)\n   - \\( S_1 = 1 \\)\n   - \\( S_n = 2 \\times S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \\) for \\( n \\geq 2 \\)\n\n2. **Generate the Sequence**: To find the nth NSW prime, we need to generate the sequence up to the nth term using the recurrence relation.\n\n3. **Return the nth Term**: Once the sequence is generated up to the nth term, return the nth term as the result.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction newman_prime(n):\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    initialize S0 = 1\n    initialize S1 = 1\n    for i from 2 to n:\n        calculate Si = 2 * S1 + S0\n        update S0 = S1\n        update S1 = Si\n    return Si\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef newman_prime(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base cases for the sequence\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two terms of the sequence\n    S0 = 1\n    S1 = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the sequence up to the nth term\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the next term using the recurrence relation\n        Si = 2 * S1 + S0\n        # Update the previous terms for the next iteration\n        S0 = S1\n        S1 = Si\n    \n    # Return the nth term\n    return Si\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the recurrence relation for the Newman\u2013Shanks\u2013Williams sequence and returns the nth term, which is the desired result."
