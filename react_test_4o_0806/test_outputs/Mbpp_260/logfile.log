INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams (NSW) prime number. The NSW prime numbers are a sequence of numbers defined by a specific recurrence relation. The task is to find the nth number in this sequence.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Sequence**: The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime numbers are defined by the recurrence relation:
   - \( S_0 = 1 \)
   - \( S_1 = 1 \)
   - \( S_n = 2 \times S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

2. **Generate the Sequence**: To find the nth NSW prime, we need to generate the sequence up to the nth term using the recurrence relation.

3. **Return the nth Term**: Once the sequence is generated up to the nth term, return the nth term as the result.

## Pseudocode

```
function newman_prime(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    initialize S0 = 1
    initialize S1 = 1
    for i from 2 to n:
        calculate Si = 2 * S1 + S0
        update S0 = S1
        update S1 = Si
    return Si
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def newman_prime(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases for the sequence
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first two terms of the sequence
    S0 = 1
    S1 = 1
    
    # Calculate the sequence up to the nth term
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Calculate the next term using the recurrence relation
        Si = 2 * S1 + S0
        # Update the previous terms for the next iteration
        S0 = S1
        S1 = Si
    
    # Return the nth term
    return Si
```

This code correctly implements the recurrence relation for the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams sequence and returns the nth term, which is the desired result.
