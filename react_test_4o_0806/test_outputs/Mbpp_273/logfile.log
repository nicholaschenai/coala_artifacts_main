You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/273 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. Each tuple contains numbers. The function should subtract each element of the first tuple by the corresponding element in the second tuple (i.e., element-wise subtraction) and return a new tuple with the results.

### Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
2. For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will subtract the element from the second tuple from the element in the first tuple.
3. We will store the result of each subtraction in a new tuple.
4. Finally, we will return the new tuple containing all the results.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `substract_elements` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
2. Initialize an empty list `result`.
3. Loop over the indices of the tuples (assuming both tuples are of the same length):
   - Subtract the element at the current index of `tuple2` from the element at the same index of `tuple1`.
   - Append the result to the `result` list.
4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple.
5. Return the resulting tuple.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def substract_elements(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the subtraction
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Subtract the element in tuple2 from the element in tuple1 at the same index
        subtraction = tuple1[i] - tuple2[i]
        # Append the result to the result list
        result.append(subtraction)
    
    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
```
