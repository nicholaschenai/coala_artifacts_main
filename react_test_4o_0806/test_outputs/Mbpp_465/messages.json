Essentially, we are filtering out any entries in the dictionary that have `None` as their value.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary. For each pair, we will check if the value is not `None`. If the value is not `None`, we will include this pair in the new dictionary. Finally, we will return the new dictionary that contains only the non-empty items.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named drop_empty that takes a dictionary as input.\n   Initialize an empty dictionary to store non-empty items.\n   For each key-value pair in the input dictionary:\n       If the value is not None:\n           Add the key-value pair to the new dictionary.\n   Return the new dictionary.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef drop_empty(d: dict) -> dict:\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store non-empty items\n    non_empty_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary\n    for key, value in d.items():\n        # Check if the value is not None\n        if value is not None:\n            # Add the key-value pair to the new dictionary\n            non_empty_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Return the new dictionary containing only non-empty items\n    return non_empty_dict\n```"
