You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/465 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary with all the key-value pairs where the value is not `None`. Essentially, we are filtering out any entries in the dictionary that have `None` as their value.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary. For each pair, we will check if the value is not `None`. If the value is not `None`, we will include this pair in the new dictionary. Finally, we will return the new dictionary that contains only the non-empty items.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function named drop_empty that takes a dictionary as input.
   Initialize an empty dictionary to store non-empty items.
   For each key-value pair in the input dictionary:
       If the value is not None:
           Add the key-value pair to the new dictionary.
   Return the new dictionary.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def drop_empty(d: dict) -> dict:
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store non-empty items
    non_empty_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary
    for key, value in d.items():
        # Check if the value is not None
        if value is not None:
            # Add the key-value pair to the new dictionary
            non_empty_dict[key] = value
    
    # Return the new dictionary containing only non-empty items
    return non_empty_dict
