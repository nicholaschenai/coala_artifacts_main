You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/7 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of words from that string which are at least 4 characters long.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Split the input string into individual words.
   - Iterate over each word and check its length.
   - If a word is 4 or more characters long, add it to a list.
   - Return the list of words that meet the length requirement.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function find_char_long that takes a string as input
       Split the string into words using spaces as delimiters
       Initialize an empty list to store words that are at least 4 characters long
       For each word in the list of words
           If the length of the word is 4 or more
               Add the word to the list of long words
       Return the list of long words
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_char_long(s: str) -> list:
    # Split the input string into words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store words that are at least 4 characters long
    long_words = []
    
    # Iterate over each word in the list of words
    for word in words:
        # Check if the word is at least 4 characters long
        if len(word) >= 4:
            # Add the word to the list of long words
            long_words.append(word)
    
    # Return the list of long words
