    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of words from that string which are at least 4 characters long.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Split the input string into individual words.\n   - Iterate over each word and check its length.\n   - If a word is 4 or more characters long, add it to a list.\n   - Return the list of words that meet the length requirement.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function find_char_long that takes a string as input\n       Split the string into words using spaces as delimiters\n       Initialize an empty list to store words that are at least 4 characters long\n       For each word in the list of words\n           If the length of the word is 4 or more\n               Add the word to the list of long words\n       Return the list of long words\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_char_long(s: str) -> list:\n    # Split the input string into words\n    words = s.split()\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store words that are at least 4 characters long\n    long_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word is at least 4 characters long\n        if len(word) >= 4:\n            # Add the word to the list of long words\n            long_words.append(word)\n    \n    # Return the list of long words\n    return long_words\n```",
