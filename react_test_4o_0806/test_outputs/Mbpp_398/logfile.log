You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/398 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all the digits of each number in the list. For example, given the list `[10, 2, 56]`, the function should return `14` because the sum of the digits is `1 + 0 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 14`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum of digits.
2. Iterate over each number in the list.
3. For each number, convert it to a string to easily access each digit.
4. Convert each character (digit) back to an integer and add it to the total sum.
5. After processing all numbers, return the total sum.

## Pseudocode

```
function sum_of_digits(numbers):
    total_sum = 0
    for each number in numbers:
        convert number to string
        for each character in string:
            convert character to integer
            add integer to total_sum
    return total_sum
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_of_digits(numbers):
    # Initialize the total sum of digits to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Convert the number to a string to access each digit
        str_number = str(number)
        
        # Iterate over each character in the string representation of the number
        for char in str_number:
            # Convert the character back to an integer
            digit = int(char)
            
            # Add the digit to the total sum
            total_sum += digit
    
    # Return the total sum of all digits
    return total_sum
