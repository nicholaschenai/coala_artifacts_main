        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all the digits of each number in the list. For example, given the list `[10, 2, 56]`, the function should return `14` because the sum of the digits is `1 + 0 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 14`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum of digits.\n2. Iterate over each number in the list.\n3. For each number, convert it to a string to easily access each digit.\n4. Convert each character (digit) back to an integer and add it to the total sum.\n5. After processing all numbers, return the total sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction sum_of_digits(numbers):\n    total_sum = 0\n    for each number in numbers:\n        convert number to string\n        for each character in string:\n            convert character to integer\n            add integer to total_sum\n    return total_sum\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(numbers):\n    # Initialize the total sum of digits to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Convert the number to a string to access each digit\n        str_number = str(number)\n        \n        # Iterate over each character in the string representation of the number\n        for char in str_number:\n            # Convert the character back to an integer\n            digit = int(char)\n            \n            # Add the digit to the total sum\n            total_sum += digit\n    \n    # Return the total sum of all digits\n    return total_sum\n```"
