You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if there is any common element between two sequences. If there is at least one common element, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input**: Two sequences (e.g., lists, tuples).
2. **Output**: A boolean value (`True` or `False`).
3. **Approach**:
   - Iterate through each element in the first sequence.
   - For each element, check if it exists in the second sequence.
   - If a common element is found, return `True`.
   - If no common elements are found after checking all elements, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

```
function overlapping(seq1, seq2):
    for each element in seq1:
        if element is in seq2:
            return True
    return False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def overlapping(seq1, seq2):
    # Iterate over each element in the first sequence
    for element in seq1:
        # Check if the current element is present in the second sequence
        if element in seq2:
            # If a common element is found, return True
            return True
    # If no common elements are found, return False
    return False
```
