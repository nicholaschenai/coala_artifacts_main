If there is at least one common element, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input**: Two sequences (e.g., lists, tuples).\n2. **Output**: A boolean value (`True` or `False`).\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Iterate through each element in the first sequence.\n   - For each element, check if it exists in the second sequence.\n   - If a common element is found, return `True`.\n   - If no common elements are found after checking all elements, return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    for each element in seq1:\n        if element is in seq2:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    # Iterate over each element in the first sequence\n    for element in seq1:\n        # Check if the current element is present in the second sequence\n        if element in seq2:\n            # If a common element is found, return True\n            return True\n    # If no common elements are found, return False\n    return False\n```",
