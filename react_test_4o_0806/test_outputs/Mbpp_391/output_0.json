    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes three lists as input: one list of IDs, one list of names, and one list of scores. The function should return a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a nested structure. Each dictionary should have an ID as the key, and the value should be another dictionary with the name as the key and the score as the value.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over the indices of the input lists since they are of the same length.\n   - For each index, we will create a dictionary where the key is the ID from the first list.\n   - The value of this key will be another dictionary where the key is the name from the second list and the value is the score from the third list.\n   - We will append each of these dictionaries to a result list.\n   - Finally, we will return the result list.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function convert_list_dictionary with three parameters: ids, names, scores\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each index i from 0 to length of ids - 1\n           Create a dictionary with ids[i] as the key\n           The value of this key is another dictionary with names[i] as the key and scores[i] as the value\n           Append this dictionary to the result list\n       Return the result list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef convert_list_dictionary(ids, names, scores):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices of the input lists\n    for i in range(len(ids)):\n        # Create a nested dictionary for each index\n        nested_dict = {ids[i]: {names[i]: scores[i]}}\n        # Append the nested dictionary to the result list\n        result.append(nested_dict)\n    \n    # Return the final list of nested dictionaries\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code will take the three lists and convert them into a list of nested dictionaries as specified in the problem statement.",
