You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/391 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes three lists as input: one list of IDs, one list of names, and one list of scores. The function should return a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a nested structure. Each dictionary should have an ID as the key, and the value should be another dictionary with the name as the key and the score as the value.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over the indices of the input lists since they are of the same length.
   - For each index, we will create a dictionary where the key is the ID from the first list.
   - The value of this key will be another dictionary where the key is the name from the second list and the value is the score from the third list.
   - We will append each of these dictionaries to a result list.
   - Finally, we will return the result list.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function convert_list_dictionary with three parameters: ids, names, scores
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each index i from 0 to length of ids - 1
           Create a dictionary with ids[i] as the key
           The value of this key is another dictionary with names[i] as the key and scores[i] as the value
           Append this dictionary to the result list
       Return the result list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def convert_list_dictionary(ids, names, scores):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the input lists
    for i in range(len(ids)):
        # Create a nested dictionary for each index
        nested_dict = {ids[i]: {names[i]: scores[i]}}
        # Append the nested dictionary to the result list
        result.append(nested_dict)
    
    # Return the final list of nested dictionaries
    return result
```

This code will take the three lists and convert them into a list of nested dictionaries as specified in the problem statement.
