You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/619 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a string as input and moves all the numeric characters to the end of the string, while maintaining the order of both the non-numeric and numeric characters.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Traverse the input string character by character.
2. Separate the characters into two groups: 
   - Non-numeric characters
   - Numeric characters
3. Concatenate the non-numeric characters first, followed by the numeric characters.
4. Return the resulting string.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize two empty strings: `non_numeric` and `numeric`.
2. For each character `char` in the input string:
   - If `char` is a digit, append it to the `numeric` string.
   - Otherwise, append it to the `non_numeric` string.
3. Concatenate `non_numeric` and `numeric` strings.
4. Return the concatenated string.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def move_num(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize empty strings for non-numeric and numeric characters
    non_numeric = ''
    numeric = ''
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is a digit
        if char.isdigit():
            # Append to numeric string if it is a digit
            numeric += char
        else:
            # Append to non-numeric string if it is not a digit
            non_numeric += char
    
    # Concatenate non-numeric and numeric strings
    result = non_numeric + numeric
    
    # Return the final result
    return result
```

This solution iterates over the input string once, separating characters into non-numeric and numeric categories, and then concatenates them in the required order.
