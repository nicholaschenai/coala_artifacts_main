        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cone. The function will take two inputs: the radius \\( r \\) of the base of the cone and the height \\( h \\) of the cone. The function should return the lateral surface area as a floating-point number.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Formula**: The lateral surface area \\( A \\) of a cone can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   A = \\pi \\times r \\times l\n   \\]\n   where \\( l \\) is the slant height of the cone. The slant height can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   l = \\sqrt{r^2 + h^2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Steps to Calculate**:\n   - Calculate the slant height \\( l \\) using the formula \\( l = \\sqrt{r^2 + h^2} \\).\n   - Use the slant height to calculate the lateral surface area using the formula \\( A = \\pi \\times r \\times l \\).\n\n3. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated lateral surface area.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction lateralsurface_cone(r, h):\n    calculate slant height l = sqrt(r^2 + h^2)\n    calculate lateral surface area A = \u03c0 * r * l\n    return A\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef lateralsurface_cone(r: float, h: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem\n    l = math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)\n    # Calculate the lateral surface area\n    lateral_surface_area = math.pi * r * l\n    # Return the lateral surface area\n    return lateral_surface_area\n```"
