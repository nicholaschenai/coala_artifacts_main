INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/731 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cone. The function will take two inputs: the radius \( r \) of the base of the cone and the height \( h \) of the cone. The function should return the lateral surface area as a floating-point number.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Formula**: The lateral surface area \( A \) of a cone can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \pi \times r \times l
   \]
   where \( l \) is the slant height of the cone. The slant height can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}
   \]

2. **Steps to Calculate**:
   - Calculate the slant height \( l \) using the formula \( l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2} \).
   - Use the slant height to calculate the lateral surface area using the formula \( A = \pi \times r \times l \).

3. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated lateral surface area.

## Pseudocode

```
function lateralsurface_cone(r, h):
    calculate slant height l = sqrt(r^2 + h^2)
    calculate lateral surface area A = Ï€ * r * l
    return A
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
import math

def lateralsurface_cone(r: float, h: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem
    l = math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)
    # Calculate the lateral surface area
    lateral_surface_area = math.pi * r * l
    # Return the lateral surface area
    return lateral_surface_area
```
