INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/252 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that converts a complex number into its polar coordinate representation. The polar coordinate representation of a complex number consists of two values: the magnitude (or modulus) and the angle (or argument) in radians.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Magnitude Calculation**: The magnitude of a complex number \( z = a + bi \) is calculated using the formula \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).
2. **Angle Calculation**: The angle (or argument) is calculated using the `atan2` function, which computes the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments, taking into account the signs of both arguments to determine the correct quadrant of the angle. For a complex number \( z = a + bi \), the angle is \( \text{atan2}(b, a) \).

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `convert` that takes a single argument `z`.
2. Extract the real part `a` and the imaginary part `b` from the complex number `z`.
3. Calculate the magnitude using the formula \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).
4. Calculate the angle using the `atan2` function with `b` and `a` as arguments.
5. Return a tuple containing the magnitude and the angle.

### Python Code

```python
import math

def convert(z: complex) -> tuple:
    # Extract real and imaginary parts
    a = z.real
    b = z.imag
    
    # Calculate magnitude
    magnitude = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
    
    # Calculate angle
    angle = math.atan2(b, a)
    
    # Return the polar coordinates as a tuple
    return (magnitude, angle)
```

This code defines a function `convert` that takes a complex number `z` and returns its polar coordinates as a tuple. The magnitude is calculated using the square root of the sum of squares of the real and imaginary parts, and the angle is calculated using the `atan2` function to ensure the correct quadrant is considered.
