INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/420 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we need to find the sum of the cubes of the first two even numbers, which are 2 and 4.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. Even natural numbers start from 2 and increase by 2 (i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...).
2. For each of these even numbers, calculate its cube.
3. Sum up all these cubes to get the final result.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a variable `sum_cubes` to 0 to store the sum of cubes.
2. Loop over the first `n` even natural numbers:
   - For each even number `i`, calculate its cube (`i**3`).
   - Add this cube to `sum_cubes`.
3. Return `sum_cubes`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def cube_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum of cubes to 0
    sum_cubes = 0
    
    # Loop over the first n even natural numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the i-th even number
        even_number = 2 * i
        # Add the cube of the even number to the sum
        sum_cubes += even_number ** 3
    
    # Return the total sum of cubes
    return sum_cubes
```

This function calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers by iterating through the first `n` even numbers, cubing each, and accumulating the result.
