    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we need to find the sum of the cubes of the first two even numbers, which are 2 and 4.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. Even natural numbers start from 2 and increase by 2 (i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...).\n2. For each of these even numbers, calculate its cube.\n3. Sum up all these cubes to get the final result.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a variable `sum_cubes` to 0 to store the sum of cubes.\n2. Loop over the first `n` even natural numbers:\n   - For each even number `i`, calculate its cube (`i**3`).\n   - Add this cube to `sum_cubes`.\n3. Return `sum_cubes`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef cube_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of cubes to 0\n    sum_cubes = 0\n    \n    # Loop over the first n even natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th even number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Add the cube of the even number to the sum\n        sum_cubes += even_number ** 3\n    \n    # Return the total sum of cubes\n    return sum_cubes\n```\n\nThis function calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers by iterating through the first `n` even numbers, cubing each, and accumulating the result.",
