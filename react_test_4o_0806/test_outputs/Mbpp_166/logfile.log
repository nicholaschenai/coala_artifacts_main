Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/166 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and counts how many pairs of integers in the list have an XOR result that is an even number.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR and Even Numbers**: 
   - XOR of two numbers is even if both numbers have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).
   - This is because XOR results in a binary number where a bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different. For the least significant bit (which determines evenness), if both numbers are even or both are odd, the result will be even.

2. **Approach**:
   - Count the number of even numbers and the number of odd numbers in the list.
   - Calculate the number of pairs of even numbers and the number of pairs of odd numbers.
   - The total number of pairs that XOR to an even number is the sum of these two counts.

3. **Steps**:
   - Initialize counters for even and odd numbers.
   - Iterate through the list and update the counters based on the parity of each number.
   - Calculate the number of pairs of even numbers using the combination formula `nC2 = n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - Calculate the number of pairs of odd numbers using the same formula.
   - Return the sum of these two values.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_even_pair(nums):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for each number in nums:
        if number is even:
            increment even_count
        else:
            increment odd_count
    
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_even_pair(nums):
    # Initialize counters for even and odd numbers
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Count the number of even and odd numbers in the list
    for num in nums:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of pairs of even numbers
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    # Calculate the number of pairs of odd numbers
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    
    # Return the total number of pairs that XOR to an even number
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
