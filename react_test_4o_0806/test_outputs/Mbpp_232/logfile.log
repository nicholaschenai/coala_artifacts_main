You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/232 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and an integer `n`, and returns a new list containing the `n` largest numbers from the original list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Sort the List**: First, we will sort the list in descending order so that the largest numbers come first.
2. **Select the Top `n` Elements**: After sorting, we can simply take the first `n` elements from this sorted list, as they will be the largest.
3. **Return the Result**: Return the list of these `n` largest numbers.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `larg_nnum` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`.
2. Sort `lst` in descending order.
3. Slice the first `n` elements from the sorted list.
4. Return the sliced list.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def larg_nnum(lst, n):
    # Step 1: Sort the list in descending order
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst, reverse=True)
    
    # Step 2: Take the first n elements from the sorted list
    largest_n = sorted_lst[:n]
    
    # Step 3: Return the list of n largest elements
    return largest_n
```
