Define a function `larg_nnum` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`.\n2. Sort `lst` in descending order.\n3. Slice the first `n` elements from the sorted list.\n4. Return the sliced list.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef larg_nnum(lst, n):\n    # Step 1: Sort the list in descending order\n    sorted_lst = sorted(lst, reverse=True)\n    \n    # Step 2: Take the first n elements from the sorted list\n    largest_n = sorted_lst[:n]\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the list of n largest elements\n    return largest_n\n```"
