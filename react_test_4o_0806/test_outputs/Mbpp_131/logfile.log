You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/131 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where only the vowels in the original string are reversed. The consonants and other characters should remain in their original positions. The vowels in this context are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase).

## Conceptual Solution

1. Identify all the vowels in the input string and store them in a list.
2. Reverse the list of vowels.
3. Create a new list to build the result string.
4. Iterate through the original string:
   - If the character is a vowel, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed list.
   - If the character is not a vowel, keep it unchanged.
5. Join the list into a string and return it.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `reverse_vowels` that takes a string `s`.
2. Create a set of vowels for quick lookup.
3. Initialize an empty list `vowels` to store the vowels from the string.
4. Iterate over each character in the string `s`:
   - If the character is a vowel, append it to the `vowels` list.
5. Reverse the `vowels` list.
6. Initialize an empty list `result` to build the final string.
7. Initialize a counter `vowel_index` to 0.
8. Iterate over each character in the string `s`:
   - If the character is a vowel, append the vowel at `vowel_index` from the reversed `vowels` list to `result` and increment `vowel_index`.
   - If the character is not a vowel, append it unchanged to `result`.
9. Join the `result` list into a string and return it.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def reverse_vowels(s: str) -> str:
    # Define a set of vowels for quick lookup
    vowels_set = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    
    # Extract all vowels from the string
    vowels = [char for char in s if char in vowels_set]
    
    # Reverse the list of vowels
    vowels.reverse()
    
    # Initialize a list to build the result string
    result = []
    
    # Initialize a counter to track the position in the reversed vowels list
    vowel_index = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the original string
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels_set:
            # If the character is a vowel, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed list
            result.append(vowels[vowel_index])
            vowel_index += 1
        else:
            # If the character is not a vowel, keep it unchanged
            result.append(char)
    
    # Join the list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(result)
