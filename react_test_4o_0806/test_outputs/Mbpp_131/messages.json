        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where only the vowels in the original string are reversed. The consonants and other characters should remain in their original positions. The vowels in this context are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Identify all the vowels in the input string and store them in a list.\n2. Reverse the list of vowels.\n3. Create a new list to build the result string.\n4. Iterate through the original string:\n   - If the character is a vowel, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed list.\n   - If the character is not a vowel, keep it unchanged.\n5. Join the list into a string and return it.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `reverse_vowels` that takes a string `s`.\n2. Create a set of vowels for quick lookup.\n3. Initialize an empty list `vowels` to store the vowels from the string.\n4. Iterate over each character in the string `s`:\n   - If the character is a vowel, append it to the `vowels` list.\n5. Reverse the `vowels` list.\n6. Initialize an empty list `result` to build the final string.\n7. Initialize a counter `vowel_index` to 0.\n8. Iterate over each character in the string `s`:\n   - If the character is a vowel, append the vowel at `vowel_index` from the reversed `vowels` list to `result` and increment `vowel_index`.\n   - If the character is not a vowel, append it unchanged to `result`.\n9. Join the `result` list into a string and return it.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef reverse_vowels(s: str) -> str:\n    # Define a set of vowels for quick lookup\n    vowels_set = set('aeiouAEIOU')\n    \n    # Extract all vowels from the string\n    vowels = [char for char in s if char in vowels_set]\n    \n    # Reverse the list of vowels\n    vowels.reverse()\n    \n    # Initialize a list to build the result string\n    result = []\n    \n    # Initialize a counter to track the position in the reversed vowels list\n    vowel_index = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the original string\n    for char in s:\n        if char in vowels_set:\n            # If the character is a vowel, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed list\n            result.append(vowels[vowel_index])\n            vowel_index += 1\n        else:\n            # If the character is not a vowel, keep it unchanged\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return it\n    return ''.join(result)\n```"
