INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given string expression containing brackets is balanced. An expression is considered balanced if every opening bracket has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing bracket. The types of brackets to consider are parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. The stack will help us keep track of the opening brackets as we encounter them. When we encounter a closing bracket, we will check if it matches the most recent opening bracket stored in the stack. If it matches, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. If it doesn't match or if the stack is empty when we encounter a closing bracket, the expression is not balanced. At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is not.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Create a dictionary to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
3. Iterate over each character in the expression:
   - If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket:
     - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, return False (unbalanced).
     - Pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If it doesn't match, return False.
4. After iterating through the expression, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return True (balanced); otherwise, return False.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_expression(expression: str) -> bool:
    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    # Dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    # Iterate over each character in the expression
    for char in expression:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if char in bracket_map.values():
            stack.append(char)
        # If the character is a closing bracket
        elif char in bracket_map:
            # If the stack is empty, it means there's no matching opening bracket
            if not stack:
                return False
            # Pop the top element from the stack
            top_element = stack.pop()
            # Check if the popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket
            if bracket_map[char] != top_element:
                return False
    
    # If the stack is empty, all opening brackets have been matched
    return not stack
```

This solution uses a stack to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing bracket, thus determining if the expression is balanced.
