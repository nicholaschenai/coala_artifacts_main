You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/722 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a dictionary where each key is a student's name and each value is a tuple containing the student's height and weight. We also have two additional inputs: a minimum height and a minimum weight. Our task is to filter out and return only those students who have both a height greater than or equal to the minimum height and a weight greater than or equal to the minimum weight.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We need to iterate over each student in the dictionary.
2. For each student, we will check if their height is greater than or equal to the given minimum height and if their weight is greater than or equal to the given minimum weight.
3. If both conditions are met, we will include that student in the result.
4. Finally, we will return a new dictionary containing only the students who meet both criteria.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty dictionary `filtered_students`.
2. For each `student` and `data` (tuple of height and weight) in the input dictionary:
   - Extract `height` and `weight` from `data`.
   - If `height` is greater than or equal to `min_height` and `weight` is greater than or equal to `min_weight`:
     - Add `student` and `data` to `filtered_students`.
3. Return `filtered_students`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def filter_data(students: dict, min_height: float, min_weight: float) -> dict:
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the filtered students
    filtered_students = {}
    
    # Iterate over each student and their corresponding height and weight
    for student, (height, weight) in students.items():
        # Check if both height and weight meet the minimum requirements
        if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight:
            # Add the student to the filtered dictionary
            filtered_students[student] = (height, weight)
    
    # Return the dictionary of filtered students
    return filtered_students
```

This solution iterates over each student in the input dictionary, checks if they meet the height and weight criteria, and constructs a new dictionary with only those students who meet both conditions.
