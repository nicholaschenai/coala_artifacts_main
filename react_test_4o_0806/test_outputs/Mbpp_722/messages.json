We also have two additional inputs: a minimum height and a minimum weight. Our task is to filter out and return only those students who have both a height greater than or equal to the minimum height and a weight greater than or equal to the minimum weight.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We need to iterate over each student in the dictionary.\n2. For each student, we will check if their height is greater than or equal to the given minimum height and if their weight is greater than or equal to the given minimum weight.\n3. If both conditions are met, we will include that student in the result.\n4. Finally, we will return a new dictionary containing only the students who meet both criteria.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary `filtered_students`.\n2. For each `student` and `data` (tuple of height and weight) in the input dictionary:\n   - Extract `height` and `weight` from `data`.\n   - If `height` is greater than or equal to `min_height` and `weight` is greater than or equal to `min_weight`:\n     - Add `student` and `data` to `filtered_students`.\n3. Return `filtered_students`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef filter_data(students: dict, min_height: float, min_weight: float) -> dict:\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the filtered students\n    filtered_students = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each student and their corresponding height and weight\n    for student, (height, weight) in students.items():\n        # Check if both height and weight meet the minimum requirements\n        if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight:\n            # Add the student to the filtered dictionary\n            filtered_students[student] = (height, weight)\n    \n    # Return the dictionary of filtered students\n    return filtered_students\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each student in the input dictionary, checks if they meet the height and weight criteria, and constructs a new dictionary with only those students who meet both conditions."
