    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a decimal (base-10) integer as input and returns its binary (base-2) representation as a string. The binary string should not have any leading zeros.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Binary Conversion**: \n   - A decimal number can be converted to binary by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\n2. **Steps to Convert Decimal to Binary**:\n   - Start with the given decimal number.\n   - Divide the number by 2.\n   - Record the remainder (0 or 1).\n   - Update the number to be the quotient of the division.\n   - Repeat the process until the number becomes zero.\n   - The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n3. **Edge Case**:\n   - If the input number is 0, the binary representation should be \"0\".\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction decimal_to_binary(n):\n    if n is 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    binary_string = \"\"\n    while n is greater than 0:\n        remainder = n % 2\n        binary_string = remainder + binary_string\n        n = n // 2\n    \n    return binary_string\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    # Handle the special case where the input is 0\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to build the binary representation\n    binary_string = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop until the number becomes zero\n    while n > 0:\n        # Get the remainder of the division by 2 (either 0 or 1)\n        remainder = n % 2\n        # Prepend the remainder to the binary string\n        binary_string = str(remainder) + binary_string\n        # Update the number to be the quotient of the division by 2\n        n = n // 2\n    \n    # Return the constructed binary string\n    return binary_string\n```\n\nThis code correctly converts a decimal number to its binary representation without leading zeros, handling the special case of zero appropriately.",
