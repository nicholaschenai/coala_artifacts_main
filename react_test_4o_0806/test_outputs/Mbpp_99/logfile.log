INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/99 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a decimal (base-10) integer as input and returns its binary (base-2) representation as a string. The binary string should not have any leading zeros.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Binary Conversion**: 
   - A decimal number can be converted to binary by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).

2. **Steps to Convert Decimal to Binary**:
   - Start with the given decimal number.
   - Divide the number by 2.
   - Record the remainder (0 or 1).
   - Update the number to be the quotient of the division.
   - Repeat the process until the number becomes zero.
   - The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.

3. **Edge Case**:
   - If the input number is 0, the binary representation should be "0".

## Pseudocode

```
function decimal_to_binary(n):
    if n is 0:
        return "0"
    
    binary_string = ""
    while n is greater than 0:
        remainder = n % 2
        binary_string = remainder + binary_string
        n = n // 2
    
    return binary_string
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:
    # Handle the special case where the input is 0
    if n == 0:
        return "0"
    
    # Initialize an empty string to build the binary representation
    binary_string = ""
    
    # Loop until the number becomes zero
    while n > 0:
        # Get the remainder of the division by 2 (either 0 or 1)
        remainder = n % 2
        # Prepend the remainder to the binary string
        binary_string = str(remainder) + binary_string
        # Update the number to be the quotient of the division by 2
        n = n // 2
    
    # Return the constructed binary string
    return binary_string
```

This code correctly converts a decimal number to its binary representation without leading zeros, handling the special case of zero appropriately.
