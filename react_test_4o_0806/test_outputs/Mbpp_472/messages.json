        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to determine if a given list of integers contains consecutive numbers. Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order, without any gaps. For example, the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is consecutive, but `[1, 3, 4, 5]` is not because there is a gap between 1 and 3.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - To check if a list contains consecutive numbers, we can first sort the list. Then, we iterate through the sorted list and check if each number is exactly one more than the previous number. If we find any number that is not one more than the previous number, the list is not consecutive. If we reach the end of the list without finding any such number, the list is consecutive.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Sort the list of numbers.\n   - Iterate through the sorted list from the first element to the second-to-last element.\n     - For each element, check if the next element is exactly one more than the current element.\n     - If any element does not satisfy this condition, return `False`.\n   - If all elements satisfy the condition, return `True`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(lst: list) -> bool:\n    # Step 1: Sort the list\n    lst.sort()\n    \n    # Step 2: Iterate through the sorted list\n    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):\n        # Step 3: Check if the next element is exactly one more than the current element\n        if lst[i] + 1 != lst[i + 1]:\n            # If not, the list is not consecutive\n            return False\n    \n    # Step 4: If all elements are consecutive, return True\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function sorts the list and checks for consecutive numbers by ensuring each number is followed by its successor. If any number is not followed by its successor, it returns `False`. If all numbers are consecutive, it returns `True`."
