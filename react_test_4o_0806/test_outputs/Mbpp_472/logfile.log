You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/472 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to determine if a given list of integers contains consecutive numbers. Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order, without any gaps. For example, the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is consecutive, but `[1, 3, 4, 5]` is not because there is a gap between 1 and 3.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To check if a list contains consecutive numbers, we can first sort the list. Then, we iterate through the sorted list and check if each number is exactly one more than the previous number. If we find any number that is not one more than the previous number, the list is not consecutive. If we reach the end of the list without finding any such number, the list is consecutive.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Sort the list of numbers.
   - Iterate through the sorted list from the first element to the second-to-last element.
     - For each element, check if the next element is exactly one more than the current element.
     - If any element does not satisfy this condition, return `False`.
   - If all elements satisfy the condition, return `True`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_Consecutive(lst: list) -> bool:
    # Step 1: Sort the list
    lst.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the sorted list
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        # Step 3: Check if the next element is exactly one more than the current element
        if lst[i] + 1 != lst[i + 1]:
            # If not, the list is not consecutive
            return False
    
    # Step 4: If all elements are consecutive, return True
    return True
```

This function sorts the list and checks for consecutive numbers by ensuring each number is followed by its successor. If any number is not followed by its successor, it returns `False`. If all numbers are consecutive, it returns `True`.
