    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the sum of all common divisors of two given numbers. A common divisor is a number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Identify all divisors for each of the two numbers.\n2. Find the common divisors between the two sets of divisors.\n3. Sum up these common divisors.\n4. Return the sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a helper function `find_divisors(n)` that returns a set of all divisors of `n`.\n   - Initialize an empty set `divisors`.\n   - Loop through numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n   - If `n` is divisible by the current number, add it to the `divisors` set.\n   - Return the `divisors` set.\n\n2. Define the main function `sum(a, b)`.\n   - Use `find_divisors` to get the divisors of `a` and `b`.\n   - Find the intersection of these two sets to get the common divisors.\n   - Calculate the sum of the common divisors.\n   - Return the sum.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors(n: int) -> set:\n    # Initialize an empty set to store divisors\n    divisors = set()\n    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # If i is a divisor of n, add it to the set\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n    return divisors\n\ndef sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Find divisors of both numbers\n    divisors_a = find_divisors(a)\n    divisors_b = find_divisors(b)\n    # Find common divisors by intersecting the two sets\n    common_divisors = divisors_a.intersection(divisors_b)\n    # Calculate the sum of the common divisors\n    return sum(common_divisors)\n```\n\nThis code defines a helper function to find divisors and uses it to find and sum the common divisors of two numbers.",
