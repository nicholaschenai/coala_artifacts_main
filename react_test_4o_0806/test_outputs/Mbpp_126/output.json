    "raw_msg": "I understand now that the function name must be `sum` as specified in the problem statement, despite the conflict with the built-in function. To resolve this, we can use a different approach to calculate the sum of common divisors without directly calling the built-in `sum` function within our `sum` function. Here's how we can do it:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors(n: int) -> set:\n    # Initialize an empty set to store divisors\n    divisors = set()\n    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # If i is a divisor of n, add it to the set\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n    return divisors\n\ndef sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Find divisors of both numbers\n    divisors_a = find_divisors(a)\n    divisors_b = find_divisors(b)\n    # Find common divisors by intersecting the two sets\n    common_divisors = divisors_a.intersection(divisors_b)\n    # Calculate the sum of the common divisors manually\n    total = 0\n    for divisor in common_divisors:\n        total += divisor\n    return total\n```\n\nIn this solution, we manually calculate the sum of the common divisors to avoid using the built-in `sum` function within our `sum` function. This should resolve the conflict and meet the problem requirements.",
