    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes two tuples as input and checks if each element in the second tuple is smaller than the corresponding element in the first tuple. If all elements in the second tuple are smaller than their corresponding elements in the first tuple, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.\n2. For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will check if the element from the second tuple is smaller than the element from the first tuple.\n3. If we find any element in the second tuple that is not smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple, we will return `False`.\n4. If we complete the iteration without finding any such element, we will return `True`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n    for each index i in range of length of tuple1:\n        if tuple2[i] is not smaller than tuple1[i]:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Check if the element in the second tuple is not smaller than the element in the first tuple\n        if tuple2[i] >= tuple1[i]:\n            # If any element in the second tuple is not smaller, return False\n            return False\n    # If all elements in the second tuple are smaller, return True\n    return True\n```",
