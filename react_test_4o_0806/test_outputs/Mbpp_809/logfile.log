You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/809 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes two tuples as input and checks if each element in the second tuple is smaller than the corresponding element in the first tuple. If all elements in the second tuple are smaller than their corresponding elements in the first tuple, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
2. For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will check if the element from the second tuple is smaller than the element from the first tuple.
3. If we find any element in the second tuple that is not smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple, we will return `False`.
4. If we complete the iteration without finding any such element, we will return `True`.

## Pseudocode

```
function check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):
    for each index i in range of length of tuple1:
        if tuple2[i] is not smaller than tuple1[i]:
            return False
    return True
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Check if the element in the second tuple is not smaller than the element in the first tuple
        if tuple2[i] >= tuple1[i]:
            # If any element in the second tuple is not smaller, return False
            return False
    # If all elements in the second tuple are smaller, return True
    return True
```
