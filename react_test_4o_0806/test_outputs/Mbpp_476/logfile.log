You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/476 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the smallest and largest numbers in that list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Identify the smallest number in the list.
2. Identify the largest number in the list.
3. Calculate the sum of these two numbers.
4. Return the calculated sum.

### Pseudocode

```
function big_sum(arr):
    smallest = find the minimum value in arr
    largest = find the maximum value in arr
    result = smallest + largest
    return result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def big_sum(arr):
    # Find the smallest number in the array
    smallest = min(arr)
    # Find the largest number in the array
    largest = max(arr)
    # Calculate the sum of the smallest and largest numbers
    result = smallest + largest
    # Return the result
    return result
```
