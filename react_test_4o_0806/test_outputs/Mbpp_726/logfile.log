You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/726 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input. The function should return a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. Specifically, for an input tuple `(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{N+1})`, the output should be a tuple `(t_1 * t_2, t_2 * t_3, ..., t_N * t_{N+1})`.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we will:
- Initialize an empty list to store the products of consecutive elements.
- Iterate over the input tuple, stopping one element before the last.
- For each element at index `i`, multiply it with the element at index `i+1`.
- Append the result of each multiplication to the list.
- Convert the list of products to a tuple and return it.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function multiply_elements(input_tuple):
    initialize an empty list called products
    for each index i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:
        calculate product of input_tuple[i] and input_tuple[i+1]
        append the product to products list
    convert products list to a tuple
    return the tuple
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def multiply_elements(input_tuple):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the products
    products = []
    
    # Iterate over the input tuple, stopping before the last element
    for i in range(len(input_tuple) - 1):
        # Calculate the product of the current element and the next element
        product = input_tuple[i] * input_tuple[i + 1]
        # Append the product to the products list
        products.append(product)
    
    # Convert the list of products to a tuple
    result_tuple = tuple(products)
    
    # Return the resulting tuple
    return result_tuple
```

This code will take a tuple of numbers as input and return a tuple of products of consecutive elements, as specified in the problem statement.
