The function should return the maximum value found in the `n`-th column of the matrix.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to ensure that the input matrix is not empty and that the column index `n` is valid for the given matrix.\n   - We will iterate over each row of the matrix and collect the element at the `n`-th index of each row.\n   - We will then find the maximum value from these collected elements.\n   - Finally, we will return this maximum value.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function max_of_nth(matrix, n):\n       Initialize an empty list called column_values\n       For each row in the matrix:\n           Append the element at index n of the row to column_values\n       Return the maximum value from column_values\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_of_nth(matrix, n):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the values of the n-th column\n    column_values = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each row in the matrix\n    for row in matrix:\n        # Append the n-th element of the current row to column_values\n        column_values.append(row[n])\n    \n    # Return the maximum value from the collected n-th column values\n    return max(column_values)\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each row of the matrix, extracts the `n`-th element, and finds the maximum value among these elements. The function assumes that the input matrix is well-formed and that the column index `n` is valid for all rows."
