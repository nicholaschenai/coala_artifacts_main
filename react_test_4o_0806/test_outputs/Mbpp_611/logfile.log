You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/611 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n` as inputs. The function should return the maximum value found in the `n`-th column of the matrix.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, we need to ensure that the input matrix is not empty and that the column index `n` is valid for the given matrix.
   - We will iterate over each row of the matrix and collect the element at the `n`-th index of each row.
   - We will then find the maximum value from these collected elements.
   - Finally, we will return this maximum value.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function max_of_nth(matrix, n):
       Initialize an empty list called column_values
       For each row in the matrix:
           Append the element at index n of the row to column_values
       Return the maximum value from column_values
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def max_of_nth(matrix, n):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the values of the n-th column
    column_values = []
    
    # Iterate over each row in the matrix
    for row in matrix:
        # Append the n-th element of the current row to column_values
        column_values.append(row[n])
    
    # Return the maximum value from the collected n-th column values
    return max(column_values)
```

This solution iterates over each row of the matrix, extracts the `n`-th element, and finds the maximum value among these elements. The function assumes that the input matrix is well-formed and that the column index `n` is valid for all rows.

        # Append the n-th element of the current row to column_values
        column_values.append(row[n])
    
    # Return the maximum value from the collected n-th column values

        column_values.append(row[n])
    
    # Return the maximum value from the collected n-th column values
    return max(column_values)
```
