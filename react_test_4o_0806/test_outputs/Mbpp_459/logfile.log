You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/459 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to create a function that takes a string as input and removes all contiguous sequences of uppercase letters from it. The result should be a string that only contains the lowercase letters and any other characters that were not part of an uppercase sequence.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string character by character. We will keep track of whether we are currently in an uppercase sequence. If we encounter an uppercase letter, we will skip it and continue skipping until we find a non-uppercase letter. If we encounter a non-uppercase letter, we will add it to our result string. This way, we effectively remove all uppercase substrings.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the final output.
2. Initialize a boolean variable `in_uppercase` to `False` to track if we are in an uppercase sequence.
3. Iterate over each character `char` in the input string:
   - If `char` is an uppercase letter:
     - Set `in_uppercase` to `True`.
   - Else (if `char` is not an uppercase letter):
     - If `in_uppercase` is `True`, set it to `False` (indicating the end of an uppercase sequence).
     - Append `char` to `result`.
4. Return the `result` string.

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def remove_uppercase(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to store the result
    result = ""
    # Boolean flag to track if we are in an uppercase sequence
    in_uppercase = False
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is uppercase
        if char.isupper():
            # If it is uppercase, set the flag to True
            in_uppercase = True
        else:
            # If it is not uppercase and we were in an uppercase sequence
            if in_uppercase:
                # Set the flag to False as we are exiting the uppercase sequence
                in_uppercase = False
            # Append the non-uppercase character to the result
            result += char
    
    # Return the final result string
    return result
```

This code will correctly remove all uppercase substrings from the input string, as specified in the problem statement.
