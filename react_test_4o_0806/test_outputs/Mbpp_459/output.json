    "raw_msg": "Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.\n\n### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a string as input and removes all contiguous sequences of uppercase letters from it. The result should be a string that only contains the lowercase letters and any other characters that were not part of an uppercase sequence.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can iterate through the string character by character. We will keep track of whether we are currently in an uppercase sequence. If we encounter an uppercase letter, we will skip it and continue skipping until we find a non-uppercase letter. If we encounter a non-uppercase letter, we will add it to our result string. This way, we effectively remove all uppercase substrings.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the final output.\n2. Initialize a boolean variable `in_uppercase` to `False` to track if we are in an uppercase sequence.\n3. Iterate over each character `char` in the input string:\n   - If `char` is an uppercase letter:\n     - Set `in_uppercase` to `True`.\n   - Else (if `char` is not an uppercase letter):\n     - If `in_uppercase` is `True`, set it to `False` (indicating the end of an uppercase sequence).\n     - Append `char` to `result`.\n4. Return the `result` string.\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef remove_uppercase(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n    # Boolean flag to track if we are in an uppercase sequence\n    in_uppercase = False\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is uppercase\n        if char.isupper():\n            # If it is uppercase, set the flag to True\n            in_uppercase = True\n        else:\n            # If it is not uppercase and we were in an uppercase sequence\n            if in_uppercase:\n                # Set the flag to False as we are exiting the uppercase sequence\n                in_uppercase = False\n            # Append the non-uppercase character to the result\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the final result string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code will correctly remove all uppercase substrings from the input string, as specified in the problem statement.",
