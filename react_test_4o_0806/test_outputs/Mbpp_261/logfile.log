You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/261 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples of numbers as input and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain the result of dividing each element of the first tuple by the corresponding element in the second tuple.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will perform division.
   - We will store the result of each division in a new tuple.
   - Finally, we will return this new tuple containing all the division results.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `division_elements` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
   - Initialize an empty list `result`.
   - Loop over the indices of the tuples (assuming both tuples are of the same length):
     - Divide the element at the current index of `tuple1` by the element at the same index of `tuple2`.
     - Append the result of the division to the `result` list.
   - Convert the `result` list to a tuple.
   - Return the resulting tuple.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def division_elements(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of division
    result = []
    
    # Loop over the indices of the tuples
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Perform division of the elements at the current index
        division_result = tuple1[i] // tuple2[i]
        # Append the result to the result list
        result.append(division_result)
    
    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
```

This code will correctly perform element-wise division of the two input tuples and return the results as a new tuple.

    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Perform division of the elements at the current index

        # Append the result to the result list
        result.append(division_result)
    
    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)

```python
def division_elements(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of division
    result = []
    
    # Loop over the indices of the tuples
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Perform division of the elements at the current index
        division_result = tuple1[i] // tuple2[i]
        # Append the result to the result list
        result.append(division_result)
    
    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
```

This code will correctly perform element-wise division of the two input tuples and return the results as a new tuple.
