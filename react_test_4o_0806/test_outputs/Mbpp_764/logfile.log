You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/764 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that counts the number of digit characters in a given string. A digit character is any character from '0' to '9'.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a counter to zero. This counter will keep track of the number of digit characters in the string.
2. Iterate over each character in the string.
3. For each character, check if it is a digit.
4. If the character is a digit, increment the counter by one.
5. After iterating through the entire string, return the counter value, which represents the number of digit characters in the string.

## Pseudocode

```
function number_ctr(s):
    initialize counter to 0
    for each character in string s:
        if character is a digit:
            increment counter by 1
    return counter
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def number_ctr(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of digits
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is a digit
        if char.isdigit():
            # Increment the counter if it is a digit
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of digit characters
    return count
```
