A digit character is any character from '0' to '9'.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize a counter to zero. This counter will keep track of the number of digit characters in the string.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string.\n3. For each character, check if it is a digit.\n4. If the character is a digit, increment the counter by one.\n5. After iterating through the entire string, return the counter value, which represents the number of digit characters in the string.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction number_ctr(s):\n    initialize counter to 0\n    for each character in string s:\n        if character is a digit:\n            increment counter by 1\n    return counter\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef number_ctr(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of digits\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is a digit\n        if char.isdigit():\n            # Increment the counter if it is a digit\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of digit characters\n    return count\n```"
