        "content": "Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.\n\n### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to write a function that determines whether a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo determine if a number is prime:\n- If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.\n- If the number is 2, it is prime because 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.\n- For numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.\n- If no divisors are found, the number is prime.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction prime_num(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    if n is even:\n        return False\n    for i from 3 to sqrt(n) with step 2:\n        if n is divisible by i:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef prime_num(n: int) -> bool:\n    # If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    # 2 is the only even prime number\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    # If the number is even and greater than 2, it is not prime\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    # Check for factors from 3 to the square root of n\n    # Only check odd numbers since even numbers are not prime\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    # If no factors were found, the number is prime\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function efficiently checks if a number is prime by reducing the number of potential divisors it needs to check, leveraging the properties of prime numbers."
