You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/763 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the smallest difference between any two numbers in a given list of integers. The function should take a tuple of integers and the number of elements in the tuple as inputs and return the minimum difference.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, sort the list of numbers. Sorting helps because the smallest difference between any two numbers will be between two consecutive numbers in a sorted list.
   - Initialize a variable to store the minimum difference, starting with a large value (like infinity).
   - Iterate through the sorted list and calculate the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers.
   - If the calculated difference is smaller than the current minimum difference, update the minimum difference.
   - After checking all consecutive pairs, return the minimum difference found.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_min_diff(arr, n):
       sort the array
       set min_diff to a large number (infinity)
       for i from 0 to n-2:
           calculate diff as arr[i+1] - arr[i]
           if diff < min_diff:
               update min_diff to diff
       return min_diff
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_min_diff(arr: tuple, n: int) -> int:
    # Convert the tuple to a list and sort it
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
    
    # Initialize the minimum difference to a large number
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the minimum difference
    for i in range(n - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between consecutive elements
        diff = sorted_arr[i + 1] - sorted_arr[i]
        
        # Update the minimum difference if a smaller one is found
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    
    # Return the smallest difference found
    return min_diff
```

This solution sorts the array and then checks the difference between each pair of consecutive elements to find the minimum difference, which is efficient and straightforward.
