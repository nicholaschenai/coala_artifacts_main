However, it does not preserve the order of elements as they appear in the first list, which is required by the problem statement.\n\n2. **Where the solution went wrong:**\n   - The solution correctly identifies elements that are in the first list but not in the second list. However, it does not account for the order of elements in the first list that are not in the second list. The expected output `[10, 20, 30, 15]` suggests that the order of elements in the first list should be preserved in the result.\n\n### Corrected Conceptual Solution\n\n- We need to ensure that the order of elements in the result list matches the order in which they appear in the first list.\n- The current logic of checking if an element is not in the second list is correct, but we need to ensure that the order of elements in the result list is the same as their order in the first list.\n\n### Corrected Pseudocode\n\n```\nDefine a function Diff that takes two lists, list1 and list2\n    Initialize an empty list called result\n    For each element in list1\n        If the element is not in list2\n            Append the element to result\n    Return the result list\n```\n\n### Corrected Python Solution\n\nThe original solution already preserves the order of elements as they appear in the first list. The issue might be with the test case or the understanding of the expected output. Let's ensure the function is correct:\n\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not, append it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the result list containing elements only in list1\n    return result\n```\n\nThe function should work correctly as per the problem statement.
