        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius. If the radius is negative, the function should return `None`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: \n   - A semicircle is half of a circle. The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle with its hypotenuse as the diameter of the semicircle.\n   - The diameter of the semicircle is twice the radius (`2 * radius`).\n\n2. **Triangle Properties**:\n   - For a right triangle inscribed in a semicircle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the semicircle.\n   - The maximum area of such a triangle is achieved when the triangle is isosceles, meaning the two legs are equal in length.\n\n3. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area of a triangle is given by the formula: \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\).\n   - For the largest inscribed triangle, the base and height are both equal to the radius of the semicircle.\n   - Therefore, the area of the largest triangle is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{radius} \\times \\text{radius} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{radius}^2 \\).\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**:\n   - If the radius is negative, the function should return `None` because a negative radius does not make sense in this context.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction triangle_area(radius):\n    if radius is negative:\n        return None\n    else:\n        calculate area as (1/2) * radius * radius\n        return the calculated area\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef triangle_area(radius: float) -> float:\n    # If the radius is negative, return None\n    if radius < 0:\n        return None\n    # Calculate the area of the largest inscribed triangle\n    # Area = (1/2) * radius * radius\n    area = 0.5 * radius * radius\n    return area\n```"
