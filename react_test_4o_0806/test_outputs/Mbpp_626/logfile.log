INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/626 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius. If the radius is negative, the function should return `None`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Geometry**: 
   - A semicircle is half of a circle. The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle with its hypotenuse as the diameter of the semicircle.
   - The diameter of the semicircle is twice the radius (`2 * radius`).

2. **Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right triangle inscribed in a semicircle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the semicircle.
   - The maximum area of such a triangle is achieved when the triangle is isosceles, meaning the two legs are equal in length.

3. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of a triangle is given by the formula: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
   - For the largest inscribed triangle, the base and height are both equal to the radius of the semicircle.
   - Therefore, the area of the largest triangle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{radius} \times \text{radius} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{radius}^2 \).

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the radius is negative, the function should return `None` because a negative radius does not make sense in this context.

## Pseudocode

```
function triangle_area(radius):
    if radius is negative:
        return None
    else:
        calculate area as (1/2) * radius * radius
        return the calculated area
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def triangle_area(radius: float) -> float:
    # If the radius is negative, return None
    if radius < 0:
        return None
    # Calculate the area of the largest inscribed triangle
    # Area = (1/2) * radius * radius
    area = 0.5 * radius * radius
    return area
```
