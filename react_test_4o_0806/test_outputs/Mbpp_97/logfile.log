You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/97 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input, flattens it into a single list, and then counts the frequency of each element in this flattened list. The result should be returned as a dictionary where the keys are the elements and the values are their respective frequencies.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, we need to flatten the list of lists into a single list. This means we take all the elements from each sublist and combine them into one list.
   - Next, we will create a dictionary to store the frequency of each element. We will iterate over the flattened list and for each element, we will either add it to the dictionary with a count of 1 (if it's not already there) or increment its count by 1 (if it is already there).
   - Finally, we will return the dictionary containing the frequencies of all elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function frequency_lists with parameter list_of_lists
       Initialize an empty list called flattened_list
       For each sublist in list_of_lists
           Extend flattened_list with elements from sublist
       Initialize an empty dictionary called frequency_dict
       For each element in flattened_list
           If element is not in frequency_dict
               Add element to frequency_dict with value 1
           Else
               Increment the value of element in frequency_dict by 1
       Return frequency_dict
   ```

def frequency_lists(list_of_lists):
