    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input, flattens it into a single list, and then counts the frequency of each element in this flattened list. The result should be returned as a dictionary where the keys are the elements and the values are their respective frequencies.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, we need to flatten the list of lists into a single list. This means we take all the elements from each sublist and combine them into one list.\n   - Next, we will create a dictionary to store the frequency of each element. We will iterate over the flattened list and for each element, we will either add it to the dictionary with a count of 1 (if it's not already there) or increment its count by 1 (if it is already there).\n   - Finally, we will return the dictionary containing the frequencies of all elements.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function frequency_lists with parameter list_of_lists\n       Initialize an empty list called flattened_list\n       For each sublist in list_of_lists\n           Extend flattened_list with elements from sublist\n       Initialize an empty dictionary called frequency_dict\n       For each element in flattened_list\n           If element is not in frequency_dict\n               Add element to frequency_dict with value 1\n           Else\n               Increment the value of element in frequency_dict by 1\n       Return frequency_dict\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef frequency_lists(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store all elements from the sublists\n    flattened_list = []\n    \n    # Flatten the list of lists into a single list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        flattened_list.extend(sublist)\n    \n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each element in the flattened list\n    for element in flattened_list:\n        if element not in frequency_dict:\n            # If the element is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n            frequency_dict[element] = 1\n        else:\n            # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n            frequency_dict[element] += 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing the frequencies\n    return frequency_dict\n```",
