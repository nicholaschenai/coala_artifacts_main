You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/737 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that checks if a given string starts with a vowel. The function should use regular expressions to perform this check.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will use a regular expression to determine if the first character of the string is a vowel.
   - Vowels in the English language are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and we will consider both uppercase and lowercase vowels.
   - The regular expression pattern will be designed to match any of these vowels at the start of the string.
   - If the string starts with a vowel, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `check_str` that takes a single argument `s`.
   - Use a regular expression to check if the string `s` starts with a vowel.
     - The pattern should match any of the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') at the beginning of the string.
     - Use the `re.match` function to apply this pattern to the string.
   - If the match is found, return `True`.
   - If no match is found, return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
import re

def check_str(s: str) -> bool:
    # Define a regular expression pattern to match a vowel at the start of the string.
    # The pattern '^[aeiouAEIOU]' means:
    # '^' asserts the position at the start of the string.
    # '[aeiouAEIOU]' matches any single character that is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase).
    pattern = r'^[aeiouAEIOU]'
    
    # Use re.match to check if the string starts with a vowel.
    # re.match returns a match object if the pattern is found at the start of the string, otherwise None.
    if re.match(pattern, s):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This code defines the function `check_str` which uses a regular expression to determine if the input string starts with a vowel. The function returns `True` if it does, and `False` otherwise.
