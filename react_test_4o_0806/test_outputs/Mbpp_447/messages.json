We will iterate over each element in the input list.\n2. For each element, we will calculate its cube (i.e., raise it to the power of 3).\n3. We will store each cubed value in a new list.\n4. Finally, we will return the new list containing all the cubed values.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction cube_nums(nums):\n    create an empty list called cubed_list\n    for each number in nums:\n        calculate the cube of the number\n        append the cubed value to cubed_list\n    return cubed_list\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef cube_nums(nums):\n    # Create an empty list to store the cubed values\n    cubed_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the input list\n    for num in nums:\n        # Calculate the cube of the current number\n        cubed_value = num ** 3\n        \n        # Append the cubed value to the cubed_list\n        cubed_list.append(cubed_value)\n    \n    # Return the list of cubed values\n    return cubed_list\n```"
