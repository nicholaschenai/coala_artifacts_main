You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/447 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is the cube of the corresponding element in the input list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate over each element in the input list.
2. For each element, we will calculate its cube (i.e., raise it to the power of 3).
3. We will store each cubed value in a new list.
4. Finally, we will return the new list containing all the cubed values.

## Pseudocode

```
function cube_nums(nums):
    create an empty list called cubed_list
    for each number in nums:
        calculate the cube of the number
        append the cubed value to cubed_list
    return cubed_list
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def cube_nums(nums):
    # Create an empty list to store the cubed values
    cubed_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # Calculate the cube of the current number
        cubed_value = num ** 3
        
        # Append the cubed value to the cubed_list
        cubed_list.append(cubed_value)
    
    # Return the list of cubed values
    return cubed_list
