This new string should only contain the characters from the original string that are located at even index positions (0, 2, 4, etc.).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - To solve this problem, we can iterate over the string using a loop. For each character in the string, we check its index. If the index is even, we add the character to a new string. Finally, we return this new string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Initialize an empty string to store the result.\n   - Loop through the original string using an index.\n   - For each character, check if the index is even.\n   - If the index is even, append the character to the result string.\n   - After the loop, return the result string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_values_string(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through the string using an index\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Check if the index is even\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # Append the character at the even index to the result string\n            result += s[i]\n    \n    # Return the result string containing characters at even indices\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each character in the input string, checks if the index is even, and constructs a new string with only those characters. The final result is returned."
