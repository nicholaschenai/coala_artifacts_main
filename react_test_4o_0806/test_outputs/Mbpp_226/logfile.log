You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""
Write a python function to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string.
assert odd_values_string('abcdef') == 'ace'
"""

[END PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/226 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string. This new string should only contain the characters from the original string that are located at even index positions (0, 2, 4, etc.).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To solve this problem, we can iterate over the string using a loop. For each character in the string, we check its index. If the index is even, we add the character to a new string. Finally, we return this new string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Initialize an empty string to store the result.
   - Loop through the original string using an index.
   - For each character, check if the index is even.
   - If the index is even, append the character to the result string.
   - After the loop, return the result string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def odd_values_string(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to store the result
    result = ""
    
    # Loop through the string using an index
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Check if the index is even
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # Append the character at the even index to the result string
            result += s[i]
    
    # Return the result string containing characters at even indices
    return result
```

This function iterates over each character in the input string, checks if the index is even, and constructs a new string with only those characters. The final result is returned.
