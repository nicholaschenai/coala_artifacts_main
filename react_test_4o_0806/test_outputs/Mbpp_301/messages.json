        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that calculates the depth of a nested dictionary. The depth is defined as the number of levels of nested dictionaries. For example, a dictionary with no nested dictionaries has a depth of 1, and a dictionary with one level of nested dictionaries has a depth of 2, and so on.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will create a recursive function to determine the depth of the dictionary.\n   - The base case will be when the dictionary is empty or has no nested dictionaries, in which case the depth is 1.\n   - For each key in the dictionary, if the value is another dictionary, we will recursively calculate the depth of that dictionary.\n   - We will keep track of the maximum depth encountered among all the nested dictionaries.\n   - The depth of the current dictionary will be 1 plus the maximum depth of its nested dictionaries.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function dict_depth(d):\n       if d is not a dictionary or is empty:\n           return 1\n       max_depth = 1\n       for each key, value in d:\n           if value is a dictionary:\n               depth = dict_depth(value)\n               max_depth = max(max_depth, depth + 1)\n       return max_depth\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef dict_depth(d):\n    # Base case: if the input is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary\n    if not isinstance(d, dict) or not d:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the maximum depth to 1 (the current level)\n    max_depth = 1\n    \n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary\n    for key, value in d.items():\n        # If the value is a dictionary, calculate its depth recursively\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            # Calculate the depth of the nested dictionary\n            depth = dict_depth(value)\n            # Update the maximum depth encountered\n            max_depth = max(max_depth, depth + 1)\n    \n    # Return the maximum depth found\n    return max_depth\n```\n\nThis solution uses recursion to explore each level of nested dictionaries and keeps track of the maximum depth encountered. The base case ensures that even an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary input returns a depth of 1."
