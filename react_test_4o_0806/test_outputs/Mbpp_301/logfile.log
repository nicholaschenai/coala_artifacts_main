You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/301 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the depth of a nested dictionary. The depth is defined as the number of levels of nested dictionaries. For example, a dictionary with no nested dictionaries has a depth of 1, and a dictionary with one level of nested dictionaries has a depth of 2, and so on.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will create a recursive function to determine the depth of the dictionary.
   - The base case will be when the dictionary is empty or has no nested dictionaries, in which case the depth is 1.
   - For each key in the dictionary, if the value is another dictionary, we will recursively calculate the depth of that dictionary.
   - We will keep track of the maximum depth encountered among all the nested dictionaries.
   - The depth of the current dictionary will be 1 plus the maximum depth of its nested dictionaries.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function dict_depth(d):
       if d is not a dictionary or is empty:
           return 1
       max_depth = 1
       for each key, value in d:
           if value is a dictionary:
               depth = dict_depth(value)
               max_depth = max(max_depth, depth + 1)
       return max_depth
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def dict_depth(d):
    # Base case: if the input is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary
    if not isinstance(d, dict) or not d:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the maximum depth to 1 (the current level)
    max_depth = 1
    
    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary
    for key, value in d.items():
        # If the value is a dictionary, calculate its depth recursively
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            # Calculate the depth of the nested dictionary
            depth = dict_depth(value)
            # Update the maximum depth encountered
            max_depth = max(max_depth, depth + 1)
    
    # Return the maximum depth found
    return max_depth
```

This solution uses recursion to explore each level of nested dictionaries and keeps track of the maximum depth encountered. The base case ensures that even an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary input returns a depth of 1.

            depth = dict_depth(value)
            # Update the maximum depth encountered
            max_depth = max(max_depth, depth + 1)

    # Return the maximum depth found
    return max_depth
```
