A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero).\n   - If a number is odd, we will add it to a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return the new list containing only the odd numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `filter_oddnumbers` that takes a list `numbers` as input.\n   - Initialize an empty list `odd_numbers`.\n   - For each `number` in `numbers`:\n     - If `number` is odd (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`):\n       - Append `number` to `odd_numbers`.\n   - Return `odd_numbers`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef filter_oddnumbers(numbers):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store odd numbers\n    odd_numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            # If it is odd, append it to the odd_numbers list\n            odd_numbers.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of odd numbers\n    return odd_numbers\n```\n\nThis function will correctly filter out the odd numbers from the input list and return them as a new list."
