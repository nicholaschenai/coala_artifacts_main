    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to find the largest products that can be formed by multiplying one number from each of two given lists. The function should return a specified number of these largest products in descending order.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, we need to generate all possible products by multiplying each element from the first list with each element from the second list.\n   - Then, we sort these products in descending order.\n   - Finally, we select the top 'n' products from this sorted list, where 'n' is the specified number of largest products we need to return.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Initialize an empty list to store the products.\n   - For each element in the first list:\n     - For each element in the second list:\n       - Calculate the product of the two elements.\n       - Append the product to the list of products.\n   - Sort the list of products in descending order.\n   - Return the first 'n' elements from the sorted list.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef large_product(list1, list2, n):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the products\n    products = []\n    \n    # Generate all possible products\n    for num1 in list1:\n        for num2 in list2:\n            # Calculate the product and append to the list\n            products.append(num1 * num2)\n    \n    # Sort the products in descending order\n    products.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Return the first 'n' elements from the sorted list\n    return products[:n]\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates all possible products, sorts them, and retrieves the largest 'n' products as required.",
