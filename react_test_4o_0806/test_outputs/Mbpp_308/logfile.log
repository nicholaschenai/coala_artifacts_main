You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/308 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to find the largest products that can be formed by multiplying one number from each of two given lists. The function should return a specified number of these largest products in descending order.

### Conceptual Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, we need to generate all possible products by multiplying each element from the first list with each element from the second list.
   - Then, we sort these products in descending order.
   - Finally, we select the top 'n' products from this sorted list, where 'n' is the specified number of largest products we need to return.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Initialize an empty list to store the products.
   - For each element in the first list:
     - For each element in the second list:
       - Calculate the product of the two elements.
       - Append the product to the list of products.
   - Sort the list of products in descending order.
   - Return the first 'n' elements from the sorted list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def large_product(list1, list2, n):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the products
    products = []
    
    # Generate all possible products
    for num1 in list1:
        for num2 in list2:
            # Calculate the product and append to the list
            products.append(num1 * num2)
    
    # Sort the products in descending order
    products.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Return the first 'n' elements from the sorted list
    return products[:n]
```

This solution efficiently calculates all possible products, sorts them, and retrieves the largest 'n' products as required.
