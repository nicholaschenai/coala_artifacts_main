You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/230 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a string and a character as inputs. The function should replace all blank spaces in the string with the given character and return the modified string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We can solve this problem by iterating over the string and checking each character. If a character is a blank space, we replace it with the specified character. We can use Python's built-in string method `replace` to achieve this efficiently.

3. **Pseudocode Solution:**
   - Define a function `replace_blank` that takes two parameters: `input_string` and `replacement_char`.
   - Use the `replace` method of the string to replace all occurrences of the space character `' '` with `replacement_char`.
   - Return the modified string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def replace_blank(input_string: str, replacement_char: str) -> str:
    # Use the replace method to replace all spaces with the replacement character
    modified_string = input_string.replace(' ', replacement_char)
    # Return the modified string
    return modified_string
```

This solution uses the `replace` method, which is a straightforward and efficient way to replace all occurrences of a specified substring (in this case, a space) with another substring (the replacement character).

    return modified_string
