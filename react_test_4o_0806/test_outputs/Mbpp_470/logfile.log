You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/470 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain the sums of each pair of consecutive elements from the input tuple.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we will:
- Iterate through the input tuple, stopping one element before the end.
- For each element, add it to the next element in the tuple.
- Store each sum in a new list.
- Convert the list of sums into a tuple and return it.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function add_pairwise(input_tuple):
    initialize an empty list called result
    for each index i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:
        calculate the sum of input_tuple[i] and input_tuple[i + 1]
        append the sum to the result list
    convert the result list to a tuple
    return the result tuple
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def add_pairwise(input_tuple):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sums
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the tuple, stopping before the last element
    for i in range(len(input_tuple) - 1):
        # Calculate the sum of the current element and the next element
        pair_sum = input_tuple[i] + input_tuple[i + 1]
        # Append the sum to the result list
        result.append(pair_sum)
    
    # Convert the list of sums to a tuple
    result_tuple = tuple(result)
    
    # Return the resulting tuple
    return result_tuple
```

This code will correctly compute the pairwise sums of neighboring elements in the input tuple and return them as a new tuple.

        # Append the sum to the result list
        result.append(pair_sum)
    
    # Convert the list of sums to a tuple
