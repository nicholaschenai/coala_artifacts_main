You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/137 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in a given list of integers. The function should return this ratio as a floating-point number.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Count Zeroes**: Traverse the list and count how many elements are zero.
2. **Count Non-Zeroes**: Calculate the number of non-zero elements by subtracting the count of zeroes from the total number of elements in the list.
3. **Calculate Ratio**: Compute the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes. If there are no non-zero elements, handle this case to avoid division by zero.
4. **Return the Ratio**: Return the calculated ratio as a floating-point number.

### Pseudocode

```
function zero_count(arr):
    zero_count = 0
    for each element in arr:
        if element is zero:
            increment zero_count
    non_zero_count = length of arr - zero_count
    if non_zero_count is zero:
        return 0.0
    else:
        return zero_count / non_zero_count
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def zero_count(arr):
    # Initialize the count of zeroes
    zero_count = 0
    
    # Count the number of zeroes in the array
    for num in arr:
        if num == 0:
            zero_count += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of non-zero elements
    non_zero_count = len(arr) - zero_count
    
    # If there are no non-zero elements, return 0.0 to avoid division by zero
    if non_zero_count == 0:
        return 0.0
    
    # Calculate and return the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes
    return zero_count / non_zero_count
```

This solution iterates through the list to count zeroes, calculates the number of non-zero elements, and then computes the ratio. It handles the edge case where there are no non-zero elements by returning 0.0.
