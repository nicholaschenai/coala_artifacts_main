        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in a given list of integers. The function should return this ratio as a floating-point number.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Count Zeroes**: Traverse the list and count how many elements are zero.\n2. **Count Non-Zeroes**: Calculate the number of non-zero elements by subtracting the count of zeroes from the total number of elements in the list.\n3. **Calculate Ratio**: Compute the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes. If there are no non-zero elements, handle this case to avoid division by zero.\n4. **Return the Ratio**: Return the calculated ratio as a floating-point number.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction zero_count(arr):\n    zero_count = 0\n    for each element in arr:\n        if element is zero:\n            increment zero_count\n    non_zero_count = length of arr - zero_count\n    if non_zero_count is zero:\n        return 0.0\n    else:\n        return zero_count / non_zero_count\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef zero_count(arr):\n    # Initialize the count of zeroes\n    zero_count = 0\n    \n    # Count the number of zeroes in the array\n    for num in arr:\n        if num == 0:\n            zero_count += 1\n    \n    # Calculate the number of non-zero elements\n    non_zero_count = len(arr) - zero_count\n    \n    # If there are no non-zero elements, return 0.0 to avoid division by zero\n    if non_zero_count == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    # Calculate and return the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes\n    return zero_count / non_zero_count\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list to count zeroes, calculates the number of non-zero elements, and then computes the ratio. It handles the edge case where there are no non-zero elements by returning 0.0."
