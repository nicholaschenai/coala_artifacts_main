You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.
"""

2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/424 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each string in the input tuple.
   - For each string, we will extract the last character.
   - We will collect these last characters into a list.
   - Finally, we will return this list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `extract_rear` that takes a tuple of strings as input.
   - Initialize an empty list `rear_characters`.
   - For each string in the tuple:
     - Get the last character of the string.
     - Append this character to `rear_characters`.
   - Return the `rear_characters` list.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def extract_rear(strings: tuple) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the last characters
    rear_characters = []
    
    # Iterate over each string in the input tuple
    for string in strings:
        # Append the last character of the current string to the list
        rear_characters.append(string[-1])
    
    # Return the list of last characters
    return rear_characters
```

This solution iterates over each string in the tuple, extracts the last character, and appends it to a list, which is then returned. This approach ensures that we correctly gather the last character from each string in the input tuple.

        # Append the last character of the current string to the list

    # Return the list of last characters
