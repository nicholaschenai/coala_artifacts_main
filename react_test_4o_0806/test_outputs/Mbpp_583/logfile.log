INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/583 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the nth Catalan number. The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics. The nth Catalan number can be calculated using the formula:

\[ C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!} \]

where \( n! \) denotes the factorial of n.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Formula**: The nth Catalan number is given by the formula \[ C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!} \]. This formula involves factorials, which are the product of all positive integers up to a given number.

2. **Calculate Factorials**: To compute the nth Catalan number, we need to calculate the factorials of \( 2n \), \( n+1 \), and \( n \).

3. **Compute the Catalan Number**: Use the formula to compute the Catalan number by dividing the factorial of \( 2n \) by the product of the factorials of \( n+1 \) and \( n \).

4. **Return the Result**: Return the computed Catalan number.

### Pseudocode

```
function factorial(n):
    if n is 0 or 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

function catalan_number(n):
    factorial_2n = factorial(2 * n)
    factorial_n1 = factorial(n + 1)
    factorial_n = factorial(n)
    catalan_n = factorial_2n // (factorial_n1 * factorial_n)
    return catalan_n
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
# Helper function to calculate factorial of a number
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Main function to calculate the nth Catalan number
def catalan_number(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate factorial of 2n
    factorial_2n = factorial(2 * n)
    # Calculate factorial of n+1
    factorial_n1 = factorial(n + 1)
    # Calculate factorial of n
    factorial_n = factorial(n)
    # Calculate the nth Catalan number using the formula
    catalan_n = factorial_2n // (factorial_n1 * factorial_n)
    # Return the result
    return catalan_n
```

This solution uses a recursive approach to calculate factorials and then applies the formula for the Catalan number. The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the result is an integer, as expected for Catalan numbers.
