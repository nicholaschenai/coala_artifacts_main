The function should return the new integer value after this modification.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Convert the integer to its binary representation.\n   - Identify the leftmost unset bit (0) in this binary representation.\n   - Change this leftmost unset bit to 1.\n   - Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer.\n   - Return the resulting integer.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Convert the integer to binary.\n   - Iterate over the bits from left to right.\n   - Find the first occurrence of a 0.\n   - Set this 0 to 1.\n   - Convert the modified binary back to an integer.\n   - Return the integer.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n: int) -> int:\n    # Convert the number to binary string\n    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]  # Remove the '0b' prefix\n    \n    # Find the leftmost unset bit (0)\n    for i in range(len(binary_str)):\n        if binary_str[i] == '0':\n            # Set the leftmost unset bit to 1\n            # Create a new binary string with the bit set\n            new_binary_str = binary_str[:i] + '1' + binary_str[i+1:]\n            # Convert the new binary string back to an integer\n            return int(new_binary_str, 2)\n    \n    # If no unset bit is found, it means all bits are set\n    # In this case, append a '1' to the left of the binary string\n    new_binary_str = '1' + binary_str\n    return int(new_binary_str, 2)\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over the binary representation of the number to find the first unset bit, sets it, and then converts the modified binary string back to an integer. If all bits are set, it appends a '1' to the left, effectively increasing the number by a power of two."
