You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/311 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and sets the leftmost unset (0) bit in its binary representation to 1. The function should return the new integer value after this modification.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Convert the integer to its binary representation.
   - Identify the leftmost unset bit (0) in this binary representation.
   - Change this leftmost unset bit to 1.
   - Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer.
   - Return the resulting integer.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Convert the integer to binary.
   - Iterate over the bits from left to right.
   - Find the first occurrence of a 0.
   - Set this 0 to 1.
   - Convert the modified binary back to an integer.
   - Return the integer.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def set_left_most_unset_bit(n: int) -> int:
    # Convert the number to binary string
    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]  # Remove the '0b' prefix
    
    # Find the leftmost unset bit (0)
    for i in range(len(binary_str)):
        if binary_str[i] == '0':
            # Set the leftmost unset bit to 1
            # Create a new binary string with the bit set
            new_binary_str = binary_str[:i] + '1' + binary_str[i+1:]
            # Convert the new binary string back to an integer
            return int(new_binary_str, 2)
    
    # If no unset bit is found, it means all bits are set
    # In this case, append a '1' to the left of the binary string
    new_binary_str = '1' + binary_str
    return int(new_binary_str, 2)
```

This solution iterates over the binary representation of the number to find the first unset bit, sets it, and then converts the modified binary string back to an integer. If all bits are set, it appends a '1' to the left, effectively increasing the number by a power of two.
