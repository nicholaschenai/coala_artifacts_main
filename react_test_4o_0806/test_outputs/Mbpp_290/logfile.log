You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/290 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple should be the length of the longest list, and the second element should be the longest list itself. If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, we can return any one of them.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found so far, starting with zero.
   - Initialize another variable to store the list with the maximum length.
   - Iterate over each list in the input list of lists.
   - For each list, check its length.
   - If the length of the current list is greater than the maximum length found so far, update the maximum length and store the current list as the longest list.
   - After iterating through all lists, return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function max_length(list_of_lists):
       max_len = 0
       longest_list = []
       
       for each list in list_of_lists:
           if length of list > max_len:
               max_len = length of list
               longest_list = list
       
       return (max_len, longest_list)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def max_length(list_of_lists):
    # Initialize the maximum length to zero
    max_len = 0
    # Initialize the longest list as an empty list
    longest_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        # Check if the current list's length is greater than the current maximum length
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            # Update the maximum length
            max_len = len(lst)
            # Update the longest list
            longest_list = lst
    
    # Return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list
    return (max_len, longest_list)
```

This code will correctly find and return the longest list and its length from a list of lists.

        if len(lst) > max_len:
            # Update the maximum length
            max_len = len(lst)
            # Update the longest list
            longest_list = lst
    
    # Return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list
    return (max_len, longest_list)
