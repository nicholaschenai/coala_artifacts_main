    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple should be the length of the longest list, and the second element should be the longest list itself. If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, we can return any one of them.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found so far, starting with zero.\n   - Initialize another variable to store the list with the maximum length.\n   - Iterate over each list in the input list of lists.\n   - For each list, check its length.\n   - If the length of the current list is greater than the maximum length found so far, update the maximum length and store the current list as the longest list.\n   - After iterating through all lists, return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_length(list_of_lists):\n       max_len = 0\n       longest_list = []\n       \n       for each list in list_of_lists:\n           if length of list > max_len:\n               max_len = length of list\n               longest_list = list\n       \n       return (max_len, longest_list)\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_length(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize the maximum length to zero\n    max_len = 0\n    # Initialize the longest list as an empty list\n    longest_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        # Check if the current list's length is greater than the current maximum length\n        if len(lst) > max_len:\n            # Update the maximum length\n            max_len = len(lst)\n            # Update the longest list\n            longest_list = lst\n    \n    # Return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list\n    return (max_len, longest_list)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find and return the longest list and its length from a list of lists.",
