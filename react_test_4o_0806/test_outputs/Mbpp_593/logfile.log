You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/593 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes an IP address as a string input and removes any leading zeros from each of its segments. An IP address is typically represented in the format "x.x.x.x", where each "x" is a number between 0 and 255. The task is to ensure that each segment of the IP address does not have any leading zeros.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Split the IP address string into its four segments using the period ('.') as a delimiter.
   - For each segment, convert it to an integer to automatically remove any leading zeros.
   - Convert each integer back to a string.
   - Join the segments back together with periods to form the corrected IP address.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function removezero_ip(ip_address):
       split the ip_address by '.'
       for each segment in the split result:
           convert the segment to an integer (this removes leading zeros)
           convert the integer back to a string
       join the segments with '.' to form the new IP address
       return the new IP address
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def removezero_ip(ip_address: str) -> str:
    # Split the IP address into its segments
    segments = ip_address.split('.')
    
    # Process each segment to remove leading zeros
    processed_segments = []
    for segment in segments:
        # Convert to integer to remove leading zeros, then back to string
        processed_segment = str(int(segment))
        processed_segments.append(processed_segment)
    
    # Join the processed segments back into a single IP address string
    return '.'.join(processed_segments)
```

This solution effectively removes leading zeros from each segment of the IP address by leveraging the conversion to an integer, which inherently strips any leading zeros. The segments are then reassembled into a valid IP address format.
