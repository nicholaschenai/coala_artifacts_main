    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer `k`, and returns a new list that is identical to the original list but with the element at the `k`-th index removed.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will take the input list and the index `k`.\n   - We will create a new list that includes all elements from the original list except the one at index `k`.\n   - We can achieve this by slicing the list into two parts: one from the start to just before `k`, and the other from just after `k` to the end.\n   - We will then concatenate these two slices to form the new list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function remove_kth_element(lst, k):\n       return lst sliced from start to k (exclusive) + lst sliced from k+1 to end\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_kth_element(lst, k):\n    # Return a new list that is the concatenation of:\n    # - the sublist from the start to just before index k\n    # - the sublist from index k+1 to the end\n    return lst[:k] + lst[k+1:]\n```\n\nThis function will correctly remove the element at the `k`-th index from the list and return the modified list.",
