Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the sum of all odd natural numbers between two given numbers, `l` and `r`, inclusive.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n- Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of odd numbers.\n- Iterate through each number from `l` to `r`.\n- For each number, check if it is odd.\n- If the number is odd, add it to the sum.\n- After iterating through all numbers, return the sum.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction sum_in_range(l, r):\n    initialize sum to 0\n    for each number n from l to r:\n        if n is odd:\n            add n to sum\n    return sum\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(l: int, r: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of odd numbers to 0\n    sum_of_odds = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each number from l to r\n    for n in range(l, r + 1):\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if n % 2 != 0:\n            # Add the odd number to the sum\n            sum_of_odds += n\n    \n    # Return the total sum of odd numbers\n    return sum_of_odds\n```\n\nThis function will correctly calculate the sum of all odd natural numbers within the specified range `[l, r]`."
