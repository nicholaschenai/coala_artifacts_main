You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/797 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all odd natural numbers between two given numbers, `l` and `r`, inclusive.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
- Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of odd numbers.
- Iterate through each number from `l` to `r`.
- For each number, check if it is odd.
- If the number is odd, add it to the sum.
- After iterating through all numbers, return the sum.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function sum_in_range(l, r):
    initialize sum to 0
    for each number n from l to r:
        if n is odd:
            add n to sum
    return sum
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def sum_in_range(l: int, r: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum of odd numbers to 0
    sum_of_odds = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number from l to r
    for n in range(l, r + 1):
        # Check if the number is odd
        if n % 2 != 0:
            # Add the odd number to the sum
            sum_of_odds += n
    
    # Return the total sum of odd numbers
    return sum_of_odds
```

This function will correctly calculate the sum of all odd natural numbers within the specified range `[l, r]`.
