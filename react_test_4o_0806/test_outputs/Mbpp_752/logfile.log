INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/752 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the nth Jacobsthal number. The Jacobsthal sequence is defined as follows: 
- The 0th Jacobsthal number is 0.
- The 1st Jacobsthal number is 1.
- For n >= 2, the nth Jacobsthal number is given by the formula: `J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2)`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently calculate the nth Jacobsthal number. The recursive approach will follow the definition of the sequence, and memoization will help us avoid redundant calculations by storing previously computed values.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a helper function `jacobsthal_helper(n, memo)` that:
   - If `n` is 0, return 0.
   - If `n` is 1, return 1.
   - If `n` is already in `memo`, return `memo[n]`.
   - Otherwise, calculate `J(n)` using the formula `J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2)`.
   - Store the result in `memo[n]` and return it.

2. Define the main function `jacobsthal_num(n)` that:
   - Initializes an empty dictionary `memo` to store computed Jacobsthal numbers.
   - Calls `jacobsthal_helper(n, memo)` and returns the result.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def jacobsthal_helper(n, memo):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    
    # Calculate the nth Jacobsthal number using the recursive formula
    result = jacobsthal_helper(n - 1, memo) + 2 * jacobsthal_helper(n - 2, memo)
    memo[n] = result
    return result

def jacobsthal_num(n: int) -> int:
    memo = {}
    return jacobsthal_helper(n, memo)
```

This solution uses a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently compute the nth Jacobsthal number. The `jacobsthal_helper` function handles the recursive calculation and stores results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations. The main function `jacobsthal_num` initializes the memoization dictionary and calls the helper function to get the result.
