You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/142 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes three lists as input and counts how many items are identical and in the same position across all three lists.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through the indices of the lists.
2. For each index, we will check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same.
3. We will maintain a counter to keep track of how many such identical elements exist.
4. Finally, we will return the counter value.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a counter to zero.
2. Loop through the indices of the lists (assuming all lists are of the same length).
   - For each index, check if the elements in all three lists are the same.
   - If they are, increment the counter.
3. Return the counter.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of identical elements
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists
        if list1[i] == list2[i] == list3[i]:
            # Increment the counter if they are identical
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of identical elements
    return count
```

This function will correctly count the number of items that are identical and in the same position across the three given lists.
