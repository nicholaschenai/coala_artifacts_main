    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes three lists as input and counts how many items are identical and in the same position across all three lists.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate through the indices of the lists.\n2. For each index, we will check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same.\n3. We will maintain a counter to keep track of how many such identical elements exist.\n4. Finally, we will return the counter value.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a counter to zero.\n2. Loop through the indices of the lists (assuming all lists are of the same length).\n   - For each index, check if the elements in all three lists are the same.\n   - If they are, increment the counter.\n3. Return the counter.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of identical elements\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists\n        if list1[i] == list2[i] == list3[i]:\n            # Increment the counter if they are identical\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of identical elements\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of items that are identical and in the same position across the three given lists.",
