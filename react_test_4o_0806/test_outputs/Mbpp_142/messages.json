We will iterate through the indices of the lists.\n2. For each index, we will check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same.\n3. We will maintain a counter to keep track of how many such identical elements exist.\n4. Finally, we will return the counter value.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a counter to zero.\n2. Loop through the indices of the lists (assuming all lists are of the same length).\n   - For each index, check if the elements in all three lists are the same.\n   - If they are, increment the counter.\n3. Return the counter.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of identical elements\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists\n        if list1[i] == list2[i] == list3[i]:\n            # Increment the counter if they are identical\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of identical elements\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of items that are identical and in the same position across the three given lists."
