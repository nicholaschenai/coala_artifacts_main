You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/471 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and another integer `n`. The function should calculate the product of all the integers in the list and then return the remainder when this product is divided by `n`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize a Product Variable**: Start with a variable to hold the product of the numbers, initialized to 1.
2. **Iterate Through the List**: Multiply each number in the list with the product variable.
3. **Calculate the Remainder**: Once the product is calculated, find the remainder of the product when divided by `n`.
4. **Return the Remainder**: Return this remainder as the result.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_remainder(arr, n):
    initialize product to 1
    for each number in arr:
        multiply product by number
    remainder = product modulo n
    return remainder
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_remainder(arr, n):
    # Initialize the product to 1
    product = 1
    
    # Iterate through each number in the array
    for number in arr:
        # Multiply the current product by the number
        product *= number
    
    # Calculate the remainder of the product divided by n
    remainder = product % n
    
    # Return the remainder
    return remainder
```
