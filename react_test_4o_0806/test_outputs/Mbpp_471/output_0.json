    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of integers and another integer `n`. The function should calculate the product of all the integers in the list and then return the remainder when this product is divided by `n`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize a Product Variable**: Start with a variable to hold the product of the numbers, initialized to 1.\n2. **Iterate Through the List**: Multiply each number in the list with the product variable.\n3. **Calculate the Remainder**: Once the product is calculated, find the remainder of the product when divided by `n`.\n4. **Return the Remainder**: Return this remainder as the result.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_remainder(arr, n):\n    initialize product to 1\n    for each number in arr:\n        multiply product by number\n    remainder = product modulo n\n    return remainder\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    # Initialize the product to 1\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        # Multiply the current product by the number\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Calculate the remainder of the product divided by n\n    remainder = product % n\n    \n    # Return the remainder\n    return remainder\n```",
