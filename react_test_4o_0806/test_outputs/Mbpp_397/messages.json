The median is the middle value when the numbers are sorted in order.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo find the median of three numbers:\n1. Sort the three numbers in ascending order.\n2. The median will be the second number in this sorted list because it is the middle value.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `median_numbers` that takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n2. Create a list containing the three numbers: `[a, b, c]`.\n3. Sort the list.\n4. Return the second element of the sorted list as a float, which is the median.\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef median_numbers(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> float:\n    # Step 1: Create a list of the three numbers\n    numbers = [a, b, c]\n    \n    # Step 2: Sort the list\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the second element of the sorted list as a float\n    return float(numbers[1])\n```"
