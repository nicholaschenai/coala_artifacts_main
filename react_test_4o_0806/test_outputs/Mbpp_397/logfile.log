You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/397 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the median of these numbers. The median is the middle value when the numbers are sorted in order.

## Conceptual Solution

To find the median of three numbers:
1. Sort the three numbers in ascending order.
2. The median will be the second number in this sorted list because it is the middle value.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `median_numbers` that takes three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. Create a list containing the three numbers: `[a, b, c]`.
3. Sort the list.
4. Return the second element of the sorted list as a float, which is the median.

## Python Code

```python
def median_numbers(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> float:
    # Step 1: Create a list of the three numbers
    numbers = [a, b, c]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the list
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Return the second element of the sorted list as a float
    return float(numbers[1])
```

    numbers.sort()
