        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The median is the middle value in a list of numbers. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Since both lists are sorted and of the same size, we can merge them into a single sorted list.\n2. Once we have the merged sorted list, we can find the median.\n3. If the total number of elements in the merged list is odd, the median is the middle element.\n4. If the total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, one for each list.\n2. Create an empty list to store the merged elements.\n3. While both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists:\n   - Compare the elements at the current pointers.\n   - Append the smaller element to the merged list and move the corresponding pointer forward.\n4. If there are remaining elements in either list, append them to the merged list.\n5. Calculate the median:\n   - If the length of the merged list is odd, return the middle element.\n   - If the length is even, return the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef get_median(arr1, arr2, n):\n    # Initialize pointers for both arrays\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    # This will store the merged array\n    merged = []\n    \n    # Merge the two arrays\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:\n            merged.append(arr1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(arr2[j])\n            j += 1\n    \n    # If there are remaining elements in arr1\n    while i < n:\n        merged.append(arr1[i])\n        i += 1\n    \n    # If there are remaining elements in arr2\n    while j < n:\n        merged.append(arr2[j])\n        j += 1\n    \n    # Calculate the median\n    total_length = 2 * n\n    if total_length % 2 == 1:\n        # Odd length, return the middle element\n        return float(merged[total_length // 2])\n    else:\n        # Even length, return the average of the two middle elements\n        mid1 = total_length // 2 - 1\n        mid2 = total_length // 2\n        return (merged[mid1] + merged[mid2]) / 2.0\n\n# Example usage\nassert get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0\n```\n\nThis code merges the two sorted lists and then calculates the median of the merged list. The merging process ensures that the final list is sorted, allowing us to easily find the median."
