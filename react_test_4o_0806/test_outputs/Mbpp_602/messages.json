If there are no repeated characters, the function should return `None`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate through each character in the string.\n2. We will keep track of characters we have already seen using a set.\n3. As we iterate, we will check if the current character is already in the set:\n   - If it is, this character is the first repeated character, and we return it.\n   - If it is not, we add the character to the set and continue.\n4. If we finish iterating through the string without finding a repeated character, we return `None`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction first_repeated_char(s):\n    create an empty set called seen_chars\n    for each character c in string s:\n        if c is in seen_chars:\n            return c\n        else:\n            add c to seen_chars\n    return None\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(s: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen characters\n    seen_chars = set()\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for c in s:\n        # Check if the character is already in the set\n        if c in seen_chars:\n            # If it is, return this character as it is the first repeated one\n            return c\n        else:\n            # If not, add the character to the set\n            seen_chars.add(c)\n    \n    # If no repeated character is found, return None\n    return None\n```"
