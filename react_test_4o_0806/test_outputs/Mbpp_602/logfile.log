You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the first character that appears more than once in the string. If there are no repeated characters, the function should return `None`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through each character in the string.
2. We will keep track of characters we have already seen using a set.
3. As we iterate, we will check if the current character is already in the set:
   - If it is, this character is the first repeated character, and we return it.
   - If it is not, we add the character to the set and continue.
4. If we finish iterating through the string without finding a repeated character, we return `None`.

### Pseudocode

```
function first_repeated_char(s):
    create an empty set called seen_chars
    for each character c in string s:
        if c is in seen_chars:
            return c
        else:
            add c to seen_chars
    return None
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def first_repeated_char(s: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen characters
    seen_chars = set()
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for c in s:
        # Check if the character is already in the set
        if c in seen_chars:
            # If it is, return this character as it is the first repeated one
            return c
        else:
            # If not, add the character to the set
            seen_chars.add(c)
    
    # If no repeated character is found, return None
    return None
```
