You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]
Write a Python function that satisfies the description below. Your code must strictly follow the function name and typings of the input and output specified in the assert statement below, and pass the assertion when executed.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/455 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a month number (from 1 to 12) as input and returns `True` if that month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We know that the months with 31 days are January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. These correspond to the month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12.
   - The function should check if the given month number is one of these numbers.
   - If it is, the function should return `True`.
   - If it is not, the function should return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `check_monthnumb_number` that takes an integer `month_number`.
   - Create a set or list of month numbers that have 31 days: `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`.
   - Check if `month_number` is in this set.
   - Return `True` if it is, otherwise return `False`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**

```python
def check_monthnumb_number(month_number: int) -> bool:
    # Set of month numbers that have 31 days
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    
    # Check if the given month number is in the set of months with 31 days
    return month_number in months_with_31_days
```

This function will correctly determine if a given month number corresponds to a month with 31 days.
