These correspond to the month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12.\n   - The function should check if the given month number is one of these numbers.\n   - If it is, the function should return `True`.\n   - If it is not, the function should return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `check_monthnumb_number` that takes an integer `month_number`.\n   - Create a set or list of month numbers that have 31 days: `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`.\n   - Check if `month_number` is in this set.\n   - Return `True` if it is, otherwise return `False`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**\n\n```python\ndef check_monthnumb_number(month_number: int) -> bool:\n    # Set of month numbers that have 31 days\n    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}\n    \n    # Check if the given month number is in the set of months with 31 days\n    return month_number in months_with_31_days\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if a given month number corresponds to a month with 31 days."
