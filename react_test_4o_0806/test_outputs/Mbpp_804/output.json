    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that determines if the product of all numbers in a given list is even. If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Even Product**: A product of numbers is even if at least one of the numbers in the list is even. This is because multiplying any number by an even number results in an even product.\n\n2. **Approach**: \n   - Iterate through each number in the list.\n   - Check if any number is even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder).\n   - If an even number is found, return `True` immediately.\n   - If the loop completes without finding an even number, return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction is_product_even(numbers):\n    for each number in numbers:\n        if number is even:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_product_even(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If an even number is found, the product is even\n            return True\n    # If no even number is found, the product is not even\n    return False\n```",
