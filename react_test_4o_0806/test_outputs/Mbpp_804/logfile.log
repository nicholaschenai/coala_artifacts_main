You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/804 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that determines if the product of all numbers in a given list is even. If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Even Product**: A product of numbers is even if at least one of the numbers in the list is even. This is because multiplying any number by an even number results in an even product.

2. **Approach**: 
   - Iterate through each number in the list.
   - Check if any number is even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder).
   - If an even number is found, return `True` immediately.
   - If the loop completes without finding an even number, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_product_even(numbers):
    for each number in numbers:
        if number is even:
            return True
    return False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_product_even(numbers):
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the current number is even
        if number % 2 == 0:
            # If an even number is found, the product is even
            return True
    # If no even number is found, the product is not even
    return False
```

            # If an even number is found, the product is even
