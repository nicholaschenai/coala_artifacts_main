        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function `get_max_sum(n)` that calculates the maximum sum possible using the equation `f(n) = max((f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5)), n)`. The function should return the maximum sum for a given integer `n`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - The function `f(n)` is defined recursively. For a given `n`, it compares two values:\n     - The sum of the function applied to the integer divisions of `n` by 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n     - The value of `n` itself.\n   - The function should return the maximum of these two values.\n   - To avoid recalculating values for the same `n` multiple times, we can use memoization to store already computed results.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function get_max_sum(n):\n       Create a dictionary memo to store computed results\n\n       Define a helper function f(x):\n           If x is in memo, return memo[x]\n           If x is 0, return 0\n           Calculate sum_parts as f(x//2) + f(x//3) + f(x//4) + f(x//5)\n           Calculate result as max(sum_parts, x)\n           Store result in memo with key x\n           Return result\n\n       Return f(n)\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef get_max_sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Dictionary to store already computed results for memoization\n    memo = {}\n\n    # Helper function to compute f(x) using recursion and memoization\n    def f(x: int) -> int:\n        # If the result for x is already computed, return it\n        if x in memo:\n            return memo[x]\n        # Base case: if x is 0, the maximum sum is 0\n        if x == 0:\n            return 0\n        # Calculate the sum of f(x//2), f(x//3), f(x//4), and f(x//5)\n        sum_parts = f(x // 2) + f(x // 3) + f(x // 4) + f(x // 5)\n        # The result is the maximum of sum_parts and x itself\n        result = max(sum_parts, x)\n        # Store the result in the memo dictionary\n        memo[x] = result\n        return result\n\n    # Return the result of f(n)\n    return f(n)\n```"
