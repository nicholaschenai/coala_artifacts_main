You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/392 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function `get_max_sum(n)` that calculates the maximum sum possible using the equation `f(n) = max((f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5)), n)`. The function should return the maximum sum for a given integer `n`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - The function `f(n)` is defined recursively. For a given `n`, it compares two values:
     - The sum of the function applied to the integer divisions of `n` by 2, 3, 4, and 5.
     - The value of `n` itself.
   - The function should return the maximum of these two values.
   - To avoid recalculating values for the same `n` multiple times, we can use memoization to store already computed results.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function get_max_sum(n):
       Create a dictionary memo to store computed results

       Define a helper function f(x):
           If x is in memo, return memo[x]
           If x is 0, return 0
           Calculate sum_parts as f(x//2) + f(x//3) + f(x//4) + f(x//5)
           Calculate result as max(sum_parts, x)
           Store result in memo with key x
           Return result

       Return f(n)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def get_max_sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Dictionary to store already computed results for memoization
    memo = {}

    # Helper function to compute f(x) using recursion and memoization
    def f(x: int) -> int:
        # If the result for x is already computed, return it
        if x in memo:
            return memo[x]
        # Base case: if x is 0, the maximum sum is 0
        if x == 0:
            return 0
        # Calculate the sum of f(x//2), f(x//3), f(x//4), and f(x//5)
