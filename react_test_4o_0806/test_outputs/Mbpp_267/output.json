    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the first two odd natural numbers are 1 and 3, and their squares are 1 and 9, respectively. The sum of these squares is 10.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: The sequence of odd natural numbers starts from 1 and follows the pattern: 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. The `i-th` odd number can be represented as `2*i - 1`.\n2. **Square Each Odd Number**: For each of the first `n` odd numbers, calculate its square.\n3. **Sum the Squares**: Accumulate the sum of these squares.\n4. **Return the Result**: Return the accumulated sum as the result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction square_Sum(n):\n    initialize sum to 0\n    for i from 1 to n:\n        calculate the i-th odd number as 2*i - 1\n        square this odd number\n        add the square to sum\n    return sum\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    sum_of_squares = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n odd numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th odd number\n        odd_number = 2 * i - 1\n        # Add the square of the odd number to the sum\n        sum_of_squares += odd_number ** 2\n    \n    # Return the total sum of squares\n    return sum_of_squares\n```\n\nThis function calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers by iterating through the first `n` odd numbers, squaring each, and accumulating the result.",
