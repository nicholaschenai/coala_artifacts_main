You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/128 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and a string of words. The function should return a list of words from the string that have more than `n` characters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Split the input string into individual words.
   - Iterate over each word and check its length.
   - If a word's length is greater than `n`, add it to a result list.
   - Return the list of words that are longer than `n` characters.

3. **Pseudocode:**
   ```
   function long_words(n, sentence):
       split the sentence into a list of words
       initialize an empty list called result
       for each word in the list of words:
           if the length of the word is greater than n:
               append the word to the result list
       return the result list
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution:**

```python
def long_words(n: int, sentence: str) -> list:
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    # Initialize an empty list to store words longer than n
    result = []
    # Iterate over each word in the list
    for word in words:
        # Check if the word's length is greater than n
        if len(word) > n:
            # Add the word to the result list
            result.append(word)
    # Return the list of words longer than n
    return result
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and adheres to the problem requirements. It splits the input sentence into words, checks each word's length, and collects those that are longer than `n` into a list, which is then returned.

    # Iterate over each word in the list
    for word in words:
        # Check if the word's length is greater than n
        if len(word) > n:
            # Add the word to the result list
            result.append(word)
    # Return the list of words longer than n
