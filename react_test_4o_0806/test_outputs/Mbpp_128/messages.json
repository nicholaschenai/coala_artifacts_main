        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and a string of words. The function should return a list of words from the string that have more than `n` characters.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Split the input string into individual words.\n   - Iterate over each word and check its length.\n   - If a word's length is greater than `n`, add it to a result list.\n   - Return the list of words that are longer than `n` characters.\n\n3. **Pseudocode:**\n   ```\n   function long_words(n, sentence):\n       split the sentence into a list of words\n       initialize an empty list called result\n       for each word in the list of words:\n           if the length of the word is greater than n:\n               append the word to the result list\n       return the result list\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution:**\n\n```python\ndef long_words(n: int, sentence: str) -> list:\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    # Initialize an empty list to store words longer than n\n    result = []\n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word's length is greater than n\n        if len(word) > n:\n            # Add the word to the result list\n            result.append(word)\n    # Return the list of words longer than n\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and adheres to the problem requirements. It splits the input sentence into words, checks each word's length, and collects those that are longer than `n` into a list, which is then returned."
