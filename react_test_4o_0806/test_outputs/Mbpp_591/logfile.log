You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/591 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list as input and swaps the first and last elements of that list. The function should then return the modified list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, check if the list has more than one element. If it doesn't, swapping the first and last elements doesn't make sense, so we can return the list as is.
   - If the list has more than one element, swap the first element with the last element.
   - Return the modified list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function swap_List that takes a list as input
       If the length of the list is less than 2
           Return the list as is
       Otherwise
           Swap the first element with the last element
       Return the modified list
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def swap_List(lst):
    # Check if the list has more than one element
    if len(lst) < 2:
        # If not, return the list as is
        return lst
    
    # Swap the first and last elements
    lst[0], lst[-1] = lst[-1], lst[0]
    
    # Return the modified list
    return lst
```

This function will correctly swap the first and last elements of the list, provided the list has at least two elements. If the list has fewer than two elements, it will simply return the list unchanged.
