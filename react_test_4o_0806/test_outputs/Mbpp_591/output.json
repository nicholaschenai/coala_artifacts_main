    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a list as input and swaps the first and last elements of that list. The function should then return the modified list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, check if the list has more than one element. If it doesn't, swapping the first and last elements doesn't make sense, so we can return the list as is.\n   - If the list has more than one element, swap the first element with the last element.\n   - Return the modified list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function swap_List that takes a list as input\n       If the length of the list is less than 2\n           Return the list as is\n       Otherwise\n           Swap the first element with the last element\n       Return the modified list\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef swap_List(lst):\n    # Check if the list has more than one element\n    if len(lst) < 2:\n        # If not, return the list as is\n        return lst\n    \n    # Swap the first and last elements\n    lst[0], lst[-1] = lst[-1], lst[0]\n    \n    # Return the modified list\n    return lst\n```\n\nThis function will correctly swap the first and last elements of the list, provided the list has at least two elements. If the list has fewer than two elements, it will simply return the list unchanged.",
