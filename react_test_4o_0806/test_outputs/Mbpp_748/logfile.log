You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/748 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a string as input and inserts spaces before each word that starts with a capital letter. If the string is a single word starting with a capital letter, it should remain unchanged.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize an empty list to store the characters of the new string.
2. Iterate over each character in the input string.
3. For each character, check if it is a capital letter and if it is not the first character in the string.
4. If it is a capital letter and not the first character, append a space to the list before appending the character.
5. Append the character to the list.
6. Join the list into a single string and return it.

## Pseudocode

```
function capital_words_spaces(s):
    initialize an empty list result
    for each character c in string s with index i:
        if c is uppercase and i is not 0:
            append a space to result
        append c to result
    return the joined string from result
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def capital_words_spaces(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string with its index
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        # Check if the character is uppercase and not the first character
        if c.isupper() and i != 0:
            # Append a space before the character
            result.append(' ')
        # Append the character itself
        result.append(c)
    
    # Join the list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(result)
```
