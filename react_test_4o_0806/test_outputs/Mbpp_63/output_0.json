    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should find the maximum difference between the two integers in any of the tuples and return that maximum difference.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum difference found so far. Start with a value of zero.\n2. Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n3. For each tuple, calculate the absolute difference between the two integers.\n4. If this difference is greater than the current maximum difference, update the maximum difference.\n5. After checking all tuples, return the maximum difference found.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_difference(tuple_list):\n    max_diff = 0\n    for each tuple in tuple_list:\n        calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers in the tuple\n        if this difference is greater than max_diff:\n            update max_diff with this difference\n    return max_diff\n```\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_difference(tuple_list):\n    # Initialize the maximum difference to zero\n    max_diff = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for a, b in tuple_list:\n        # Calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers in the tuple\n        diff = abs(a - b)\n        \n        # Update max_diff if the current difference is greater\n        if diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = diff\n    \n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_diff\n```",
