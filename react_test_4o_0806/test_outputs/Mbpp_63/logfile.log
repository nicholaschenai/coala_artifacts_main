You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/63 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should find the maximum difference between the two integers in any of the tuples and return that maximum difference.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum difference found so far. Start with a value of zero.
2. Iterate over each tuple in the list.
3. For each tuple, calculate the absolute difference between the two integers.
4. If this difference is greater than the current maximum difference, update the maximum difference.
5. After checking all tuples, return the maximum difference found.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_difference(tuple_list):
    max_diff = 0
    for each tuple in tuple_list:
        calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers in the tuple
        if this difference is greater than max_diff:
            update max_diff with this difference
    return max_diff
```

## Python Solution

```python
def max_difference(tuple_list):
    # Initialize the maximum difference to zero
    max_diff = 0
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for a, b in tuple_list:
        # Calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers in the tuple
        diff = abs(a - b)
        
        # Update max_diff if the current difference is greater
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff
    
    # Return the maximum difference found
    return max_diff
