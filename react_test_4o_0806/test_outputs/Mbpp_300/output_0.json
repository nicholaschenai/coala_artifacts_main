    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the number of binary sequences of length `2n` such that the sum of the first `n` bits is equal to the sum of the last `n` bits. In simpler terms, we want to count how many ways we can split a binary sequence of length `2n` into two halves, each of length `n`, such that both halves have the same number of `1`s.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: For a binary sequence of length `2n`, we can split it into two halves of length `n`. We need to ensure that the number of `1`s in the first half is equal to the number of `1`s in the second half.\n\n2. **Combinatorial Approach**: \n   - For each possible number of `1`s in the first half (let's call it `k`), there must be exactly `k` `1`s in the second half.\n   - The number of ways to choose `k` `1`s from `n` bits is given by the binomial coefficient `C(n, k)`.\n   - Therefore, for each `k`, the number of valid sequences is `C(n, k) * C(n, k)` because we choose `k` `1`s for the first half and `k` `1`s for the second half independently.\n\n3. **Summing Up**: We sum up the products of binomial coefficients for all possible values of `k` from `0` to `n`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_binary_seq(n):\n    initialize total_count to 0\n    for k from 0 to n:\n        calculate C(n, k) as binomial coefficient\n        add C(n, k) * C(n, k) to total_count\n    return total_count\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n    if k > n:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    k = min(k, n - k)  # Take advantage of symmetry\n    c = 1\n    for i in range(k):\n        c = c * (n - i) // (i + 1)\n    return c\n\ndef count_binary_seq(n: int) -> float:\n    total_count = 0\n    for k in range(n + 1):\n        c_n_k = binomial_coefficient(n, k)\n        total_count += c_n_k * c_n_k\n    return float(total_count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`binomial_coefficient` Function**: This helper function calculates the binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` using an iterative approach to avoid large intermediate values.\n- **`count_binary_seq` Function**: This function iterates over all possible numbers of `1`s (`k`) in the first half of the sequence, calculates the number of valid sequences for each `k`, and sums them up to get the total count. The result is returned as a float to match the expected output type.",
