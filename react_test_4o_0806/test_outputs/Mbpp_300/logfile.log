We need to find the number of binary sequences of length `2n` such that the sum of the first `n` bits is equal to the sum of the last `n` bits. In simpler terms, we want to count how many ways we can split a binary sequence of length `2n` into two halves, each of length `n`, such that both halves have the same number of `1`s.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**: For a binary sequence of length `2n`, we can split it into two halves of length `n`. We need to ensure that the number of `1`s in the first half is equal to the number of `1`s in the second half.

2. **Combinatorial Approach**: 
   - For each possible number of `1`s in the first half (let's call it `k`), there must be exactly `k` `1`s in the second half.
   - The number of ways to choose `k` `1`s from `n` bits is given by the binomial coefficient `C(n, k)`.
   - Therefore, for each `k`, the number of valid sequences is `C(n, k) * C(n, k)` because we choose `k` `1`s for the first half and `k` `1`s for the second half independently.

3. **Summing Up**: We sum up the products of binomial coefficients for all possible values of `k` from `0` to `n`.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_binary_seq(n):
    initialize total_count to 0
    for k from 0 to n:
        calculate C(n, k) as binomial coefficient
        add C(n, k) * C(n, k) to total_count
    return total_count
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    if k > n:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    k = min(k, n - k)  # Take advantage of symmetry
    c = 1
    for i in range(k):
        c = c * (n - i) // (i + 1)
    return c

def count_binary_seq(n: int) -> float:
    total_count = 0
    for k in range(n + 1):
        c_n_k = binomial_coefficient(n, k)
        total_count += c_n_k * c_n_k
    return float(total_count)
```

### Explanation

- **`binomial_coefficient` Function**: This helper function calculates the binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` using an iterative approach to avoid large intermediate values.
- **`count_binary_seq` Function**: This function iterates over all possible numbers of `1`s (`k`) in the first half of the sequence, calculates the number of valid sequences for each `k`, and sums them up to get the total count. The result is returned as a float to match the expected output type.

In simpler terms, we want to count how many ways we can split a binary sequence of length `2n` into two halves, each of length `n`, such that both halves have the same number of `1`s.

2. **Combinatorial Approach**: 
   - For each possible number of `1`s in the first half (let's call it `k`), there must be exactly `k` `1`s in the second half.
   - The number of ways to choose `k` `1`s from `n` bits is given by the binomial coefficient `C(n, k)`.
   - Therefore, for each `k`, the number of valid sequences is `C(n, k) * C(n, k)` because we choose `k` `1`s for the first half and `k` `1`s for the second half independently.
