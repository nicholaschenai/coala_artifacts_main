You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/578 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes three lists of equal length and combines them into a single list by taking one element from each list in turn. The result should be a flat list where elements from the first, second, and third lists are interleaved.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate over the indices of the lists since they are all of the same length. For each index, we will take the element from the first list, then the element from the second list, and finally the element from the third list, and append them to a new list. This process will be repeated for all indices, resulting in an interleaved list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function interleave_lists(list1, list2, list3)
       Initialize an empty list called interleaved_list
       For each index i from 0 to the length of list1 (or list2 or list3) - 1
           Append list1[i] to interleaved_list
           Append list2[i] to interleaved_list
           Append list3[i] to interleaved_list
       Return interleaved_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def interleave_lists(list1, list2, list3):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the interleaved elements
    interleaved_list = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Append the element from the first list at index i
        interleaved_list.append(list1[i])
        # Append the element from the second list at index i
        interleaved_list.append(list2[i])
        # Append the element from the third list at index i
        interleaved_list.append(list3[i])
    
    # Return the interleaved list
    return interleaved_list
```

This solution iterates over the indices of the lists and appends elements from each list in turn to create the interleaved list. The function assumes that all input lists are of the same length, as specified in the problem statement.
