        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the character 'a' followed immediately by either two or three 'b' characters. The function should return `True` if such a pattern exists in the string and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and look for the character 'a'. Once we find an 'a', we will check the next two or three characters to see if they are all 'b'. If we find such a sequence, we return `True`. If we finish checking the entire string without finding the pattern, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function text_match_two_three with parameter s\n       Loop through each character in the string s using an index i\n           If the character at index i is 'a'\n               Check if the next two characters (i+1 and i+2) are 'b'\n                   If true, return True\n               Else, check if the next three characters (i+1, i+2, and i+3) are 'b'\n                   If true, return True\n       If no pattern is found, return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef text_match_two_three(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Loop through each character in the string s using an index i\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # If the character at index i is 'a'\n        if s[i] == 'a':\n            # Check if the next two characters are 'b'\n            if i + 2 < len(s) and s[i+1] == 'b' and s[i+2] == 'b':\n                return True\n            # Check if the next three characters are 'b'\n            if i + 3 < len(s) and s[i+1] == 'b' and s[i+2] == 'b' and s[i+3] == 'b':\n                return True\n    # If no pattern is found, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the string, checking for the specified pattern, and returns the appropriate boolean value based on whether the pattern is found."
