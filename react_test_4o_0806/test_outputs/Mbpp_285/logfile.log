You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/285 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the character 'a' followed immediately by either two or three 'b' characters. The function should return `True` if such a pattern exists in the string and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and look for the character 'a'. Once we find an 'a', we will check the next two or three characters to see if they are all 'b'. If we find such a sequence, we return `True`. If we finish checking the entire string without finding the pattern, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function text_match_two_three with parameter s
       Loop through each character in the string s using an index i
           If the character at index i is 'a'
               Check if the next two characters (i+1 and i+2) are 'b'
                   If true, return True
               Else, check if the next three characters (i+1, i+2, and i+3) are 'b'
                   If true, return True
       If no pattern is found, return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_match_two_three(s: str) -> bool:
    # Loop through each character in the string s using an index i
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # If the character at index i is 'a'
        if s[i] == 'a':
            # Check if the next two characters are 'b'
            if i + 2 < len(s) and s[i+1] == 'b' and s[i+2] == 'b':
                return True
            # Check if the next three characters are 'b'
            if i + 3 < len(s) and s[i+1] == 'b' and s[i+2] == 'b' and s[i+3] == 'b':
                return True
    # If no pattern is found, return False
    return False
```

This solution iterates through the string, checking for the specified pattern, and returns the appropriate boolean value based on whether the pattern is found.
