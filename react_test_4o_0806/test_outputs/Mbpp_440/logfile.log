INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that finds the first adverb in a given sentence and returns its starting and ending positions along with the adverb itself. An adverb is typically a word that ends with "ly". The function should return a tuple containing the starting index, ending index, and the adverb.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Split the sentence into words. This can be done by splitting the sentence on spaces.
2. Iterate over each word and check if it ends with "ly".
3. If a word ends with "ly", determine its starting and ending positions in the original sentence.
4. Return a tuple with the starting index, ending index, and the adverb.
5. If no adverb is found, the function should return `None`.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `find_adverb_position` that takes a string `sentence`.
2. Split the `sentence` into words using the `split()` method.
3. Initialize a variable `current_index` to 0 to keep track of the position in the original sentence.
4. For each `word` in the list of words:
   - Check if the `word` ends with "ly".
   - If it does:
     - Calculate the starting index as `current_index`.
     - Calculate the ending index as `current_index + len(word)`.
     - Return a tuple `(starting_index, ending_index, word)`.
   - Update `current_index` by adding the length of the `word` plus one (for the space).
5. If no adverb is found, return `None`.

## Final Python Solution

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/440 [generation text] ## Analysis of the Problem

The code is failing because it does not correctly identify words that end with "ly" when they are followed by punctuation marks. In the test case provided, the word "clearly" is followed by "!!", which means the `endswith("ly")` check fails because the word is actually "clearly!!" in the split list.

## Where the Solution Went Wrong

1. **Handling Punctuation**: The current solution does not account for punctuation marks that may be attached to words. This causes the `endswith("ly")` check to fail when punctuation is present.

2. **Word Splitting**: The solution assumes that splitting by spaces will yield clean words, but punctuation can be attached to words, affecting the check for "ly".

## Revised Solution Approach

1. **Strip Punctuation**: Before checking if a word ends with "ly", strip any trailing punctuation from the word.
2. **Recalculate Indices**: After identifying the adverb, calculate the starting and ending indices based on the cleaned word.

## Revised Pseudocode

1. Define a function `find_adverb_position` that takes a string `sentence`.
2. Split the `sentence` into words using the `split()` method.
3. Initialize a variable `current_index` to 0 to keep track of the position in the original sentence.
4. For each `word` in the list of words:
   - Strip any trailing punctuation from the `word`.
   - Check if the cleaned word ends with "ly".
   - If it does:
     - Calculate the starting index as `current_index`.
     - Calculate the ending index as `current_index + len(cleaned_word)`.
     - Return a tuple `(starting_index, ending_index, cleaned_word)`.
   - Update `current_index` by adding the length of the original `word` plus one (for the space).
5. If no adverb is found, return `None`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_adverb_position(sentence: str):
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    # Initialize the current index to track the position in the original sentence
    current_index = 0
    
    # Iterate over each word
    for word in words:
        # Strip punctuation from the end of the word
        cleaned_word = word.rstrip('.,!?;:')
        
        # Check if the cleaned word ends with "ly"
        if cleaned_word.endswith("ly"):
            # Calculate the starting and ending indices
            starting_index = current_index
            ending_index = current_index + len(cleaned_word)
