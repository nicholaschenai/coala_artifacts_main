    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that finds the first adverb in a given sentence and returns its starting and ending positions along with the adverb itself. An adverb is typically a word that ends with \"ly\". The function should return a tuple containing the starting index, ending index, and the adverb.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Split the sentence into words. This can be done by splitting the sentence on spaces.\n2. Iterate over each word and check if it ends with \"ly\".\n3. If a word ends with \"ly\", determine its starting and ending positions in the original sentence.\n4. Return a tuple with the starting index, ending index, and the adverb.\n5. If no adverb is found, the function should return `None`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `find_adverb_position` that takes a string `sentence`.\n2. Split the `sentence` into words using the `split()` method.\n3. Initialize a variable `current_index` to 0 to keep track of the position in the original sentence.\n4. For each `word` in the list of words:\n   - Check if the `word` ends with \"ly\".\n   - If it does:\n     - Calculate the starting index as `current_index`.\n     - Calculate the ending index as `current_index + len(word)`.\n     - Return a tuple `(starting_index, ending_index, word)`.\n   - Update `current_index` by adding the length of the `word` plus one (for the space).\n5. If no adverb is found, return `None`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str):\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    # Initialize the current index to track the position in the original sentence\n    current_index = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each word\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word ends with \"ly\"\n        if word.endswith(\"ly\"):\n            # Calculate the starting and ending indices\n            starting_index = current_index\n            ending_index = current_index + len(word)\n            # Return the tuple with starting index, ending index, and the adverb\n            return (starting_index, ending_index, word)\n        \n        # Update the current index for the next word\n        current_index += len(word) + 1  # +1 for the space\n    \n    # If no adverb is found, return None\n    return None\n```\n",
