In Python, we can easily achieve this by using the `join` method, which concatenates the elements of an iterable (like a tuple) into a single string. We will use an empty string as the separator since we want the characters to be joined without any additional characters between them.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `tup_string` that takes a single parameter `tup`.\n   - Use the `join` method on an empty string to concatenate all elements of the tuple `tup`.\n   - Return the resulting string.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef tup_string(tup: tuple) -> str:\n    # Use the join method to concatenate all characters in the tuple into a single string\n    return ''.join(tup)\n```\n\nThis function will take a tuple of characters and return a string with all the characters concatenated together, as required by the problem statement."
