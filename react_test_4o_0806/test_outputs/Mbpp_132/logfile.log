You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/132 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a tuple of characters as input and returns a single string that concatenates all the characters in the tuple.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The task is to convert a tuple of characters into a string. In Python, we can easily achieve this by using the `join` method, which concatenates the elements of an iterable (like a tuple) into a single string. We will use an empty string as the separator since we want the characters to be joined without any additional characters between them.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `tup_string` that takes a single parameter `tup`.
   - Use the `join` method on an empty string to concatenate all elements of the tuple `tup`.
   - Return the resulting string.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def tup_string(tup: tuple) -> str:
    # Use the join method to concatenate all characters in the tuple into a single string
    return ''.join(tup)
```

This function will take a tuple of characters and return a string with all the characters concatenated together, as required by the problem statement.
