You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/394 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if a given tuple contains any duplicate elements. If there are duplicates, the function should return `False`; otherwise, it should return `True`.

## Conceptual Solution

To determine if a tuple contains duplicates, we can use the property of sets in Python. A set is a collection that automatically removes duplicate elements. Therefore, if we convert the tuple to a set and the length of the set is the same as the length of the tuple, it means there are no duplicates. If the lengths differ, it means there were duplicates in the tuple.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `check_distinct` that takes a tuple as an argument.
2. Convert the tuple to a set.
3. Compare the length of the set with the length of the tuple.
4. If the lengths are equal, return `True` (no duplicates).
5. If the lengths are not equal, return `False` (duplicates exist).

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_distinct(t: tuple) -> bool:
    # Convert the tuple to a set, which removes duplicates
    unique_elements = set(t)
    # Compare the length of the set with the length of the tuple
    # If they are equal, there are no duplicates
    return len(unique_elements) == len(t)
```
