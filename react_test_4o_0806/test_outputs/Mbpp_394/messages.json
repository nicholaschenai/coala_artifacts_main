        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that checks if a given tuple contains any duplicate elements. If there are duplicates, the function should return `False`; otherwise, it should return `True`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo determine if a tuple contains duplicates, we can use the property of sets in Python. A set is a collection that automatically removes duplicate elements. Therefore, if we convert the tuple to a set and the length of the set is the same as the length of the tuple, it means there are no duplicates. If the lengths differ, it means there were duplicates in the tuple.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `check_distinct` that takes a tuple as an argument.\n2. Convert the tuple to a set.\n3. Compare the length of the set with the length of the tuple.\n4. If the lengths are equal, return `True` (no duplicates).\n5. If the lengths are not equal, return `False` (duplicates exist).\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_distinct(t: tuple) -> bool:\n    # Convert the tuple to a set, which removes duplicates\n    unique_elements = set(t)\n    # Compare the length of the set with the length of the tuple\n    # If they are equal, there are no duplicates\n    return len(unique_elements) == len(t)\n```"
