For example, given the list `[11, 33, 50]`, the function should return the integer `113350`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Convert Each Integer to a String**: Since integers cannot be concatenated directly, we will first convert each integer in the list to a string.\n2. **Concatenate the Strings**: Join all the string representations of the integers together to form a single string.\n3. **Convert the Resulting String Back to an Integer**: Finally, convert the concatenated string back to an integer to get the desired result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `multiple_to_single` that takes a list of integers as input.\n2. Convert each integer in the list to a string.\n3. Concatenate all the string representations.\n4. Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.\n5. Return the resulting integer.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef multiple_to_single(numbers: list) -> int:\n    # Step 1: Convert each integer in the list to a string\n    string_numbers = [str(number) for number in numbers]\n    \n    # Step 2: Concatenate all the string representations\n    concatenated_string = ''.join(string_numbers)\n    \n    # Step 3: Convert the concatenated string back to an integer\n    result = int(concatenated_string)\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the resulting integer\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take a list of integers, convert each to a string, concatenate them, and then convert the result back to an integer, effectively joining the list of integers into a single integer."
