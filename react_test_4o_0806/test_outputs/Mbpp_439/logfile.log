You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and combines them into a single integer. For example, given the list `[11, 33, 50]`, the function should return the integer `113350`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Convert Each Integer to a String**: Since integers cannot be concatenated directly, we will first convert each integer in the list to a string.
2. **Concatenate the Strings**: Join all the string representations of the integers together to form a single string.
3. **Convert the Resulting String Back to an Integer**: Finally, convert the concatenated string back to an integer to get the desired result.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `multiple_to_single` that takes a list of integers as input.
2. Convert each integer in the list to a string.
3. Concatenate all the string representations.
4. Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.
5. Return the resulting integer.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def multiple_to_single(numbers: list) -> int:
    # Step 1: Convert each integer in the list to a string
    string_numbers = [str(number) for number in numbers]
    
    # Step 2: Concatenate all the string representations
    concatenated_string = ''.join(string_numbers)
    
    # Step 3: Convert the concatenated string back to an integer
    result = int(concatenated_string)
    
    # Step 4: Return the resulting integer
    return result
```

This function will take a list of integers, convert each to a string, concatenate them, and then convert the result back to an integer, effectively joining the list of integers into a single integer.
