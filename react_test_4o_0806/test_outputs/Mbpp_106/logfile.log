You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Problem
[BEGIN PROBLEM]

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/106 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain all the elements of the original tuple followed by all the elements of the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, we need to convert the list into a tuple because tuples are immutable, and we cannot directly append a list to a tuple.
   - Then, we concatenate the original tuple with the newly converted tuple from the list.
   - Finally, return the concatenated tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `add_lists` that takes two parameters: a list and a tuple.
   - Convert the list to a tuple.
   - Concatenate the original tuple with the converted tuple.
   - Return the concatenated tuple.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def add_lists(lst, tpl):
    # Convert the list to a tuple
    list_as_tuple = tuple(lst)
    
    # Concatenate the original tuple with the converted tuple
    result = tpl + list_as_tuple
    
    # Return the concatenated tuple
    return result
```

This function will take a list and a tuple, convert the list to a tuple, concatenate it with the original tuple, and return the resulting tuple.
