You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/278 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a tuple as input and returns the number of elements that appear before the first occurrence of another tuple within the given tuple. 

### Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate through the elements of the input tuple.
2. Check each element to see if it is a tuple.
3. Count the number of elements before the first tuple is encountered.
4. Return this count.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a counter to zero.
2. Loop through each element in the input tuple:
   - If the element is a tuple, break the loop.
   - Otherwise, increment the counter.
3. Return the counter.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def count_first_elements(t: tuple) -> int:
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of elements before the first tuple
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the input tuple
    for element in t:
        # Check if the current element is a tuple
        if isinstance(element, tuple):
            # If it is a tuple, break the loop as we found the first tuple
            break
        # If it is not a tuple, increment the counter
        count += 1
    
    # Return the count of elements before the first tuple
    return count
```

This solution iterates through the tuple, checking each element to see if it is a tuple. It counts the elements until it encounters the first tuple, then returns that count.
