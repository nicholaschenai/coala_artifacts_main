    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a tuple as input and returns the number of elements that appear before the first occurrence of another tuple within the given tuple. \n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Iterate through the elements of the input tuple.\n2. Check each element to see if it is a tuple.\n3. Count the number of elements before the first tuple is encountered.\n4. Return this count.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a counter to zero.\n2. Loop through each element in the input tuple:\n   - If the element is a tuple, break the loop.\n   - Otherwise, increment the counter.\n3. Return the counter.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_first_elements(t: tuple) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of elements before the first tuple\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the input tuple\n    for element in t:\n        # Check if the current element is a tuple\n        if isinstance(element, tuple):\n            # If it is a tuple, break the loop as we found the first tuple\n            break\n        # If it is not a tuple, increment the counter\n        count += 1\n    \n    # Return the count of elements before the first tuple\n    return count\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the tuple, checking each element to see if it is a tuple. It counts the elements until it encounters the first tuple, then returns that count.",
