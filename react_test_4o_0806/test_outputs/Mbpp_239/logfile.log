INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/239 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the number of sequences of length `n` where each element in the sequence is a positive integer. Each element must be at least twice the previous element and must not exceed a given maximum value `m`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Constraints**: 
   - Each sequence starts with a positive integer.
   - Each subsequent element must be at least twice the previous element.
   - No element can exceed `m`.
   - The sequence must be exactly of length `n`.

2. **Approach**:
   - Use a recursive function to explore all possible sequences.
   - Start with the first element and try all possible values from 1 to `m`.
   - For each element, recursively determine the next element by ensuring it is at least twice the current element and does not exceed `m`.
   - Count sequences that reach the desired length `n`.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - Define a recursive function `count_sequences(current_value, current_length)`:
     - If `current_length` equals `n`, return 1 (a valid sequence is found).
     - Initialize a counter to zero.
     - For each possible next value (from `2 * current_value` to `m`), recursively call the function to extend the sequence.
     - Accumulate the count of valid sequences.
   - Start the recursion with `current_value` as 1 and `current_length` as 1.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_sequences(current_value, current_length):
    if current_length == n:
        return 1
    count = 0
    for next_value from 2 * current_value to m:
        count += count_sequences(next_value, current_length + 1)
    return count

function get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):
    total_count = 0
    for start_value from 1 to m:
        total_count += count_sequences(start_value, 1)
    return total_count
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_sequences(current_value, current_length, m, n):
    # Base case: if the sequence length is n, we have a valid sequence
    if current_length == n:
        return 1
    
    count = 0
    # Try all possible next values that are at least twice the current value
    for next_value in range(2 * current_value, m + 1):
        count += count_sequences(next_value, current_length + 1, m, n)
    
    return count

def get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):
    total_count = 0
    # Start sequences with each possible starting value from 1 to m
    for start_value in range(1, m + 1):
        total_count += count_sequences(start_value, 1, m, n)
    
    return total_count
```

This solution uses a recursive approach to explore all possible sequences, ensuring each element is at least twice the previous one and does not exceed `m`. The function `get_total_number_of_sequences` initializes the process by trying all possible starting values.
