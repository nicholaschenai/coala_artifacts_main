    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the number of sequences of length `n` where each element in the sequence is a positive integer. Each element must be at least twice the previous element and must not exceed a given maximum value `m`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - Each sequence starts with a positive integer.\n   - Each subsequent element must be at least twice the previous element.\n   - No element can exceed `m`.\n   - The sequence must be exactly of length `n`.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n   - Use a recursive function to explore all possible sequences.\n   - Start with the first element and try all possible values from 1 to `m`.\n   - For each element, recursively determine the next element by ensuring it is at least twice the current element and does not exceed `m`.\n   - Count sequences that reach the desired length `n`.\n\n3. **Recursive Function**:\n   - Define a recursive function `count_sequences(current_value, current_length)`:\n     - If `current_length` equals `n`, return 1 (a valid sequence is found).\n     - Initialize a counter to zero.\n     - For each possible next value (from `2 * current_value` to `m`), recursively call the function to extend the sequence.\n     - Accumulate the count of valid sequences.\n   - Start the recursion with `current_value` as 1 and `current_length` as 1.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_sequences(current_value, current_length):\n    if current_length == n:\n        return 1\n    count = 0\n    for next_value from 2 * current_value to m:\n        count += count_sequences(next_value, current_length + 1)\n    return count\n\nfunction get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    total_count = 0\n    for start_value from 1 to m:\n        total_count += count_sequences(start_value, 1)\n    return total_count\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_sequences(current_value, current_length, m, n):\n    # Base case: if the sequence length is n, we have a valid sequence\n    if current_length == n:\n        return 1\n    \n    count = 0\n    # Try all possible next values that are at least twice the current value\n    for next_value in range(2 * current_value, m + 1):\n        count += count_sequences(next_value, current_length + 1, m, n)\n    \n    return count\n\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    total_count = 0\n    # Start sequences with each possible starting value from 1 to m\n    for start_value in range(1, m + 1):\n        total_count += count_sequences(start_value, 1, m, n)\n    \n    return total_count\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive approach to explore all possible sequences, ensuring each element is at least twice the previous one and does not exceed `m`. The function `get_total_number_of_sequences` initializes the process by trying all possible starting values.",
