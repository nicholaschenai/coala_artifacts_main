The function should return a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the two input lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over the indices of the input lists.\n   - For each index, we will add the elements from both lists at that index.\n   - We will store these sums in a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return the new list containing all the sums.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function sum_list with parameters list1 and list2\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each index i from 0 to the length of list1 (or list2) - 1\n           Add the elements at index i from both lists and append the sum to result\n       Return the result list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_list(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the sums\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Add the elements at the current index from both lists\n        # Append the sum to the result list\n        result.append(list1[i] + list2[i])\n    \n    # Return the list containing the sums\n    return result\n```"
