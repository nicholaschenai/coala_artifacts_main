You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/728 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers as input. Each list has the same length. The function should return a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the two input lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over the indices of the input lists.
   - For each index, we will add the elements from both lists at that index.
   - We will store these sums in a new list.
   - Finally, we will return the new list containing all the sums.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function sum_list with parameters list1 and list2
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each index i from 0 to the length of list1 (or list2) - 1
           Add the elements at index i from both lists and append the sum to result
       Return the result list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_list(list1, list2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sums
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Add the elements at the current index from both lists
        # Append the sum to the result list
        result.append(list1[i] + list2[i])
    
    # Return the list containing the sums
    return result
```
