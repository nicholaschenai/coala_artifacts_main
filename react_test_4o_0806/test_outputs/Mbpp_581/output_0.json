    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a Python function that calculates the surface area of a square pyramid given its base edge length and height. The function should return the surface area as an integer.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry**: A square pyramid has a square base and four triangular faces. The surface area is the sum of the area of the base and the areas of the four triangular faces.\n\n2. **Calculate the Base Area**: The base is a square, so its area is the square of the base edge length.\n\n3. **Calculate the Slant Height**: The slant height of the pyramid is the height of the triangular faces. It can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. If `b` is the base edge length and `h` is the height of the pyramid, the slant height `l` is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   l = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 + h^2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Lateral Surface Area**: Each triangular face has a base of `b` and a height of `l`. The area of one triangle is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times b \\times l\\). Since there are four triangles, the total lateral surface area is \\(2 \\times b \\times l\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Surface Area**: Add the base area and the lateral surface area to get the total surface area.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction surface_Area(base_edge, height):\n    base_area = base_edge * base_edge\n    slant_height = sqrt((base_edge / 2) ** 2 + height ** 2)\n    lateral_surface_area = 2 * base_edge * slant_height\n    total_surface_area = base_area + lateral_surface_area\n    return total_surface_area\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef surface_Area(base_edge: int, height: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of the base (square)\n    base_area = base_edge * base_edge\n    \n    # Calculate the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem\n    slant_height = ((base_edge / 2) ** 2 + height ** 2) ** 0.5\n    \n    # Calculate the lateral surface area (4 triangles)\n    lateral_surface_area = 2 * base_edge * slant_height\n    \n    # Calculate the total surface area\n    total_surface_area = base_area + lateral_surface_area\n    \n    # Return the total surface area as an integer\n    return int(total_surface_area)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the surface area of a square pyramid by first determining the base area, then the slant height, and finally the lateral surface area. The sum of the base area and the lateral surface area gives the total surface area, which is returned as an integer.",
