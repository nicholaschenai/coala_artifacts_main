The function should remove any names that start with a lowercase letter, then calculate and return the sum of the lengths of the remaining names.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total length of the names that start with an uppercase letter.\n2. Iterate through each name in the list.\n3. For each name, check if the first character is an uppercase letter.\n4. If it is, add the length of that name to the total length.\n5. After iterating through all the names, return the total length.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction sample_nam(names):\n    initialize total_length to 0\n    for each name in names:\n        if the first character of name is uppercase:\n            add the length of name to total_length\n    return total_length\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef sample_nam(names: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize the total length to 0\n    total_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each name in the list\n    for name in names:\n        # Check if the first character of the name is uppercase\n        if name[0].isupper():\n            # Add the length of the name to the total length\n            total_length += len(name)\n    \n    # Return the total length of names that start with an uppercase letter\n    return total_length\n```"
