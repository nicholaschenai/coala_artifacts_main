        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function called `pancake_sort` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   The problem suggests using a sorting algorithm, and given the function name `pancake_sort`, it implies using the pancake sorting algorithm. Pancake sorting involves repeatedly flipping sublists of the array to sort it. The process is similar to sorting pancakes by size using a spatula, where you can flip the top `k` pancakes at a time.\n\n   The steps for pancake sorting are:\n   - Find the largest unsorted element in the list.\n   - Flip the list up to that element to bring it to the front.\n   - Flip the entire unsorted portion of the list to move the largest element to its correct position at the end.\n   - Reduce the size of the unsorted portion and repeat until the list is sorted.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function pancake_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       for i from n to 1:\n           max_index = find the index of the maximum element in arr[0:i]\n           if max_index != i-1:\n               flip(arr, max_index + 1)  // Bring the max element to the front\n               flip(arr, i)              // Move the max element to its correct position\n       return arr\n\n   function flip(arr, k):\n       reverse the first k elements of arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef flip(arr, k):\n    # Reverse the first k elements of the array\n    left = 0\n    right = k - 1\n    while left < right:\n        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n\ndef pancake_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Iterate from the end of the list to the beginning\n    for i in range(n, 1, -1):\n        # Find the index of the maximum element in the unsorted portion\n        max_index = 0\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            if arr[j] > arr[max_index]:\n                max_index = j\n        # If the maximum element is not already in its correct position\n        if max_index != i - 1:\n            # Flip the maximum element to the front\n            flip(arr, max_index + 1)\n            # Flip it to its correct position\n            flip(arr, i)\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the pancake sorting algorithm, which sorts the list by repeatedly flipping sublists to move the largest unsorted element to its correct position."
