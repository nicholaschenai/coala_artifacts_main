1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function called `pancake_sort` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   The problem suggests using a sorting algorithm, and given the function name `pancake_sort`, it implies using the pancake sorting algorithm. Pancake sorting involves repeatedly flipping sublists of the array to sort it. The process is similar to sorting pancakes by size using a spatula, where you can flip the top `k` pancakes at a time.

   The steps for pancake sorting are:
   - Find the largest unsorted element in the list.
   - Flip the list up to that element to bring it to the front.
   - Flip the entire unsorted portion of the list to move the largest element to its correct position at the end.
   - Reduce the size of the unsorted portion and repeat until the list is sorted.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function pancake_sort(arr):
       n = length of arr
       for i from n to 1:
           max_index = find the index of the maximum element in arr[0:i]
           if max_index != i-1:
               flip(arr, max_index + 1)  // Bring the max element to the front
               flip(arr, i)              // Move the max element to its correct position
       return arr

   function flip(arr, k):
       reverse the first k elements of arr
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def flip(arr, k):
    # Reverse the first k elements of the array
    left = 0
    right = k - 1
    while left < right:
        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1

def pancake_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Iterate from the end of the list to the beginning
    for i in range(n, 1, -1):
        # Find the index of the maximum element in the unsorted portion
        max_index = 0
        for j in range(1, i):
            if arr[j] > arr[max_index]:
                max_index = j
        # If the maximum element is not already in its correct position
        if max_index != i - 1:
            # Flip the maximum element to the front
            flip(arr, max_index + 1)
            # Flip it to its correct position
            flip(arr, i)
    return arr
```
