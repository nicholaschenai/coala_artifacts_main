    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but they start with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The sequence is defined as follows:\n   - L(0) = 2\n   - L(1) = 1\n   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth Lucas number, we can use a simple iterative approach. We start with the first two Lucas numbers, 2 and 1. Then, for each subsequent number up to n, we calculate it by summing the two preceding numbers in the sequence. This approach is efficient and avoids the overhead of recursion.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_lucas(n):\n       if n == 0:\n           return 2\n       if n == 1:\n           return 1\n       initialize two variables, a = 2 and b = 1\n       for i from 2 to n:\n           calculate the next Lucas number as a + b\n           update a to b\n           update b to the newly calculated Lucas number\n       return b\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_lucas(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base cases for the first two Lucas numbers\n    if n == 0:\n        return 2\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two Lucas numbers\n    a, b = 2, 1\n    \n    # Calculate Lucas numbers iteratively up to the nth number\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the next Lucas number\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    \n    # Return the nth Lucas number\n    return b\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `find_lucas` which calculates the nth Lucas number using an iterative approach. It handles the base cases for n = 0 and n = 1, and then iteratively computes the sequence for larger n.",
