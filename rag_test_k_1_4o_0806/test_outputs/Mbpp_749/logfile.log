INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/749 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a list of strings, where each string represents a number. The function should convert these strings to integers, sort them in ascending order, and return the sorted list of integers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Convert Strings to Integers**: First, we need to convert each string in the list to an integer. This will allow us to sort them numerically rather than lexicographically (which is how strings are sorted by default).
   
2. **Sort the List**: Once we have a list of integers, we can sort it using Python's built-in sorting functionality, which sorts numbers in ascending order by default.

3. **Return the Sorted List**: Finally, we return the sorted list of integers.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `sort_numeric_strings` that takes a list of strings as input.
2. Convert each string in the list to an integer.
3. Sort the list of integers.
4. Return the sorted list.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def sort_numeric_strings(lst: list) -> list:
    # Convert each string in the list to an integer
    int_list = [int(num) for num in lst]
    
    # Sort the list of integers
    int_list.sort()
    
    # Return the sorted list
    return int_list
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the conceptual solution and pseudocode. It uses list comprehension to convert the strings to integers and the `sort()` method to sort the list. The function then returns the sorted list of integers.

    \index{sorting}

    \key{Sorting}
    is a fundamental algorithm design problem.
    Many efficient algorithms
    use sorting as a subroutine,
    because it is often easier to process
    data if the elements are in a sorted order.

    For example, the problem ''does an array contain
    two equal elements?'' is easy to solve using sorting.
    If the array contains two equal elements,
    they will be next to each other after sorting,
    so it is easy to find them.
    Also, the problem ''what is the most frequent element
    in an array?'' can be solved similarly.

    There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are
    also good examples of how to apply
    different algorithm design techniques.
    The efficient general sorting algorithms
    work in $O(n \log n)$ time,
    and many algorithms that use sorting
    as a subroutine also
    have this time complexity.

    \section{Sorting theory}

    The basic problem in sorting is as follows:
    \begin{framed}
    \noindent
    Given an array that contains $n$ elements,
    your task is to sort the elements
    in increasing order.
    \end{framed}
    \noindent
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    will be as follows after sorting:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{$O(n^2)$ algorithms}

    \index{bubble sort}

    Simple algorithms for sorting an array
    work in $O(n^2)$ time.
    Such algorithms are short and usually
    consist of two nested loops.
    A famous $O(n^2)$ time sorting algorithm
    is \key{bubble sort} where the elements
    ''bubble'' in the array according to their values.

    Bubble sort consists of $n$ rounds.
    On each round, the algorithm iterates through
    the elements of the array.
    Whenever two consecutive elements are found
    that are not in correct order,
    the algorithm swaps them.
    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) {
            if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
                swap(array[j],array[j+1]);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    After the first round of the algorithm,
    the largest element will be in the correct position,
    and in general, after $k$ rounds, the $k$ largest
    elements will be in the correct positions.
    Thus, after $n$ rounds, the whole array
    will be sorted.

    For example, in the array

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \noindent
    the first round of bubble sort swaps elements
    as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Inversions}

    \index{inversion}

    Bubble sort is an example of a sorting
    algorithm that always swaps \emph{consecutive}
    elements in the array.
    It turns out that the time complexity
    of such an algorithm is \emph{always}
    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,
    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.

    A useful concept when analyzing sorting
    algorithms is an \key{inversion}:
    a pair of array elements
    $(\texttt{array}[a],\texttt{array}[b])$ such that
    $a<b$ and $\texttt{array}[a]>\texttt{array}[b]$,
    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    has three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.
    The number of inversions indicates
    how much work is needed to sort the array.
    An array is completely sorted when
    there are no inversions.
    On the other hand, if the array elements
    are in the reverse order,
    the number of inversions is the largest possible:
    \[1+2+\cdots+(n-1)=\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\]

    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are
    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion
    from the array.
    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only
    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes
    at most one inversion, and the time complexity
    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{$O(n \log n)$ algorithms}

    \index{merge sort}

    It is possible to sort an array efficiently
    in $O(n \log n)$ time using algorithms
    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.
    One such algorithm is \key{merge sort}\footnote{According to \cite{knu983},
    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},
    which is based on recursion.

    Merge sort sorts a subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$ as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.
    \item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\lfloor (a+b)/2 \rfloor$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$.
    \item \emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and
    \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    into a sorted subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$.
    \end{enumerate}

    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it
    halves the size of the subarray at each step.
    The recursion consists of $O(\log n)$ levels,
    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.
    Merging the subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.

    For example, consider sorting the following array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9
