    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth centered hexagonal number. The centered hexagonal number is a type of figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center in a hexagonal pattern. The task is to find the value of the nth centered hexagonal number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Centered hexagonal numbers can be calculated using a specific formula. The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the formula: \\(3n(n-1) + 1\\). This formula arises from the pattern of dots in the hexagonal arrangement. For each layer added to the hexagon, the number of dots increases by 6 times the layer number minus 1. Using this formula, we can directly compute the nth centered hexagonal number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function centered_hexagonal_number(n):\n       Calculate the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula: 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n       Return the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula: 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth centered hexagonal number by applying the formula directly.",
