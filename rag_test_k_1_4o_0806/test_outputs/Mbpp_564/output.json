    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and counts the number of unique unordered pairs where both elements in the pair are different.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each possible pair of elements in the list and count those pairs where the two elements are not equal. Since the pairs are unordered, we need to ensure that we don't count the same pair twice. This can be achieved by only considering pairs where the first element comes before the second element in the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter to zero.\n   For each element in the list (indexed by i):\n       For each subsequent element in the list (indexed by j):\n           If the element at i is not equal to the element at j:\n               Increment the counter.\n   Return the counter.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_Pairs(lst: list, n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of valid pairs\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list using index i\n    for i in range(n):\n        # For each element at index i, iterate over the subsequent elements using index j\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            # Check if the elements at index i and j are not equal\n            if lst[i] != lst[j]:\n                # If they are not equal, increment the counter\n                count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of valid pairs\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each possible pair of elements in the list and counts those pairs where the two elements are different, ensuring that each pair is only counted once by only considering pairs where the first element comes before the second element in the list.",
