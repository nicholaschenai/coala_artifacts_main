INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/280 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given element is present in a list. If the element is found, the function should return a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it should return a tuple with `False` and `-1`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Iterate through the list using a loop.
   - For each element in the list, check if it matches the target element.
   - If a match is found, return `True` and the current index.
   - If the loop completes without finding the element, return `False` and `-1`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sequential_search(array, element):
       for index from 0 to length of array - 1:
           if array[index] is equal to element:
               return (True, index)
       return (False, -1)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sequential_search(array, element):
    # Iterate over the array with index
    for index in range(len(array)):
        # Check if the current element matches the target element
        if array[index] == element:
            # If found, return True and the index
            return (True, index)
    # If not found, return False and -1
    return (False, -1)
```

This solution iterates through the list, checking each element against the target. If it finds the target, it returns `True` and the index. If it doesn't find the target, it returns `False` and `-1`.

    \index{binary search}

    A general method for searching for an element
    in an array is to use a \texttt{for} loop
    that iterates through the elements of the array.
    For example, the following code searches for
    an element $x$ in an array:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (array[i] == x) {
            // x found at index i
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$,
    because in the worst case, it is necessary to check
    all elements of the array.
    If the order of the elements is arbitrary,
    this is also the best possible approach, because
    there is no additional information available where
    in the array we should search for the element $x$.

    However, if the array is \emph{sorted},
    the situation is different.
    In this case it is possible to perform the
    search much faster, because the order of the
    elements in the array guides the search.
    The following \key{binary search} algorithm
    efficiently searches for an element in a sorted array
    in $O(\log n)$ time.

    \subsubsection{Method 1}

    The usual way to implement binary search
    resembles looking for a word in a dictionary.
    The search maintains an active region in the array,
    which initially contains all array elements.
    Then, a number of steps is performed,
    each of which halves the size of the region.

    At each step, the search checks the middle element
    of the active region.
    If the middle element is the target element,
    the search terminates.
    Otherwise, the search recursively continues
    to the left or right half of the region,
    depending on the value of the middle element.

    The above idea can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a = 0, b = n-1;
    while (a <= b) {
        int k = (a+b)/2;
        if (array[k] == x) {
            // x found at index k
        }
        if (array[k] > x) b = k-1;
        else a = k+1;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    In this implementation, the active region is $a \ldots b$,
    and initially the region is $0 \ldots n-1$.
    The algorithm halves the size of the region at each step,
    so the time complexity is $O(\log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Method 2}

    An alternative method to implement binary search
    is based on an efficient way to iterate through
    the elements of the array.
    The idea is to make jumps and slow the speed
    when we get closer to the target element.

    The search goes through the array from left to
    right, and the initial jump length is $n/2$.
    At each step, the jump length will be halved:
    first $n/4$, then $n/8$, $n/16$, etc., until
    finally the length is 1.
    After the jumps, either the target element has
    been found or we know that it does not appear in the array.

    The following code implements the above idea:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int k = 0;
    for (int b = n/2; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (k+b < n && array[k+b] <= x) k += b;
    }
    if (array[k] == x) {
        // x found at index k
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    During the search, the variable $b$
    contains the current jump length.
    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(\log n)$,
    because the code in the \texttt{while} loop
    is performed at most twice for each jump length.

    \subsubsection{C++ functions}

    The C++ standard library contains the following functions
    that are based on binary search and work in logarithmic time:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{lower\_bound} returns a pointer to the
    first array element whose value is at least $x$.
    \item \texttt{upper\_bound} returns a pointer to the
    first array element whose value is larger than $x$.
    \item \texttt{equal\_range} returns both above pointers.
    \end{itemize}

    The functions assume that the array is sorted.
    If there is no such element, the pointer points to
    the element after the last array element.
    For example, the following code finds out whether
    an array contains an element with value $x$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto k = lower_bound(array,array+n,x)-array;
    if (k < n && array[k] == x) {
        // x found at index k
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Then, the following code counts the number of elements
    whose value is $x$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto a = lower_bound(array, array+n, x);
    auto b = upper_bound(array, array+n, x);
    cout << b-a << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    Using \texttt{equal\_range}, the code becomes shorter:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto r = equal_range(array, array+n, x);
    cout << r.second-r.first << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Finding the smallest solution}

    An important use for binary search is
    to find the position where the value of a \emph{function} changes.
    Suppose that we wish to find the smallest value $k$
    that is a valid solution for a problem.
    We are given a function $\texttt{ok}(x)$
    that returns \texttt{true} if $x$ is a valid solution
    and \texttt{false} otherwise.
    In addition, we know that $\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \texttt{false}
    when $x<k$ and \texttt{true} when $x \ge k$.
    The situation looks as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrr}
    $x$ & 0 & 1 & $\cdots$ & $k-1$ & $k$ & $k+1$ & $\cdots$ \\
    \hline
    $\texttt{ok}(x)$ & \texttt{false} & \texttt{false}
    & $\cdots$ & \texttt{false} & \texttt{true} & \texttt{true} & $\cdots$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \noindent
    Now, the value of $k$ can be found using binary search:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int x = -1;
    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (!ok(x+b)) x += b;
    }
    int k = x+1;
    \end{lstlisting}

    The search finds the largest value of $x$ for which
    $\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \texttt{false}.
    Thus, the next value $k=x+1$
    is the smallest possible value for which
    $\texttt{ok}(k)$ is \texttt{true}.
    The initial jump length $z$ has to be
    large enough, for example some value
    for which we know beforehand that $\texttt{ok}(z)$ is \texttt{true}.

    The algorithm calls the function \texttt{ok}
    $O(\log z)$ times, so the total time complexity
    depends on the function \texttt{ok}.
    For example, if the function works in $O(n)$ time,
    the total time complexity is $O(n \log z)$.

    \subsubsection{Finding the maximum value}

    Binary search can also be used to find
    the maximum value for a function that is
    first increasing and then decreasing.
    Our task is to find a position $k$ such that

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    $f(x)<f(x+1)$ when $x<k$, and
    \item
    $f(x)>f(x+1)$ when $x \ge k$.
    \end{itemize}

    The idea is to use binary search
    for finding the largest value of $x$
    for which $f(x)<f(x+1)$.
    This implies that $k=x+1$
    because $f(x+1)>f(x+2)$.
    The following code implements the search: 

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int x = -1;
    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (f(x+b) < f(x+b+1)) x += b;
    }
    int k = x+1;
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that unlike in the ordinary binary search,
    here it is not allowed that consecutive values
    of the function are equal.
    In this case it would not be possible to know
    how to continue the search.

   We need to create a function that takes a list and an element as inputs. The function should return a tuple. The first element of the tuple is a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the list. The second element of the tuple is the index of the element in the list if it is present, or -1 if it is not.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   We will iterate through the list using a loop. For each element in the list, we will check if it matches the given element. If we find a match, we will return `True` and the index of the element. If we finish checking all elements and do not find a match, we will return `False` and -1.
