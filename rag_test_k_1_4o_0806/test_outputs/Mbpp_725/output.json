    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the substrings that are enclosed in double quotation marks. The function should return these substrings as a list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and look for double quotation marks. When we find an opening quotation mark, we continue to collect characters until we find the closing quotation mark. The collected characters form a substring that we add to our result list. We repeat this process until we have processed the entire string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty list to store the extracted substrings.\n   Initialize a variable to keep track of whether we are inside a quotation.\n   Initialize an empty string to build the current substring.\n\n   For each character in the input string:\n       If the character is a double quotation mark:\n           If we are inside a quotation:\n               Add the current substring to the list.\n               Reset the current substring.\n               Set the inside quotation flag to False.\n           Else:\n               Set the inside quotation flag to True.\n       Else if we are inside a quotation:\n           Add the character to the current substring.\n\n   Return the list of extracted substrings.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_quotation(s: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted substrings\n    result = []\n    # Flag to track if we are inside a quotation\n    inside_quotation = False\n    # String to build the current substring\n    current_substring = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is a double quotation mark\n        if char == '\"':\n            # If we are inside a quotation, it means we found the closing quote\n            if inside_quotation:\n                # Add the current substring to the result list\n                result.append(current_substring)\n                # Reset the current substring\n                current_substring = \"\"\n                # Set the flag to indicate we are no longer inside a quotation\n                inside_quotation = False\n            else:\n                # Set the flag to indicate we are now inside a quotation\n                inside_quotation = True\n        # If we are inside a quotation, add the character to the current substring\n        elif inside_quotation:\n            current_substring += char\n\n    # Return the list of extracted substrings\n    return result\n```",
