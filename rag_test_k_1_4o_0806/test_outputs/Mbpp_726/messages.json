        "content": "Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input. The function should return a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. Specifically, for an input tuple `(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{N+1})`, the output should be a tuple `(t_1 * t_2, t_2 * t_3, ..., t_N * t_{N+1})`.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we will:\n- Initialize an empty list to store the products of consecutive elements.\n- Iterate over the input tuple, stopping one element before the last.\n- For each element at index `i`, multiply it with the element at index `i+1`.\n- Append the result of each multiplication to the list.\n- Convert the list of products to a tuple and return it.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction multiply_elements(input_tuple):\n    initialize an empty list called products\n    for each index i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:\n        calculate product of input_tuple[i] and input_tuple[i+1]\n        append the product to products list\n    convert products list to a tuple\n    return the tuple\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef multiply_elements(input_tuple):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the products\n    products = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the input tuple, stopping before the last element\n    for i in range(len(input_tuple) - 1):\n        # Calculate the product of the current element and the next element\n        product = input_tuple[i] * input_tuple[i + 1]\n        # Append the product to the products list\n        products.append(product)\n    \n    # Convert the list of products to a tuple\n    result_tuple = tuple(products)\n    \n    # Return the resulting tuple\n    return result_tuple\n```\n\nThis code will take a tuple of numbers as input and return a tuple of products of consecutive elements, as specified in the problem statement."
