An inversion is a pair of elements in the array such that the first element is greater than the second element, and the first element appears before the second element in the array.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To count inversions in an array, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The merge sort algorithm is efficient for this task because it divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and counts inversions during the merge step. The key idea is that when merging two sorted subarrays, if an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, then all remaining elements in the left subarray form inversions with this element.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n       i = left\n       j = mid + 1\n       k = left\n       inv_count = 0\n\n       while i <= mid and j <= right:\n           if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n               temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n               i += 1\n           else:\n               temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n               inv_count += (mid - i + 1)\n               j += 1\n           k += 1\n\n       while i <= mid:\n           temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n           i += 1\n           k += 1\n\n       while j <= right:\n           temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n           j += 1\n           k += 1\n\n       for i from left to right:\n           arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n       return inv_count\n\n   function merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n       inv_count = 0\n       if left < right:\n           mid = (left + right) // 2\n           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n           inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n       return inv_count\n\n   function get_Inv_Count(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       temp_arr = array of size n\n       return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, n - 1)\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n    i = left    # Starting index for left subarray\n    j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray\n    k = left    # Starting index to be sorted\n    inv_count = 0\n\n    # Conditions are checked to ensure that i doesn't exceed mid and j doesn't exceed right\n    while i <= mid and j <= right:\n        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            # There are mid - i inversions, because all elements left to i in the left subarray\n            # are greater than arr[j]\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n            inv_count += (mid - i + 1)\n            j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the remaining elements of left subarray, if any\n    while i <= mid:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n        i += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the remaining elements of right subarray, if any\n    while j <= right:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n        j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    # Copy the sorted subarray into Original array\n    for i in range(left, right + 1):\n        arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n    return inv_count\n\ndef merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n    inv_count = 0\n    if left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n        inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n\n    return inv_count\n\ndef get_Inv_Count(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    temp_arr = [0] * n\n    return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, n - 1)\n```\n\nThis solution uses a modified merge sort to efficiently count inversions in the array, achieving a time complexity of O(n log n)."

out that this is \\emph{not} possible\n    when we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms\n    that are based on comparing array elements.\n\n    The lower bound for the time complexity\n    can be proved by considering sorting\n    as a process where each comparison of two elements\n    gives more information about the contents of the array.\n    The process creates the following tree:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) rectangle (3,1);\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (-2.5,-1.5);\n    \\draw[thick,->]

$x<y$, the process continues to the left,\n    and otherwise to the right.\n    The results of the process are the possible\n    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.\n    For this reason, the height of the tree\n    must be at least\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) = \\log_2(1)+\\log_2(2)+\\cdots+\\log_2(n).\\]\n    We get a lower bound for this sum\n    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and\n    changing the value of each element to $\\log_2(n/2)$.\n    This yields an estimate\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) \\ge (n/2) \\cdot \\log_2(n/2),\\]\n    so the height of the tree and the minimum\n    possible number of steps in a sorting\n    algorithm in the worst case\n    is at least $n \\log n$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Counting sort}\n\n    \\index{counting sort}\n\n    The lower bound $n \\log n$ does not apply to\n    algorithms that do not compare array elements\n    but use some other information.\n    An example of such an algorithm is\n    \\key{counting sort} that sorts an array in\n    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array\n    is an integer between $0 \\ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.\n\n    The algorithm creates a \\emph{bookkeeping} array,\n    whose indices are elements of the original array.\n    The algorithm iterates through the original array\n    and calculates how many times each element\n    appears in the array.\n    \\newpage\n\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at

corresponds to the following bookkeeping array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (9,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5)

example, the value at position 3\n    in the bookkeeping array is 2,\n    because the element 3 appears 2 times\n    in the original array.\n\n    Construction of the bookkeeping array\n    takes $O(n)$ time. After this, the sorted array\n    can be created in $O(n)$ time because\n    the number of occurrences of each element can be retrieved\n    from the bookkeeping array.\n    Thus, the total time complexity of counting\n    sort is $O(n)$.\n\n    Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm\n    but it can only be used when the constant $c$\n    is small enough, so that the array elements can\n    be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
