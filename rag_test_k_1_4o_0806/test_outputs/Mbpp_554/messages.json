We will iterate through each integer in the input list.\n2. For each integer, we will check if it is odd. An integer is odd if the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero.\n3. If the integer is odd, we will add it to a new list.\n4. Finally, we will return the new list containing only the odd integers.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction Split(numbers):\n    create an empty list called odd_numbers\n    for each number in numbers:\n        if number is odd (number % 2 != 0):\n            add number to odd_numbers\n    return odd_numbers\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef Split(numbers):\n    # Create an empty list to store odd numbers\n    odd_numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            # Add the odd number to the odd_numbers list\n            odd_numbers.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of odd numbers\n    return odd_numbers\n```"
