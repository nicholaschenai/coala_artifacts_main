INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/554 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through each integer in the input list.
2. For each integer, we will check if it is odd. An integer is odd if the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero.
3. If the integer is odd, we will add it to a new list.
4. Finally, we will return the new list containing only the odd integers.

### Pseudocode

```
function Split(numbers):
    create an empty list called odd_numbers
    for each number in numbers:
        if number is odd (number % 2 != 0):
            add number to odd_numbers
    return odd_numbers
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def Split(numbers):
    # Create an empty list to store odd numbers
    odd_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is odd
        if number % 2 != 0:
            # Add the odd number to the odd_numbers list
            odd_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the list of odd numbers
    return odd_numbers
```
