    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find two numbers in a list of integers such that their product is the highest possible among all pairs of numbers in the list. The function should return this pair of numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible pairs of numbers in the list, calculate their product, and keep track of the pair with the highest product. We will initialize a variable to store the maximum product found so far and update it whenever we find a pair with a higher product. Finally, we return the pair that gives the maximum product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize max_product to a very small number\n   Initialize max_pair to None\n\n   For each number i in the list:\n       For each number j in the list after i:\n           Calculate the product of i and j\n           If the product is greater than max_product:\n               Update max_product with this product\n               Update max_pair with the pair (i, j)\n\n   Return max_pair\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_Product(arr):\n    # Initialize max_product to a very small number\n    max_product = float('-inf')\n    # Initialize max_pair to None\n    max_pair = None\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the array\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Iterate over each element after the current element\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):\n            # Calculate the product of the current pair\n            product = arr[i] * arr[j]\n            # If this product is greater than the current max_product\n            if product > max_product:\n                # Update max_product with this product\n                max_product = product\n                # Update max_pair with the current pair\n                max_pair = (arr[i], arr[j])\n\n    # Return the pair with the maximum product\n    return max_pair\n```",
