    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with the numbers sorted in increasing order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   We can use the Comb Sort algorithm, which is an improvement over Bubble Sort. Comb Sort works by comparing elements that are a certain gap apart and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The gap starts as the length of the list and is reduced by a shrink factor in each iteration until it becomes 1, at which point it behaves like Bubble Sort. This approach helps to eliminate small values near the end of the list and large values near the beginning more quickly than Bubble Sort.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function comb_sort(arr):\n       set gap to length of arr\n       set shrink factor to 1.3\n       set sorted to False\n       \n       while gap > 1 or sorted is False:\n           set gap to max(1, int(gap / shrink factor))\n           set sorted to True\n           \n           for i from 0 to length of arr - gap:\n               if arr[i] > arr[i + gap]:\n                   swap arr[i] and arr[i + gap]\n                   set sorted to False\n                   \n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef comb_sort(arr):\n    # Initialize the gap to the length of the array\n    gap = len(arr)\n    # Define the shrink factor\n    shrink = 1.3\n    # Initialize the sorted flag to False\n    sorted = False\n    \n    # Continue the loop until the gap is 1 and the array is sorted\n    while gap > 1 or not sorted:\n        # Update the gap for the next iteration\n        gap = max(1, int(gap / shrink))\n        # Assume the array is sorted\n        sorted = True\n        \n        # Compare elements with the current gap\n        for i in range(len(arr) - gap):\n            if arr[i] > arr[i + gap]:\n                # Swap if they are in the wrong order\n                arr[i], arr[i + gap] = arr[i + gap], arr[i]\n                # Since we made a swap, the array might not be sorted\n                sorted = False\n    \n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the Comb Sort algorithm, which is an efficient sorting method that improves upon Bubble Sort by initially using a larger gap between compared elements and gradually reducing it.",
