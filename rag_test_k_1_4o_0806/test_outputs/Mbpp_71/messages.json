        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to implement a function that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using the comb sort algorithm. The function should take a list of integers as input and return a new list with the integers sorted.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Comb sort is an improvement over the bubble sort algorithm. It works by comparing elements that are a certain gap apart and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The gap starts as the length of the list and is reduced by a shrink factor (commonly 1.3) until it becomes 1, at which point the algorithm behaves like a bubble sort. The process continues until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function comb_sort that takes a list as input.\n   Initialize the gap as the length of the list.\n   Set the shrink factor to 1.3.\n   Set a boolean variable 'sorted' to False.\n   \n   While the gap is greater than 1 or the list is not sorted:\n       Update the gap by dividing it by the shrink factor and taking the floor of the result.\n       If the gap is less than 1, set it to 1.\n       \n       Set 'sorted' to True.\n       \n       For each index i from 0 to the length of the list minus the gap:\n           If the element at index i is greater than the element at index i + gap:\n               Swap the elements at index i and i + gap.\n               Set 'sorted' to False.\n   \n   Return the sorted list.\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef comb_sort(arr):\n    # Initialize the gap as the length of the list\n    gap = len(arr)\n    # Define the shrink factor\n    shrink_factor = 1.3\n    # Initialize the sorted flag\n    sorted = False\n    \n    # Continue until the gap is 1 and the list is sorted\n    while gap > 1 or not sorted:\n        # Update the gap for the next comb\n        gap = int(gap // shrink_factor)\n        if gap < 1:\n            gap = 1\n        \n        # Assume the list is sorted\n        sorted = True\n        \n        # Compare elements with the current gap\n        for i in range(len(arr) - gap):\n            if arr[i] > arr[i + gap]:\n                # Swap if they are in the wrong order\n                arr[i], arr[i + gap] = arr[i + gap], arr[i]\n                # Since we made a swap, the list might not be sorted\n                sorted = False\n    \n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the comb sort algorithm, which is an efficient sorting algorithm that improves upon bubble sort by initially comparing elements that are far apart and then reducing the gap between compared elements."
