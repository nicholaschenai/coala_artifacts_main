    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function called `heap_sort` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order. The function should use the heap sort algorithm to perform the sorting.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. It involves two main steps:\n   - **Build a max heap** from the input data. A max heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.\n   - **Extract elements from the heap** one by one, and place them at the end of the array. This is done by repeatedly removing the root of the heap (the largest element) and then rebuilding the heap with the remaining elements.\n\n   The process of heapifying ensures that the largest element is always at the root of the heap, and by swapping it with the last element and reducing the heap size, we effectively sort the array.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function heapify(arr, n, i):\n       largest = i\n       left = 2 * i + 1\n       right = 2 * i + 2\n\n       if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:\n           largest = left\n\n       if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:\n           largest = right\n\n       if largest != i:\n           swap arr[i] and arr[largest]\n           heapify(arr, n, largest)\n\n   function heap_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n\n       for i from n/2 - 1 down to 0:\n           heapify(arr, n, i)\n\n       for i from n-1 down to 0:\n           swap arr[0] and arr[i]\n           heapify(arr, i, 0)\n\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef heapify(arr, n, i):\n    # Initialize largest as root\n    largest = i\n    left = 2 * i + 1  # left = 2*i + 1\n    right = 2 * i + 2  # right = 2*i + 2\n\n    # If left child is larger than root\n    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:\n        largest = left\n\n    # If right child is larger than largest so far\n    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:\n        largest = right\n\n    # If largest is not root\n    if largest != i:\n        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]  # swap\n\n        # Recursively heapify the affected sub-tree\n        heapify(arr, n, largest)\n\ndef heap_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n\n    # Build a maxheap\n    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):\n        heapify(arr, n, i)\n\n    # One by one extract elements\n    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):\n        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]  # swap\n        heapify(arr, i, 0)\n\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the heap sort algorithm, which sorts the input list in ascending order by first building a max heap and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element and rebuilding the heap.",
