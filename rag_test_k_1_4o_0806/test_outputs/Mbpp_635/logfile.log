INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/635 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to implement a function called `heap_sort` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order. The function should use the heap sort algorithm to achieve this.

### Conceptual Solution

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. The algorithm consists of two main phases:

1. **Build a Max Heap**: Convert the input list into a max heap, where the largest element is at the root of the heap.

2. **Sort the List**: Repeatedly extract the maximum element from the heap and place it at the end of the list. Then, reduce the size of the heap by one and heapify the root element to maintain the max heap property.

The process of heapifying involves ensuring that a subtree rooted at a given index satisfies the max heap property, where each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a helper function `heapify(arr, n, i)`:
   - Set `largest` as `i`.
   - Calculate `left` as `2 * i + 1` and `right` as `2 * i + 2`.
   - If `left` is within bounds and `arr[left]` is greater than `arr[largest]`, update `largest` to `left`.
   - If `right` is within bounds and `arr[right]` is greater than `arr[largest]`, update `largest` to `right`.
   - If `largest` is not `i`, swap `arr[i]` and `arr[largest]`, and recursively call `heapify` on the affected subtree.

2. Define the main function `heap_sort(arr)`:
   - Get the length of the list `n`.
   - Build a max heap by calling `heapify` for all non-leaf nodes from `n//2 - 1` to `0`.
   - For each element from `n-1` to `1`:
     - Swap the root of the heap with the current element.
     - Reduce the heap size by one.
     - Call `heapify` on the root to maintain the max heap property.

3. Return the sorted list.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def heapify(arr, n, i):
    # Initialize largest as root
    largest = i
    left = 2 * i + 1  # left = 2*i + 1
    right = 2 * i + 2  # right = 2*i + 2

    # If left child is larger than root
    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:
        largest = left

    # If right child is larger than largest so far
    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:
        largest = right

    # If largest is not root
    if largest != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]  # swap

        # Recursively heapify the affected sub-tree
        heapify(arr, n, largest)

def heap_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Build a maxheap
    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):
        heapify(arr, n, i)

    # One by one extract elements
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]  # swap
        heapify(arr, i, 0)

    return arr
```

This code implements the heap sort algorithm by first building a max heap and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element to sort the list.

    \index{sorting}

    \key{Sorting}
    is a fundamental algorithm design problem.
    Many efficient algorithms
    use sorting as a subroutine,
    because it is often easier to process
    data if the elements are in a sorted order.

    For example, the problem ''does an array contain
    two equal elements?'' is easy to solve using sorting.
    If the array contains two equal elements,
    they will be next to each other after sorting,
    so it is easy to find them.
    Also, the problem ''what is the most frequent element
    in an array?'' can be solved similarly.

    There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are
    also good examples of how to apply
    different algorithm design techniques.
    The efficient general sorting algorithms
    work in $O(n \log n)$ time,
    and many algorithms that use sorting
    as a subroutine also
    have this time complexity.

    \section{Sorting theory}

    The basic problem in sorting is as follows:
    \begin{framed}
    \noindent
    Given an array that contains $n$ elements,
    your task is to sort the elements
    in increasing order.
    \end{framed}
    \noindent
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    will be as follows after sorting:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{$O(n^2)$ algorithms}

    \index{bubble sort}

    Simple algorithms for sorting an array
    work in $O(n^2)$ time.
    Such algorithms are short and usually
    consist of two nested loops.
    A famous $O(n^2)$ time sorting algorithm
    is \key{bubble sort} where the elements
    ''bubble'' in the array according to their values.

    Bubble sort consists of $n$ rounds.
    On each round, the algorithm iterates through
    the elements of the array.
    Whenever two consecutive elements are found
    that are not in correct order,
    the algorithm swaps them.
    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) {
            if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
                swap(array[j],array[j+1]);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    After the first round of the algorithm,
    the largest element will be in the correct position,
    and in general, after $k$ rounds, the $k$ largest
    elements will be in the correct positions.
    Thus, after $n$ rounds, the whole array
    will be sorted.

    For example, in the array

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \noindent
    the first round of bubble sort swaps elements
    as follows:

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Inversions}

    \index{inversion}

    Bubble sort is an example of a sorting
    algorithm that always swaps \emph{consecutive}
    elements in the array.
    It turns out that the time complexity
    of such an algorithm is \emph{always}
    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,
    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.

    A useful concept when analyzing sorting
    algorithms is an \key{inversion}:
    a pair of array elements
    $(\texttt{array}[a],\texttt{array}[b])$ such that
    $a<b$ and $\texttt{array}[a]>\texttt{array}[b]$,
    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    has three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.
    The number of inversions indicates
    how much work is needed to sort the array.
    An array is completely sorted when
    there are no inversions.
    On the other hand, if the array elements
    are in the reverse order,
    the number of inversions is the largest possible:
    \[1+2+\cdots+(n-1)=\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\]

    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are
    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion
    from the array.
    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only
    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes
    at most one inversion, and the time complexity
    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{$O(n \log n)$ algorithms}

    \index{merge sort}

    It is possible to sort an array efficiently
    in $O(n \log n)$ time using algorithms
    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.
    One such algorithm is \key{merge sort}\footnote{According to \cite{knu983},
    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},
    which is based on recursion.

    Merge sort sorts a subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$ as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.
    \item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\lfloor (a+b)/2 \rfloor$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$.
    \item \emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and
    \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    into a sorted subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$.
    \end{enumerate}

    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it
    halves the size of the subarray at each step.
    The recursion consists of $O(\log n)$ levels,
    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.
    Merging the subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.

    For example, consider sorting the following array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/635 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function called `heap_sort` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order. The function should use the heap sort algorithm to perform the sorting.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. It involves two main steps:
   - **Build a max heap** from the input data. A max heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
   - **Extract elements from the heap** one by one, and place them at the end of the array. This is done by repeatedly removing the root of the heap (the largest element) and then rebuilding the heap with the remaining elements.

   The process of heapifying ensures that the largest element is always at the root of the heap, and by swapping it with the last element and reducing the heap size, we effectively sort the array.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function heapify(arr, n, i):
       largest = i
       left = 2 * i + 1
       right = 2 * i + 2

       if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:
           largest = left

       if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:
           largest = right

       if largest != i:
           swap arr[i] and arr[largest]
           heapify(arr, n, largest)

   function heap_sort(arr):
       n = length of arr

       for i from n/2 - 1 down to 0:
           heapify(arr, n, i)

       for i from n-1 down to 0:
           swap arr[0] and arr[i]
           heapify(arr, i, 0)

       return arr
   ```

   - **Extract elements from the heap** one by one, and place them at the end of the array. This is done by repeatedly removing the root of the heap (the largest element) and then rebuilding the heap with the remaining elements.

   The process of heapifying ensures that the largest element is always at the root of the heap, and by swapping it with the last element and reducing the heap size, we effectively sort the array.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function heapify(arr, n, i):
       largest = i
       left = 2 * i + 1
       right = 2 * i + 2

       if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:
           largest = left

       if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:
           largest = right

       if largest != i:
           swap arr[i] and arr[largest]
           heapify(arr, n, largest)

   function heap_sort(arr):
       n = length of arr

       for i from n/2 - 1 down to 0:
           heapify(arr, n, i)

       for i from n-1 down to 0:
           swap arr[0] and arr[i]
           heapify(arr, i, 0)

       return arr
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def heapify(arr, n, i):
    # Initialize largest as root
    largest = i
    left = 2 * i + 1  # left = 2*i + 1
    right = 2 * i + 2  # right = 2*i + 2

    # If left child is larger than root
    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:
        largest = left

    # If right child is larger than largest so far
    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:
        largest = right

    # If largest is not root
    if largest != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]  # swap

        # Recursively heapify the affected sub-tree
        heapify(arr, n, largest)

def heap_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Build a maxheap
    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):
        heapify(arr, n, i)

    # One by one extract elements
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]  # swap
        heapify(arr, i, 0)

    return arr
```

This code implements the heap sort algorithm, which sorts the input list in ascending order by first building a max heap and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element and rebuilding the heap.
