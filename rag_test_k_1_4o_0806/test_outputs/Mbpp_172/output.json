    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts how many times the substring \"std\" appears in a given string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach by iterating through the given string and checking for the occurrence of the substring \"std\". We will slide a window of length 3 (the length of \"std\") across the string and count each time the window matches \"std\". This will give us the total number of occurrences of \"std\" in the string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter to 0\n   For each index i from 0 to the length of the string minus 3:\n       If the substring from index i to i+3 is \"std\":\n           Increment the counter by 1\n   Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_occurance(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences of \"std\"\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the string, stopping 3 characters before the end\n    for i in range(len(s) - 2):\n        # Check if the substring from the current index to the next 3 characters is \"std\"\n        if s[i:i+3] == \"std\":\n            # If it is, increment the counter\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of \"std\" occurrences\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of times \"std\" appears in the input string.",
