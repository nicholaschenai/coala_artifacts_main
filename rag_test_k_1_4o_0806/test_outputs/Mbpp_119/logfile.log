INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/119 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a sorted array where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element that appears only once. Our task is to find and return this unique element.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Since the array is sorted, the elements that appear twice will be adjacent to each other.
2. We can iterate through the array in steps of 2, checking pairs of elements.
3. If a pair of elements are not equal, then the first element of that pair is the unique element.
4. If we reach the end of the array without finding a mismatch, the last element is the unique one.

## Pseudocode

```
function search(arr):
    for i from 0 to length of arr - 1, step by 2:
        if i is the last index or arr[i] is not equal to arr[i + 1]:
            return arr[i]
    return arr[length of arr - 1]
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def search(arr):
    # Iterate through the array in steps of 2
    for i in range(0, len(arr) - 1, 2):
        # If the current element is not equal to the next one, it is the unique element
        if arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:
            return arr[i]
    # If no unique element is found in the loop, the last element is unique
    return arr[-1]

    \index{meet in the middle}

    \key{Meet in the middle} is a technique
    where the search space is divided into
    two parts of about equal size.
    A separate search is performed
    for both of the parts,
    and finally the results of the searches are combined.

    The technique can be used
    if there is an efficient way to combine the
    results of the searches.
    In such a situation, the two searches may require less
    time than one large search.
    Typically, we can turn a factor of $2^n$
    into a factor of $2^{n/2}$ using the meet in the
    middle technique.

    As an example, consider a problem where
    we are given a list of $n$ numbers and
    a number $x$,
    and we want to find out if it is possible
    to choose some numbers from the list so that
    their sum is $x$.
    For example, given the list $[2,4,5,9]$ and $x=15$,
    we can choose the numbers $[2,4,9]$ to get $2+4+9=15$.
    However, if $x=10$ for the same list,
    it is not possible to form the sum.

    A simple algorithm to the problem is to
    go through all subsets of the elements and
    check if the sum of any of the subsets is $x$.
    The running time of such an algorithm is $O(2^n)$,
    because there are $2^n$ subsets.
    However, using the meet in the middle technique,
    we can achieve a more efficient $O(2^{n/2})$ time algorithm\footnote{This
    idea was introduced in 1974 by E. Horowitz and S. Sahni \cite{hor74}.}.
    Note that $O(2^n)$ and $O(2^{n/2})$ are different
    complexities because $2^{n/2}$ equals $\sqrt{2^n}$.

    The idea is to divide the list into
    two lists $A$ and $B$ such that both
    lists contain about half of the numbers.
    The first search generates all subsets
    of $A$ and stores their sums to a list $S_A$.
    Correspondingly, the second search creates
    a list $S_B$ from $B$.
    After this, it suffices to check if it is possible
    to choose one element from $S_A$ and another
    element from $S_B$ such that their sum is $x$.
    This is possible exactly when there is a way to
    form the sum $x$ using the numbers of the original list.

    For example, suppose that the list is $[2,4,5,9]$ and $x=15$.
    First, we divide the list into $A=[2,4]$ and $B=[5,9]$.
    After this, we create lists
    $S_A=[0,2,4,6]$ and $S_B=[0,5,9,14]$.
    In this case, the sum $x=15$ is possible to form,
    because $S_A$ contains the sum $6$,
    $S_B$ contains the sum $9$, and $6+9=15$.
    This corresponds to the solution $[2,4,9]$.

    We can implement the algorithm so that
    its time complexity is $O(2^{n/2})$.
    First, we generate \emph{sorted} lists $S_A$ and $S_B$,
    which can be done in $O(2^{n/2})$ time using a merge-like technique.
    After this, since the lists are sorted,
    we can check in $O(2^{n/2})$ time if
    the sum $x$ can be created from $S_A$ and $S_B$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/119 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the single element in a sorted array where every other element appears exactly twice. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Since the array is sorted and all elements except one appear twice, the unique element will disrupt the pattern of pairs. We can use a binary search approach to efficiently find this unique element. The idea is to check the middle of the array and determine if the unique element is in the left or right half by checking the pairing pattern. If the middle element is part of a pair, the unique element is in the other half. If not, it is in the half where the middle element is located.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function search(arr):
       set low to 0
       set high to length of arr - 1
       
       while low is less than high:
           set mid to (low + high) // 2
           
           if mid is even:
               if arr[mid] is equal to arr[mid + 1]:
                   set low to mid + 2
               else:
