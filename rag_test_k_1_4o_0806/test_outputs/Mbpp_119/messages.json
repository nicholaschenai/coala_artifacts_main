Our task is to find and return this unique element.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Since the array is sorted, the elements that appear twice will be adjacent to each other.\n2. We can iterate through the array in steps of 2, checking pairs of elements.\n3. If a pair of elements are not equal, then the first element of that pair is the unique element.\n4. If we reach the end of the array without finding a mismatch, the last element is the unique one.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction search(arr):\n    for i from 0 to length of arr - 1, step by 2:\n        if i is the last index or arr[i] is not equal to arr[i + 1]:\n            return arr[i]\n    return arr[length of arr - 1]\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef search(arr):\n    # Iterate through the array in steps of 2\n    for i in range(0, len(arr) - 1, 2):\n        # If the current element is not equal to the next one, it is the unique element\n        if arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:\n            return arr[i]\n    # If no unique element is found in the loop, the last element is unique\n    return arr[-1]\n```"

Horowitz and S. Sahni \\cite{hor74}.}.\n    Note that $O(2^n)$ and $O(2^{n/2})$ are different\n    complexities because $2^{n/2}$ equals $\\sqrt{2^n}$.\n\n    The idea is to divide the list into\n    two lists $A$ and $B$ such that both\n    lists contain about half of the numbers.\n    The first search generates all subsets\n    of $A$ and stores their sums to a list $S_A$.\n    Correspondingly, the second search creates\n    a list $S_B$ from $B$.\n    After this, it suffices to check if it is possible\n    to choose one element from $S_A$ and another\n    element from $S_B$ such that their sum is $x$.\n    This is possible exactly when there is a way to\n    form the sum $x$ using the numbers of the original list.\n\n    For example, suppose that the list is $[2,4,5,9]$ and $x=15$.\n    First, we divide the list into $A=[2,4]$ and $B=[5,9]$.\n    After this, we create lists\n    $S_A=[0,2,4,6]$ and $S_B=[0,5,9,14]$.\n    In this case, the sum $x=15$ is possible to form,\n    because $S_A$ contains the sum $6$,\n    $S_B$ contains the sum $9$, and $6+9=15$.\n    This corresponds to the solution $[2,4,9]$.\n\n    We can implement the algorithm so that\n    its time complexity is $O(2^{n/2})$.\n    First, we generate \\emph{sorted} lists $S_A$ and $S_B$,\n    which can be done in $O(2^{n/2})$ time using a merge-like technique.\n    After this, since the lists are sorted,\n    we can check in $O(2^{n/2})$ time if\n    the sum $x$ can be created from $S_A$ and $S_B$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Since the array is sorted and all elements except one appear twice, the unique element will disrupt the pattern of pairs. We can use a binary search approach to efficiently find this unique element. The idea is to check the middle of the array and determine if the unique element is in the left or right half by checking the pairing pattern. If the middle element is part of a pair, the unique element is in the other half. If not, it is in the half where the middle element is located.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function search(arr):\n       set low to 0\n       set high to length of arr - 1\n       \n       while low is less than high:\n           set mid to (low + high) // 2\n           \n           if mid is even:\n               if arr[mid] is equal to arr[mid + 1]:\n                   set low to mid + 2\n               else:\n                   set high to mid\n           else:\n               if arr[mid] is equal to arr[mid - 1]:\n                   set low to mid + 1\n               else:\n                   set high to mid\n       \n       return arr[low]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef search(arr):\n    # Initialize the low and high pointers for binary search\n    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    \n    # Perform binary search\n    while low < high:\n        # Calculate the middle index\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        \n        # Check if mid is even\n        if mid % 2 == 0:\n            # If the element at mid is equal to the next element, the unique element is in the right half\n            if arr[mid] == arr[mid + 1]:\n                low = mid + 2\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, the unique element is in the left half\n                high = mid\n        else:\n            # If mid is odd, check if the element at mid is equal to the previous element\n            if arr[mid] == arr[mid - 1]:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, the unique element is in the left half\n                high = mid\n    \n    # The low pointer will point to the unique element\n    return arr[low]\n```"
