    "raw_msg": "Let's fix the solution based on the insights from the previous analysis. The main issue was with the logic used to determine which element to return after the loop. We need to ensure that the `last` variable correctly holds the k-th element after the loop completes. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef find_kth(arr1, arr2, k):\n    # Initialize pointers for both arrays\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    # Initialize a counter to track the number of elements processed\n    counter = 0\n\n    # Loop until we reach the k-th element\n    while counter < k:\n        # If arr1 is not exhausted and either arr2 is exhausted or arr1[i] is less than or equal to arr2[j]\n        if i < len(arr1) and (j >= len(arr2) or arr1[i] <= arr2[j]):\n            # Move the pointer in arr1\n            last = arr1[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            # Move the pointer in arr2\n            last = arr2[j]\n            j += 1\n        # Increment the counter\n        counter += 1\n\n    # Return the last element processed, which is the k-th element\n    return last\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- We maintain a variable `last` to store the last element processed in each iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop completes, `last` will hold the k-th element, which we return. This ensures that we correctly identify the k-th element based on the order of elements processed.",
