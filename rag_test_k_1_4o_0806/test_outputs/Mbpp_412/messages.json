Odd numbers should be removed.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Iterate through each number in the input list.\n2. Check if the number is even. A number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.\n3. If the number is even, add it to a new list.\n4. Return the new list containing only even numbers.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction remove_odd(numbers):\n    create an empty list called even_numbers\n    for each number in numbers:\n        if number is even (number % 2 == 0):\n            append number to even_numbers\n    return even_numbers\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef remove_odd(numbers):\n    # Create an empty list to store even numbers\n    even_numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If even, add it to the even_numbers list\n            even_numbers.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of even numbers\n    return even_numbers\n```"
