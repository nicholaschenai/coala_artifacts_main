INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/412 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. Odd numbers should be removed.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate through each number in the input list.
2. Check if the number is even. A number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.
3. If the number is even, add it to a new list.
4. Return the new list containing only even numbers.

### Pseudocode

```
function remove_odd(numbers):
    create an empty list called even_numbers
    for each number in numbers:
        if number is even (number % 2 == 0):
            append number to even_numbers
    return even_numbers
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def remove_odd(numbers):
    # Create an empty list to store even numbers
    even_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is even
        if number % 2 == 0:
            # If even, add it to the even_numbers list
            even_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the list of even numbers
    return even_numbers
```

   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains only the even numbers from the original list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the given list. For each number, we will check if it is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If a number is even (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`), we will include it in the new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing only the even numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function named remove_odd that takes a list of integers as input.

   For each number in the input list:
       If the number is even (number % 2 == 0):
           Add the number to the list of even numbers.
   Return the list of even numbers.
