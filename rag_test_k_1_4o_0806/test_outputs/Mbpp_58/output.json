    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if two given integers have opposite signs. This means one integer should be positive and the other should be negative.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if two integers have opposite signs, we can use the property of multiplication. If two numbers have opposite signs, their product will be negative. Therefore, we can multiply the two integers and check if the result is negative. If it is, then the integers have opposite signs.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function opposite_Signs(a, b):\n       If a * b < 0:\n           Return True\n       Else:\n           Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef opposite_Signs(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the product of a and b is negative\n    # If the product is negative, it means a and b have opposite signs\n    return a * b < 0\n```\n\nThis function takes two integers as input and returns `True` if they have opposite signs, otherwise it returns `False`. The solution uses the property that the product of two numbers with opposite signs is negative.",
