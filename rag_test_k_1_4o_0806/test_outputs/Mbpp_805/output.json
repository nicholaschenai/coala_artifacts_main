    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the sublist within a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The function should return this sublist.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the sublist with the maximum sum found so far.\n   - Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists.\n   - For each sublist, calculate the sum of its elements.\n   - If the sum of the current sublist is greater than the maximum sum found so far, update the maximum sum and store the current sublist as the one with the maximum sum.\n   - After checking all sublists, return the sublist with the maximum sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_sum_list(list_of_lists):\n       max_sum = -infinity\n       max_list = None\n       \n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           current_sum = sum of elements in sublist\n           if current_sum > max_sum:\n               max_sum = current_sum\n               max_list = sublist\n       \n       return max_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_sum_list(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize the maximum sum to a very small number\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    # Initialize the list with the maximum sum to None\n    max_list = None\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Calculate the sum of the current sublist\n        current_sum = sum(sublist)\n        # If the current sum is greater than the maximum sum found so far\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            # Update the maximum sum\n            max_sum = current_sum\n            # Update the list with the maximum sum\n            max_list = sublist\n    \n    # Return the list with the maximum sum\n    return max_list\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find and return the sublist with the highest sum from a list of lists.",
