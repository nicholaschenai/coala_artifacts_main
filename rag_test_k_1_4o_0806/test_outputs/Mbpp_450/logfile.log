INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/450 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of strings and an integer as inputs. The function should return a new list containing only the strings from the original list that have a length equal to the given integer.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over each string in the input list.
   - For each string, we will check if its length matches the specified integer.
   - If the length matches, we will add the string to a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list containing all the strings of the specified length.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function extract_string with parameters string_list and size
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each string in string_list
           If the length of the string is equal to size
               Append the string to result
       Return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def extract_string(string_list, size):
    # Initialize an empty list to store strings of the specified length
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each string in the input list
    for string in string_list:
        # Check if the length of the current string matches the specified size
        if len(string) == size:
            # If it matches, add the string to the result list
            result.append(string)
    
    # Return the list of strings that have the specified length
    return result
```

This function will correctly filter and return strings from the input list that have a length equal to the specified size.

    ### Comments on this implementation

    The whole solution is given as a function which returns an array of length $n$ -- the Z-function of $s$.

    Array $z$ is initially filled with zeros. The current rightmost match segment is assumed to be $[0; 0)$ (that is, a deliberately small segment which doesn't contain any $i$).

    Inside the loop for $i = 1 \dots n - 1$ we first determine the initial value $z[i]$ -- it will either remain zero or be computed using the above formula.

    Thereafter, the trivial algorithm attempts to increase the value of $z[i]$ as much as possible.

    In the end, if it's required (that is, if $i + z[i] > r$), we update the rightmost match segment $[l, r)$.

    ## Asymptotic behavior of the algorithm

    We will prove that the above algorithm has a running time that is linear in the length of the string -- thus, it's $O(n)$.

    The proof is very simple.

    We are interested in the nested `while` loop, since everything else is just a bunch of constant operations which sums up to $O(n)$.

    We will show that **each iteration** of the `while` loop will increase the right border $r$ of the match segment.

    To do that, we will consider both branches of the algorithm:

    *   $i \geq r$

        In this case, either the `while` loop won't make any iteration (if $s[0] \ne s[i]$), or it will take a few iterations, starting at position $i$, each time moving one character to the right. After that, the right border $r$ will necessarily be updated.

        So we have found that, when $i \geq r$, each iteration of the `while` loop increases the value of the new $r$ index.

    *   $i < r$

        In this case, we initialize $z[i]$ to a certain value $z_0$ given by the above formula. Let's compare this initial value $z_0$ to the value $r - i$. We will have three cases:

          *   $z_0 < r - i$

              We prove that in this case no iteration of the `while` loop will take place.

              It's easy to prove, for example, by contradiction: if the `while` loop made at least one iteration, it would mean that initial approximation $z[i] = z_0$ was inaccurate (less than the match's actual length). But since $s[l \dots r)$ and $s[0 \dots r-l)$ are the same, this would imply that $z[i-l]$ holds the wrong value (less than it should be).

              Thus, since $z[i-l]$ is correct and it is less than $r - i$, it follows that this value coincides with the required value $z[i]$.

          *   $z_0 = r - i$

              In this case, the `while` loop can make a few iterations, but each of them will lead to an increase in the value of the $r$ index because we will start comparing from $s[r]$, which will climb beyond the $[l, r)$ interval.

          *   $z_0 > r - i$

              This option is impossible, by definition of $z_0$.

    So, we have proved that each iteration of the inner loop make the $r$ pointer advance to the right. Since $r$ can't be more than $n-1$, this means that the inner loop won't make more than $n-1$ iterations.

    As the rest of the algorithm obviously works in $O(n)$, we have proved that the whole algorithm for computing Z-functions runs in linear time.

    ## Applications

    We will now consider some uses of Z-functions for specific tasks.

    These applications will be largely similar to applications of [prefix function](prefix-function.md).

    ### Search the substring

    To avoid confusion, we call $t$ the **string of text**, and $p$ the **pattern**. The problem is: find all occurrences of the pattern $p$ inside the text $t$.

    To solve this problem, we create a new string $s = p + \diamond + t$, that is, we apply string concatenation to $p$ and $t$ but we also put a separator character $\diamond$ in the middle (we'll choose $\diamond$ so that it will certainly not be present anywhere in the strings $p$ or $t$).

    Compute the Z-function for $s$. Then, for any $i$ in the interval $[0; \; \operatorname{length}(t) - 1]$, we will consider the corresponding value $k = z[i + \operatorname{length}(p) + 1]$. If $k$ is equal to $\operatorname{length}(p)$ then we know there is one occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$, otherwise there is no occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$.

    The running time (and memory consumption) is $O(\operatorname{length}(t) + \operatorname{length}(p))$.

    ### Number of distinct substrings in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$, count the number of distinct substrings of $s$.

    We'll solve this problem iteratively. That is: knowing the current number of different substrings, recalculate this amount after adding to the end of $s$ one character.

    So, let $k$ be the current number of distinct substrings of $s$. We append a new character $c$ to $s$. Obviously, there can be some new substrings ending in this new character $c$ (namely, all those strings that end with this symbol and that we haven't encountered yet).

    Take a string $t = s + c$ and invert it (write its characters in reverse order). Our task is now to count how many prefixes of $t$ are not found anywhere else in $t$. Let's compute the Z-function of $t$ and find its maximum value $z_{max}$. Obviously, $t$'s prefix of length $z_{max}$ occurs also somewhere in the middle of $t$. Clearly, shorter prefixes also occur.

    So, we have found that the number of new substrings that appear when symbol $c$ is appended to $s$ is equal to $\operatorname{length}(t) - z_{max}$.

    Consequently, the running time of this solution is $O(n^2)$ for a string of length $n$.

    It's worth noting that in exactly the same way we can recalculate, still in $O(n)$ time, the number of distinct substrings when appending a character in the beginning of the string, as well as when removing it (from the end or the beginning).

    ### String compression

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$. Find its shortest "compressed" representation, that is: find a string $t$ of shortest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    A solution is: compute the Z-function of $s$, loop through all $i$ such that $i$ divides $n$. Stop at the first $i$ such that $i + z[i] = n$. Then, the string $s$ can be compressed to the length $i$.

    The proof for this fact is the same as the solution which uses the [prefix function](prefix-function.md).
