    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the input list. For each number, we will check if it is odd. A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero). If a number is odd, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list of odd numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function filter_oddnumbers that takes a list of numbers as input.\n   Initialize an empty list to store odd numbers.\n   For each number in the input list:\n       If the number is odd (number % 2 is not equal to 0):\n           Add the number to the list of odd numbers.\n   Return the list of odd numbers.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef filter_oddnumbers(numbers):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store odd numbers\n    odd_numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            # If the number is odd, add it to the list of odd numbers\n            odd_numbers.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of odd numbers\n    return odd_numbers\n```",
