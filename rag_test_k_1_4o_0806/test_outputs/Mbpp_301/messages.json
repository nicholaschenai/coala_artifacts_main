The depth is defined as the number of levels of nested dictionaries. For example, a dictionary with no nested dictionaries has a depth of 1, and a dictionary with one level of nested dictionaries has a depth of 2, and so on.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will create a recursive function to determine the depth of the dictionary.\n   - The base case will be when the dictionary is empty or has no nested dictionaries, in which case the depth is 1.\n   - For each key in the dictionary, if the value is another dictionary, we will recursively calculate the depth of that dictionary.\n   - We will keep track of the maximum depth encountered among all the nested dictionaries.\n   - The depth of the current dictionary will be 1 plus the maximum depth of its nested dictionaries.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function dict_depth(d):\n       if d is not a dictionary or is empty:\n           return 1\n       max_depth = 1\n       for each key, value in d:\n           if value is a dictionary:\n               depth = dict_depth(value)\n               max_depth = max(max_depth, depth + 1)\n       return max_depth\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef dict_depth(d):\n    # Base case: if the input is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary\n    if not isinstance(d, dict) or not d:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the maximum depth to 1 (the current level)\n    max_depth = 1\n    \n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary\n    for key, value in d.items():\n        # If the value is a dictionary, calculate its depth recursively\n        if isinstance(value, dict):\n            # Calculate the depth of the nested dictionary\n            depth = dict_depth(value)\n            # Update the maximum depth encountered\n            max_depth = max(max_depth, depth + 1)\n    \n    # Return the maximum depth found\n    return max_depth\n```\n\nThis solution uses recursion to explore each level of nested dictionaries and keeps track of the maximum depth encountered. The base case ensures that even an empty dictionary or a non-dictionary input returns a depth of 1."

(2) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);\n\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    Note that there may be several maximum-length paths.\n    In the above path, we could replace node 6 with node 5\n    to obtain another path with length 4.\n\n    Next we will discuss two $O(n)$ time algorithms\n    for calculating the diameter of a tree.\n    The first algorithm is based on dynamic programming,\n    and the second algorithm uses two depth-first searches.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    A general way to approach many tree problems\n    is to first root the tree arbitrarily.\n    After this, we can try to solve the problem\n    separately for each subtree.\n    Our first algorithm for calculating the diameter\n    is based on this idea.\n\n    An important observation is that every path\n    in a rooted tree has a \\emph{highest point}:\n    the highest node that belongs to the path.\n    Thus, we can calculate for each node the length\n    of the longest path whose highest point is the node.\n    One of those paths corresponds to the diameter of the tree.\n\n    For example, in the following tree,\n    node 1 is the highest point on the path\n    that corresponds to the diameter:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]\n    \\node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,1) {$4$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (3) at (-2,1) {$2$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (4) at (0,1) {$3$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (5) at (2,-1) {$7$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (6) at (-3,-1) {$5$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (7) at (-1,-1) {$6$};\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);\n\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    We calculate for each node $x$ two values:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\texttt{toLeaf}(x)$: the maximum length of a path from $x$ to any leaf\n    \\item $\\texttt{maxLength}(x)$: the maximum length of a path\n    whose highest point is $x$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    For example, in the above tree,\n    $\\texttt{toLeaf}(1)=2$, because there is a path\n    $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 6$,\n    and $\\texttt{maxLength}(1)=4$,\n    because there is a path\n    $6 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 7$.\n    In this case, $\\texttt{maxLength}(1)$ equals the diameter.\n\n    Dynamic programming can be used to calculate the above\n    values for all nodes in $O(n)$ time.\n    First, to calculate $\\texttt{toLeaf}(x)$,\n    we go through the children of $x$,\n    choose a child $c$ with maximum $\\texttt{toLeaf}(c)$\n    and add one to this value.\n    Then, to calculate $\\texttt{maxLength}(x)$,\n    we choose two distinct children $a$ and $b$\n    such that the sum $\\texttt{toLeaf}(a)+\\texttt{toLeaf}(b)$\n    is maximum and add two to this sum.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    Another efficient way to calculate the diameter\n    of a tree is based on two depth-first searches.\n    First, we choose an arbitrary node $a$ in the tree\n    and find the farthest node $b$ from $a$.\n    Then, we find the farthest node $c$ from $b$.\n    The diameter of the tree is the distance between $b$ and $c$.\n\n    In the following graph, $a$, $b$ and $c$ could be:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]\n    \\node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,3) {$4$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (3) at (0,1) {$2$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (4) at (2,1) {$3$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (5) at (4,1) {$7$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (6) at (-2,3) {$5$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (7) at (-2,1) {$6$};\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);\n    \\node[color=red] at (2,1.6) {$a$};\n    \\node[color=red] at (-2,1.6) {$b$};\n    \\node[color=red] at (4,1.6) {$c$};\n\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    This is an elegant method, but why does it work?\n\n    It helps to draw the tree differently so that\n    the path that corresponds to the diameter\n    is horizontal, and all other\n    nodes hang from it:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]\n    \\node[draw, circle] (1) at (2,1) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (2) at (4,1) {$4$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (3) at (0,1) {$2$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (4) at (2,-1) {$3$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (5) at (6,1) {$7$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (6) at (0,-1) {$5$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (7) at (-2,1) {$6$};\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);\n    \\node[color=red] at (2,-1.6) {$a$};\n    \\node[color=red] at (-2,1.6) {$b$};\n    \\node[color=red] at (6,1.6) {$c$};\n    \\node[color=red] at (2,1.6) {$x$};\n\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Node $x$ indicates the place where the path\n    from node $a$ joins the path that corresponds\n    to the diameter.\n    The farthest node from $a$\n    is node $b$, node $c$ or some other node\n    that is at least as far from node $x$.\n    Thus, this node is always a valid choice for\n    an endpoint of a path that corresponds to the diameter.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
