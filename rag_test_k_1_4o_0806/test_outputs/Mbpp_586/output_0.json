    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list and an integer `n`, splits the list at the `n`-th index, and then appends the first part of the list to the end of the second part. The function should return the modified list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, identify the position in the list where the split should occur, which is given by the integer `n`.\n   - Split the list into two parts: the first part contains elements from the start of the list up to (but not including) the `n`-th element, and the second part contains the rest of the elements.\n   - Concatenate the second part of the list with the first part.\n   - Return the concatenated list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function split_Arr(arr, n):\n       first_part = arr[0:n]  # Elements from start to n (exclusive)\n       second_part = arr[n:]  # Elements from n to end\n       result = second_part + first_part  # Concatenate second part with first part\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef split_Arr(arr, n):\n    # Split the list into two parts\n    first_part = arr[0:n]  # Elements from the start to the n-th element (exclusive)\n    second_part = arr[n:]  # Elements from the n-th element to the end\n    \n    # Concatenate the second part with the first part\n    result = second_part + first_part\n    \n    # Return the modified list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take a list and an integer `n`, split the list at the `n`-th index, and return a new list with the first part moved to the end.",
