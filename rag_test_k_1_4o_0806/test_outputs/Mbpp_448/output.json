    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the first `n` Perrin numbers. The Perrin sequence is defined as follows:\n   - P(0) = 3\n   - P(1) = 0\n   - P(2) = 2\n   - For n >= 3, P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Initialize the first three Perrin numbers.\n   - Use a loop to calculate subsequent Perrin numbers up to the nth number using the recurrence relation.\n   - Accumulate the sum of these numbers as we calculate them.\n   - Return the accumulated sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function cal_sum(n):\n       Initialize perrin_numbers as [3, 0, 2]\n       Initialize sum as 3 + 0 + 2\n       \n       If n <= 2:\n           Return sum of first n+1 elements of perrin_numbers\n       \n       For i from 3 to n:\n           Calculate next_perrin as perrin_numbers[i-2] + perrin_numbers[i-3]\n           Append next_perrin to perrin_numbers\n           Add next_perrin to sum\n       \n       Return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef cal_sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the first three Perrin numbers\n    perrin_numbers = [3, 0, 2]\n    # Calculate the initial sum of the first three numbers\n    sum_perrin = sum(perrin_numbers)\n    \n    # If n is less than or equal to 2, return the sum of the first n+1 numbers\n    if n <= 2:\n        return sum(perrin_numbers[:n+1])\n    \n    # Calculate the Perrin numbers from 3 to n\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the next Perrin number using the recurrence relation\n        next_perrin = perrin_numbers[i - 2] + perrin_numbers[i - 3]\n        # Append the new number to the list\n        perrin_numbers.append(next_perrin)\n        # Add the new number to the sum\n        sum_perrin += next_perrin\n    \n    # Return the total sum of the first n Perrin numbers\n    return sum_perrin\n```",
