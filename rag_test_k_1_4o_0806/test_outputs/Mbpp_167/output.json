    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that finds the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to a given integer `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - If `n` is 0, the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n` is 1.\n   - If `n` is already a power of 2, then `n` itself is the answer.\n   - If `n` is not a power of 2, we need to find the next power of 2 that is greater than `n`.\n   - We can do this by starting from 1 and continuously doubling it (i.e., multiplying by 2) until it becomes greater than or equal to `n`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function next_power_of_2(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 1\n       power = 1\n       while power < n:\n           power = power * 2\n       return power\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef next_power_of_2(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is 0, the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n is 1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1\n    power = 1\n    \n    # Double the power until it is greater than or equal to n\n    while power < n:\n        power *= 2\n    \n    # Return the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n\n    return power\n```",
