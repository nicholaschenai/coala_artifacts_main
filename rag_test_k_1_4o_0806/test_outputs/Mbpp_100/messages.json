A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the next smallest palindrome:\n   - Start with the number immediately greater than the given integer.\n   - Check if this number is a palindrome.\n   - If it is, return it.\n   - If not, increment the number and check again.\n   - Repeat this process until a palindrome is found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function is_palindrome that checks if a number is a palindrome:\n       Convert the number to a string\n       Check if the string is equal to its reverse\n       Return True if they are equal, otherwise False\n\n   Define the main function next_smallest_palindrome:\n       Start with the number one greater than the input number\n       While True:\n           Check if the current number is a palindrome using is_palindrome\n           If it is, return the current number\n           Otherwise, increment the current number by 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    s = str(n)\n    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(n: int) -> int:\n    # Start with the number immediately greater than n\n    n += 1\n    # Continuously check for the next palindrome\n    while True:\n        # Check if the current number is a palindrome\n        if is_palindrome(n):\n            # If it is, return the number\n            return n\n        # Otherwise, increment the number and check again\n        n += 1\n```\n\nThis solution defines a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a number is a palindrome and uses it in the main function `next_smallest_palindrome` to find the next smallest palindrome greater than the given integer."

Find all the pairs $(i, j)$ such that substring $s[i\\dots j]$ is a palindrome. String $t$ is a palindrome when $t = t_{rev}$ ($t_{rev}$ is a reversed string for $t$).\n\n    ## More precise statement\n\n    In the worst case string might have up to $O(n^2)$ palindromic substrings, and at the first glance it seems that there is no linear algorithm for this problem.\n\n    But the information about the palindromes can be kept **in a compact way**: for each position $i$ we will find the number of non-empty palindromes centered at this position.\n\n    Palindromes with a common center form a contiguous chain, that is if we have a palindrome of length $l$ centered in $i$, we also have palindromes of lengths $l-2$, $l-4$ and so on also centered in $i$. Therefore, we will collect the information about all palindromic substrings in this way.\n\n    Palindromes of odd and even lengths are accounted for separately as $d_{odd}[i]$ and $d_{even}[i]$. For the palindromes of even length we assume that they're centered in the position $i$ if their two central characters are $s[i]$ and $s[i-1]$.\n\n    For instance, string $s = abababc$ has three palindromes with odd length with centers in the position $s[3] = b$, i. e. $d_{odd}[3] = 3$:\n\n    $$a\\ \\overbrace{b\\ a\\ \\underbrace{b}_{s_3}\\ a\\ b}^{d_{odd}[3]=3} c$$\n\n    And string $s = cbaabd$ has two palindromes with even length with centers in the position $s[3] = a$, i. e. $d_{even}[3] = 2$:\n\n    $$c\\ \\overbrace{b\\ a\\ \\underbrace{a}_{s_3}\\ b}^{d_{even}[3]=2} d$$\n\n    It's a surprising fact that there is an algorithm, which is simple enough, that calculates these \"palindromity arrays\" $d_{odd}[]$ and $d_{even}[]$ in linear time. The algorithm is described in this article.\n\n    ## Solution\n\n    In general, this problem has many solutions: with [String Hashing](/string/string-hashing.html) it can be solved in $O(n\\cdot \\log n)$, and with [Suffix Trees](/string/suffix-tree-ukkonen.html) and fast LCA this problem can be solved in $O(n)$.\n\n    But the method described here is **sufficiently** simpler and has less hidden constant in time and memory complexity. This algorithm was discovered by **Glenn K. Manacher** in 1975.\n\n    Another modern way to solve this problem and to deal with palindromes in general is through the so-called palindromic tree, or eertree.\n\n    ## Trivial algorithm\n\n    To avoid ambiguities in the further description we denote what \"trivial algorithm\" is.\n\n    It's the algorithm that does the following. For each center position $i$ it tries to increase the answer by one as long as it's possible, comparing a pair of corresponding characters each time.\n\n    Such an algorithm is slow, it can calculate the answer only in $O(n^2)$.\n\n    The implementation of the trivial algorithm is:\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        s = \"$\" + s + \"^\";\n        vector<int> p(n + 2);\n        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {\n                p[i]++;\n            }\n        }\n        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
