## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the next smallest integer that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the next smallest palindrome:
   - Start with the number immediately greater than the given integer.
   - Check if this number is a palindrome.
   - If it is, return it.
   - If not, increment the number and check again.
   - Repeat this process until a palindrome is found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function is_palindrome that checks if a number is a palindrome:
       Convert the number to a string
       Check if the string is equal to its reverse
       Return True if they are equal, otherwise False

   Define the main function next_smallest_palindrome:
       Start with the number one greater than the input number
       While True:
           Check if the current number is a palindrome using is_palindrome
           If it is, return the current number
           Otherwise, increment the current number by 1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_palindrome(n: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the number to a string
    s = str(n)
    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse
    return s == s[::-1]

def next_smallest_palindrome(n: int) -> int:
    # Start with the number immediately greater than n
    n += 1
    # Continuously check for the next palindrome
    while True:
        # Check if the current number is a palindrome
        if is_palindrome(n):
            # If it is, return the number
            return n
        # Otherwise, increment the number and check again
        n += 1
```

This solution defines a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a number is a palindrome and uses it in the main function `next_smallest_palindrome` to find the next smallest palindrome greater than the given integer.

    Part: 1/2
    # Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$

    ## Statement

    Given string $s$ with length $n$. Find all the pairs $(i, j)$ such that substring $s[i\dots j]$ is a palindrome. String $t$ is a palindrome when $t = t_{rev}$ ($t_{rev}$ is a reversed string for $t$).

    ## More precise statement

    In the worst case string might have up to $O(n^2)$ palindromic substrings, and at the first glance it seems that there is no linear algorithm for this problem.

    But the information about the palindromes can be kept **in a compact way**: for each position $i$ we will find the number of non-empty palindromes centered at this position.

    Palindromes with a common center form a contiguous chain, that is if we have a palindrome of length $l$ centered in $i$, we also have palindromes of lengths $l-2$, $l-4$ and so on also centered in $i$. Therefore, we will collect the information about all palindromic substrings in this way.

    Palindromes of odd and even lengths are accounted for separately as $d_{odd}[i]$ and $d_{even}[i]$. For the palindromes of even length we assume that they're centered in the position $i$ if their two central characters are $s[i]$ and $s[i-1]$.

    For instance, string $s = abababc$ has three palindromes with odd length with centers in the position $s[3] = b$, i. e. $d_{odd}[3] = 3$:

    $$a\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{b}_{s_3}\ a\ b}^{d_{odd}[3]=3} c$$

    And string $s = cbaabd$ has two palindromes with even length with centers in the position $s[3] = a$, i. e. $d_{even}[3] = 2$:

    $$c\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{a}_{s_3}\ b}^{d_{even}[3]=2} d$$

    It's a surprising fact that there is an algorithm, which is simple enough, that calculates these "palindromity arrays" $d_{odd}[]$ and $d_{even}[]$ in linear time. The algorithm is described in this article.

    ## Solution

    In general, this problem has many solutions: with [String Hashing](/string/string-hashing.html) it can be solved in $O(n\cdot \log n)$, and with [Suffix Trees](/string/suffix-tree-ukkonen.html) and fast LCA this problem can be solved in $O(n)$.

    But the method described here is **sufficiently** simpler and has less hidden constant in time and memory complexity. This algorithm was discovered by **Glenn K. Manacher** in 1975.

    Another modern way to solve this problem and to deal with palindromes in general is through the so-called palindromic tree, or eertree.

    ## Trivial algorithm

    To avoid ambiguities in the further description we denote what "trivial algorithm" is.

    It's the algorithm that does the following. For each center position $i$ it tries to increase the answer by one as long as it's possible, comparing a pair of corresponding characters each time.

    Such an algorithm is slow, it can calculate the answer only in $O(n^2)$.

    The implementation of the trivial algorithm is:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        s = "$" + s + "^";
        vector<int> p(n + 2);
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {
                p[i]++;
            }
        }
        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);
    }
