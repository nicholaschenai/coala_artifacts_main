    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts the number of pairs in a list of integers such that the XOR of the two numbers in each pair is odd.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - XOR of two numbers is odd if one of the numbers is odd and the other is even.\n   - Therefore, to find the number of pairs with an odd XOR, we need to count how many numbers in the list are odd and how many are even.\n   - The number of such pairs is the product of the count of odd numbers and the count of even numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):\n       initialize odd_count to 0\n       initialize even_count to 0\n       \n       for each number in arr:\n           if number is odd:\n               increment odd_count\n           else:\n               increment even_count\n       \n       return odd_count * even_count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):\n    # Initialize counters for odd and even numbers\n    odd_count = 0\n    even_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 == 1:\n            odd_count += 1\n        else:\n            even_count += 1\n    \n    # The number of pairs with an odd XOR is the product of odd and even counts\n    return odd_count * even_count\n```",
