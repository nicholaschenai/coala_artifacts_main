    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list and an integer L as inputs. The function should split the list into two parts: the first part should have a length of L, and the second part should contain the remaining elements. The function should return these two parts as a tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use list slicing. We will slice the list into two parts: the first part will contain the first L elements, and the second part will contain the rest of the elements. We will then return these two parts as a tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function split_two_parts with parameters lst (list) and L (integer)\n       Slice the list lst from the start to L to get the first part\n       Slice the list lst from L to the end to get the second part\n       Return a tuple containing the first part and the second part\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef split_two_parts(lst: list, L: int) -> tuple:\n    # Slice the list from the start to L to get the first part\n    first_part = lst[:L]\n    # Slice the list from L to the end to get the second part\n    second_part = lst[L:]\n    # Return a tuple containing the first part and the second part\n    return (first_part, second_part)\n```",
