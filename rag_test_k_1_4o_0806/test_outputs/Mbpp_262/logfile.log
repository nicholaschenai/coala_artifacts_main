INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/262 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer `L`. The function should split the list into two parts: the first part should have a length of `L`, and the second part should contain the remaining elements. The function should return these two parts as a tuple.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We can use list slicing to achieve this. The first part of the list can be obtained by slicing from the start of the list to the `L`-th index. The second part can be obtained by slicing from the `L`-th index to the end of the list. We then return these two slices as a tuple.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `split_two_parts` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`.
   - Slice the list from the start to `L` to get the first part.
   - Slice the list from `L` to the end to get the second part.
   - Return a tuple containing the first and second parts.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def split_two_parts(lst, L):
    # Slice the list from the start to L to get the first part
    first_part = lst[:L]
    # Slice the list from L to the end to get the second part
    second_part = lst[L:]
    # Return a tuple containing the first and second parts
    return (first_part, second_part)
```

This solution uses list slicing to efficiently split the list into two parts and returns them as a tuple. The slicing operation is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in capabilities to handle list operations.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
