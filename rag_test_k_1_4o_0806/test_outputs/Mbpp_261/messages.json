This new tuple should contain the result of dividing each element of the first tuple by the corresponding element in the second tuple.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will perform division.\n   - We will store the result of each division in a new tuple.\n   - Finally, we will return this new tuple containing all the division results.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `division_elements` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.\n   - Initialize an empty list `result`.\n   - Loop over the indices of the tuples (assuming both tuples are of the same length):\n     - Divide the element at the current index of `tuple1` by the element at the same index of `tuple2`.\n     - Append the result of the division to the `result` list.\n   - Convert the `result` list to a tuple.\n   - Return the resulting tuple.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef division_elements(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of division\n    result = []\n    \n    # Loop over the indices of the tuples\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Perform division of the elements at the current index\n        division_result = tuple1[i] // tuple2[i]\n        # Append the result to the result list\n        result.append(division_result)\n    \n    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly perform element-wise division of the two input tuples and return the results as a new tuple."
