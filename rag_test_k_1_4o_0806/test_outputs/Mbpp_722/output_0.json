    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary of students, where each key is a student's name and the value is a tuple containing the student's height and weight. Additionally, the function takes two float values representing the minimum height and weight. The function should return a new dictionary containing only those students whose height and weight are both greater than the specified minimum values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the filtered students.\n   - Iterate over each student in the input dictionary.\n   - For each student, check if both their height and weight are greater than the specified minimum values.\n   - If both conditions are met, add the student to the new dictionary.\n   - Return the new dictionary containing only the students who meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function filter_data(students, min_height, min_weight):\n       create an empty dictionary called filtered_students\n       for each student_name, (height, weight) in students:\n           if height > min_height and weight > min_weight:\n               add student_name and (height, weight) to filtered_students\n       return filtered_students\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef filter_data(students: dict, min_height: float, min_weight: float) -> dict:\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the filtered students\n    filtered_students = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each student in the input dictionary\n    for student_name, (height, weight) in students.items():\n        # Check if both height and weight are greater than the specified minimum values\n        if height > min_height and weight > min_weight:\n            # Add the student to the filtered dictionary\n            filtered_students[student_name] = (height, weight)\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing only the students who meet the criteria\n    return filtered_students\n```",
