INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/555 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the difference between two sums for the first `n` natural numbers:
1. The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.
2. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Sum of Cubes**: For the first `n` natural numbers, calculate the sum of their cubes. This means for numbers 1 through `n`, compute \(1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + n^3\).

2. **Sum of Natural Numbers**: Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is \(1 + 2 + \ldots + n\).

3. **Difference**: Subtract the sum of the natural numbers from the sum of their cubes.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize `sum_of_cubes` to 0.
2. Initialize `sum_of_numbers` to 0.
3. Loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive):
   - Add `i^3` to `sum_of_cubes`.
   - Add `i` to `sum_of_numbers`.
4. Calculate the difference as `sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers`.
5. Return the difference.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def difference(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize sums
    sum_of_cubes = 0
    sum_of_numbers = 0
    
    # Calculate the sums
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3
        sum_of_numbers += i
    
    # Calculate the difference
    diff = sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers
    
    # Return the result
    return diff
```

This function will correctly compute the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }
