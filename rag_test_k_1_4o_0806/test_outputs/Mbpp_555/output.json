    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that calculates the difference between two sums for the first `n` natural numbers. The first sum is the sum of the cubes of these numbers, and the second sum is the sum of the numbers themselves. The function should return this difference.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.\n   - Then, calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.\n   - Subtract the sum of the natural numbers from the sum of their cubes.\n   - Return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function difference(n):\n       sum_natural = 0\n       sum_cubes = 0\n       \n       for i from 1 to n:\n           sum_natural += i\n           sum_cubes += i^3\n       \n       result = sum_cubes - sum_natural\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef difference(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of natural numbers and the sum of cubes\n    sum_natural = 0\n    sum_cubes = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the first n natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Add the current number to the sum of natural numbers\n        sum_natural += i\n        # Add the cube of the current number to the sum of cubes\n        sum_cubes += i ** 3\n    \n    # Calculate the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of natural numbers\n    result = sum_cubes - sum_natural\n    \n    # Return the result\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code calculates the required difference by iterating through the first `n` natural numbers, computing both the sum of the numbers and the sum of their cubes, and then returning the difference between these two sums.",
