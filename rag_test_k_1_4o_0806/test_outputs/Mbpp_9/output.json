    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the minimum number of rotations required to transform a given string into itself. A rotation involves moving the first character of the string to the end. We need to find the smallest number of such rotations greater than zero that results in the original string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can repeatedly rotate the string by moving the first character to the end and check if the resulting string matches the original string. We start with one rotation and continue until we find a match. The number of rotations needed to match the original string is our answer.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_Rotations(s):\n       original = s\n       for i from 1 to length of s:\n           rotate s by moving the first character to the end\n           if s equals original:\n               return i\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_Rotations(s: str) -> int:\n    # Store the original string for comparison\n    original = s\n    \n    # Iterate over the possible number of rotations\n    for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):\n        # Rotate the string by moving the first character to the end\n        s = s[1:] + s[0]\n        \n        # Check if the rotated string matches the original string\n        if s == original:\n            # Return the number of rotations needed\n            return i\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine the minimum number of rotations required to return the string to its original form.",
