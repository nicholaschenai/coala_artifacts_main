INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/274 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices in the expansion of `(x + y)^n`. The binomial coefficient at index `k` in this expansion is given by `C(n, k)`, which is the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Calculate the binomial coefficients for even indices from 0 to `n`.
   - Sum these coefficients.
   - Return the sum.

   The binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n-k)!}
   \]
   where `!` denotes factorial.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function factorial that calculates the factorial of a number.
   
   Define the main function even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):
       Initialize sum_even_coeff to 0
       For each even index k from 0 to n (inclusive):
           Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k) using the factorial function
           Add the binomial coefficient to sum_even_coeff
       Return sum_even_coeff
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
# Helper function to calculate factorial of a number
def factorial(num: int) -> int:
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, num + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Main function to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients
def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    sum_even_coeff = 0
    # Iterate over even indices from 0 to n
    for k in range(0, n + 1, 2):
        # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)
        binomial_coeff = factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))
        # Add the binomial coefficient to the sum
        sum_even_coeff += binomial_coeff
    return sum_even_coeff
```

This code defines a helper function `factorial` to compute the factorial of a number, and the main function `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum` to compute the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given `n`.

    Chapter: Combinatorics
    Section: Binomial coefficients
    Part: 1/2
    \chapter{Combinatorics}

    \index{combinatorics}

    \key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting
    combinations of objects.
    Usually, the goal is to find a way to
    count the combinations efficiently
    without generating each combination separately.

    As an example, consider the problem
    of counting the number of ways to
    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.
    For example, there are 8 representations
    for $4$:
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1+1+1+1$
    \item $1+1+2$
    \item $1+2+1$
    \item $2+1+1$
    \item $2+2$
    \item $3+1$
    \item $1+3$
    \item $4$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}

    A combinatorial problem can often be solved
    using a recursive function.
    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$
    that gives the number of representations for $n$.
    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.
    The values of the function
    can be recursively calculated as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        f(n) = \begin{cases}
                   1               & n = 0\\
                   f(0)+f(1)+\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case is $f(0)=1$,
    because the empty sum represents the number 0.
    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to
    choose the first number of the sum.
    If the first number is $k$,
    there are $f(n-k)$ representations
    for the remaining part of the sum.
    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values
    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.

    The first values for the function are:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    f(0) & = & 1 \\
    f(1) & = & 1 \\
    f(2) & = & 2 \\
    f(3) & = & 4 \\
    f(4) & = & 8 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced
    with a closed-form formula.
    In this problem,
    \[
    f(n)=2^{n-1},
    \]
    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$
    possible positions for +-signs in the sum
    and we can choose any subset of them.

    \section{Binomial coefficients}

    \index{binomial coefficient}

    The \key{binomial coefficient} ${n \choose k}$
    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset
    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.
    For example, ${5 \choose 3}=10$,
    because the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:
    \[ \{1,2,3\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,2,5\}, \{1,3,4\}, \{1,3,5\}, 
    \{1,4,5\}, \{2,3,4\}, \{2,3,5\}, \{2,4,5\}, \{3,4,5\} \]

    \subsubsection{Formula 1}

    Binomial coefficients can be
    recursively calculated as follows:

    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}
    \]

    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.
    If $x$ is included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k-1$
    elements from $n-1$ elements,
    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.

    The base cases for the recursion are
    \[
    {n \choose 0}  =  {n \choose n} = 1,
    \]
    because there is always exactly
    one way to construct an empty subset
    and a subset that contains all the elements.

    \subsubsection{Formula 2}

    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.
    \]

    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.
    We go through all permutations and always
    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation
    in the subset.
    Since the order of the elements in the subset
    and outside the subset does not matter,
    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$

    \subsubsection{Properties}

    For binomial coefficients,
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n \choose n-k},
    \]
    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into
    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements
    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.

    The sum of binomial coefficients is
    \[
    {n \choose 0}+{n \choose 1}+{n \choose 2}+\ldots+{n \choose n}=2^n.
    \]

    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''
    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to
    the $n$th power:

    \[ (a+b)^n =
    {n \choose 0} a^n b^0 + 
    {n \choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +
    \ldots + 
    {n \choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +
    {n \choose n} a^0 b^n. \]

    \index{Pascal's triangle}

    Binomial coefficients also appear in
    \key{Pascal's triangle}
    where each value equals the sum of two
    above values:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}{0.9}
    \node at (0,0) {1};
    \node at (-0.5,-0.5) {1};
    \node at (0.5,-0.5) {1};
    \node at (-1,-1) {1};
    \node at (0,-1) {2};
    \node at (1,-1) {1};
    \node at (-1.5,-1.5) {1};
    \node at (-0.5,-1.5) {3};
    \node at (0.5,-1.5) {3};
    \node at (1.5,-1.5) {1};
    \node at (-2,-2) {1};
    \node at (-1,-2) {4};
    \node at (0,-2) {6};
    \node at (1,-2) {4};
    \node at (2,-2) {1};
    \node at (-2,-2.5) {$\ldots$};
    \node at (-1,-2.5) {$\ldots$};

    \node at (1,-2.5) {$\ldots$};
    \node at (2,-2.5) {$\ldots$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Boxes and balls}

    ''Boxes and balls'' is a useful model,
    where we count the ways to
    place $k$ balls in $n$ boxes.
    Let us consider three scenarios:

    \textit{Scenario 1}: Each box can contain
    at most one ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 10 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --
                        (#1+0.5,#2-0.5) -- (#1+0.5,#2+0.5);
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{
        \lax{#1}{#2}{#3}
        \lax{#1+1.2}{#2}{#4}
        \lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}
        \lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}
        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{-4}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    In this scenario, the answer is directly the
    binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 2}: A box can contain multiple balls.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 15 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --

    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{

        \lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}
        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-8}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-6}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{-8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}

    \laa{16}{-8}{0}{0}{0}{0}{2}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The process of placing the balls in the boxes
    can be represented as a string
    that consists of symbols
    ''o'' and ''$\rightarrow$''.
    Initially, assume that we are standing at the leftmost box.
    The symbol ''o'' means that we place a ball
    in the current box, and the symbol
    ''$\rightarrow$'' means that we move to
    the next box to the right.

    Using this notation, each solution is a string
    that contains $k$ times the symbol ''o'' and
    $n-1$ times the symbol ''$\rightarrow$''.
    For example, the upper-right solution
    in the above picture corresponds to the string
    ''$\rightarrow$ $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$''.
    Thus, the number of solutions is
    ${k+n-1 \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 3}: Each box may contain at most one ball,
    and in addition, no two adjacent boxes may both contain a ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/274 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices for the binomial expansion of `(a + b)^n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The binomial coefficients for `(a + b)^n` are given by the formula `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`, where `k` ranges from `0` to `n`. We need to sum the coefficients where `k` is even. A property of binomial coefficients is that the sum of all coefficients is `2^n`. For even `n`, the sum of coefficients at even indices is equal to the sum of coefficients at odd indices, which is `2^(n-1)`. For odd `n`, the sum of coefficients at even indices is also `2^(n-1)`.
