    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices for the binomial expansion of `(a + b)^n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The binomial coefficients for `(a + b)^n` are given by the formula `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)`, where `k` ranges from `0` to `n`. We need to sum the coefficients where `k` is even. A property of binomial coefficients is that the sum of all coefficients is `2^n`. For even `n`, the sum of coefficients at even indices is equal to the sum of coefficients at odd indices, which is `2^(n-1)`. For odd `n`, the sum of coefficients at even indices is also `2^(n-1)`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):\n       return 2^(n-1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # The sum of even index binomial coefficients for (a + b)^n\n    # is 2^(n-1) due to the symmetry and properties of binomial coefficients.\n    return 2 ** (n - 1)\n```\n\nThis solution leverages the properties of binomial coefficients to efficiently compute the desired sum without explicitly calculating each coefficient.",
