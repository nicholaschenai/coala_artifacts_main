You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/623 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and an integer `n`. The function should return a new list where each number from the original list is raised to the power of `n`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each number in the input list.
   - For each number, we will compute its `n`-th power.
   - We will collect these computed values into a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `nth_nums` that takes a list `numbers` and an integer `n`.
   - Initialize an empty list `result`.
   - For each `number` in `numbers`:
     - Compute `number` raised to the power of `n`.
     - Append the result to the `result` list.
   - Return the `result` list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def nth_nums(numbers: list, n: int) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # Compute the n-th power of the current number
        powered_number = number ** n
        # Append the computed power to the result list
        result.append(powered_number)
    
    # Return the list containing all the n-th powers
    return result
```

This solution iterates over each element in the input list, computes its `n`-th power, and collects the results in a new list, which is then returned.
