    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that converts a string from snake_case to CamelCase. In snake_case, words are separated by underscores, and in CamelCase, each word starts with a capital letter and there are no underscores.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, split the input string by underscores to get a list of words.\n   - Capitalize the first letter of each word.\n   - Join all the capitalized words together to form a single string.\n   - Return the resulting CamelCase string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function snake_to_camel(snake_str):\n       split the snake_str by underscores to get a list of words\n       capitalize the first letter of each word in the list\n       join all the capitalized words into a single string\n       return the resulting string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef snake_to_camel(snake_str: str) -> str:\n    # Split the input string by underscores to get a list of words\n    words = snake_str.split('_')\n    \n    # Capitalize the first letter of each word\n    capitalized_words = [word.capitalize() for word in words]\n    \n    # Join all the capitalized words into a single string\n    camel_case_str = ''.join(capitalized_words)\n    \n    # Return the resulting CamelCase string\n    return camel_case_str\n```",
