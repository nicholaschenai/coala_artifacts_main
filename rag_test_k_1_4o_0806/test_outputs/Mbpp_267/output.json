    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, identify the first `n` odd natural numbers. Odd numbers start from 1 and increase by 2 each time (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...).\n   - For each of these odd numbers, calculate its square.\n   - Sum up all these squared values.\n   - Return the total sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function square_Sum(n):\n       Initialize sum_of_squares to 0\n       Initialize current_odd_number to 1\n       For i from 1 to n:\n           Add the square of current_odd_number to sum_of_squares\n           Increment current_odd_number by 2 (to get the next odd number)\n       Return sum_of_squares\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of squares to 0\n    sum_of_squares = 0\n    # Start with the first odd number\n    current_odd_number = 1\n    \n    # Loop to calculate the sum of squares of the first n odd numbers\n    for _ in range(n):\n        # Add the square of the current odd number to the sum\n        sum_of_squares += current_odd_number ** 2\n        # Move to the next odd number\n        current_odd_number += 2\n    \n    # Return the calculated sum of squares\n    return sum_of_squares\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers by iterating through the first `n` odd numbers, squaring each, and accumulating the result.",
