INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/56 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given integer is one less than twice the reverse of its digits. For example, if the number is 70, we reverse the digits to get 07 (or 7), then double it to get 14, and check if 70 is one less than 14. If it is, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Reverse the Digits**: Convert the number to a string, reverse the string, and convert it back to an integer.
2. **Double the Reversed Number**: Multiply the reversed number by 2.
3. **Check the Condition**: Verify if the original number is one less than the doubled reversed number.
4. **Return the Result**: Return `True` if the condition is met, otherwise return `False`.

### Pseudocode

```
function check(n):
    convert n to string and reverse it
    convert the reversed string back to an integer, call it reversed_number
    double the reversed_number
    if n is equal to (2 * reversed_number) - 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Python Code

```python
def check(n: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the number to a string and reverse it
    reversed_str = str(n)[::-1]
    # Convert the reversed string back to an integer
    reversed_number = int(reversed_str)
    # Double the reversed number
    doubled_reversed = 2 * reversed_number
    # Check if the original number is one less than the doubled reversed number
    return n == doubled_reversed - 1

   We need to write a function that checks if a given number is one less than twice the reverse of its digits. For example, if the number is 70, its reverse is 07 (or 7), and twice the reverse is 14. We need to check if 70 is one less than 14, which it is not.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, convert the number to a string to easily reverse its digits.
   - Reverse the string representation of the number.
   - Convert the reversed string back to an integer.
   - Multiply the reversed integer by 2.
   - Check if the original number is one less than this result.
   - Return `True` if it is, otherwise return `False`.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function check(n):
       convert n to string and reverse it
       convert the reversed string back to an integer, call it reversed_number
       calculate twice_reversed as 2 * reversed_number
