INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/731 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cone. The function will take two inputs: the radius \( r \) of the base of the cone and the height \( h \) of the cone. The function should return the lateral surface area as a floating-point number.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Formula**: The lateral surface area \( A \) of a cone can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \pi \times r \times l
   \]
   where \( l \) is the slant height of the cone. The slant height can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}
   \]

2. **Steps to Calculate**:
   - Calculate the slant height \( l \) using the formula \( l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2} \).
   - Use the slant height to calculate the lateral surface area using the formula \( A = \pi \times r \times l \).

3. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated lateral surface area.

## Pseudocode

```
function lateralsurface_cone(r, h):
    calculate slant height l = sqrt(r^2 + h^2)
    calculate lateral surface area A = Ï€ * r * l
    return A
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
import math

def lateralsurface_cone(r: float, h: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem
    l = math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)
    # Calculate the lateral surface area
    lateral_surface_area = math.pi * r * l
    # Return the lateral surface area
    return lateral_surface_area
```

[Textbook Reference Material]:
    Chapter: Geometry
    Section: Polygon area
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Polygon area}

    A general formula for calculating the area
    of a polygon, sometimes called the \key{shoelace formula},
    is as follows: \index{shoelace formula}
    \[\frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (p_i \times p_{i+1})| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|, \]
    Here the vertices are
    $p_1=(x_1,y_1)$, $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$, $\ldots$, $p_n=(x_n,y_n)$
    in such an order that
    $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ are adjacent vertices on the boundary
    of the polygon,
    and the first and last vertex is the same, i.e., $p_1=p_n$.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is
    \[\frac{|(2\cdot5-5\cdot4)+(5\cdot3-7\cdot5)+(7\cdot1-4\cdot3)+(4\cdot3-4\cdot1)+(4\cdot4-2\cdot3)|}{2} = 17/2.\]

    The idea of the formula is to go through trapezoids
    whose one side is a side of the polygon,
    and another side lies on the horizontal line $y=0$.
    For example:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \path[draw,fill=lightgray] (5,5.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (7,0) -- (5,0) -- (5,5.4);
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \draw (0,0) -- (10,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    The area of such a trapezoid is
    \[(x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2},\]
    where the vertices of the polygon are $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$.
    If $x_{i+1}>x_{i}$, the area is positive,
    and if $x_{i+1}<x_{i}$, the area is negative.

    The area of the polygon is the sum of areas of
    all such trapezoids, which yields the formula
    \[|\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2}| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|.\]

    Note that the absolute value of the sum is taken,
    because the value of the sum may be positive or negative,
    depending on whether we walk clockwise or counterclockwise
    along the boundary of the polygon.

    \subsubsection{Pick's theorem}

    \index{Pick's theorem}

    \key{Pick's theorem} provides another way to calculate
    the area of a polygon provided that all vertices 
    of the polygon have integer coordinates.
    According to Pick's theorem, the area of the polygon is
    \[ a + b/2 -1,\]
    where $a$ is the number of integer points inside the polygon
    and $b$ is the number of integer points on the boundary of the polygon.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);

    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (3,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,4.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,2.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,2.4) circle (2pt);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is $6+7/2-1=17/2$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/731 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cone. The function will take two inputs: the radius of the base of the cone (`r`) and the height of the cone (`h`). The function should return the lateral surface area as a floating-point number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The lateral surface area of a cone can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi \times r \times l
   \]
   where \( l \) is the slant height of the cone. The slant height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}
   \]
   Therefore, the steps to solve the problem are:
   - Calculate the slant height \( l \) using the formula \( l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2} \).
   - Use the slant height to calculate the lateral surface area using the formula \( \pi \times r \times l \).
   - Return the calculated lateral surface area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function lateralsurface_cone(r, h):
       calculate l as the square root of (r squared + h squared)
       calculate lateral_surface_area as Ï€ * r * l
       return lateral_surface_area
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def lateralsurface_cone(r: float, h: float) -> float:
    # Step 1: Calculate the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem
    l = (r**2 + h**2) ** 0.5

    lateral_surface_area = 3.141592653589793 * r * l
    
    # Step 3: Return the calculated lateral surface area
    return lateral_surface_area
