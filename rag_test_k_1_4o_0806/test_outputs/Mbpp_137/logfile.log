INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/137 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in a given list of integers. The function should return this ratio as a floating-point number.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Count Zeroes**: Traverse the list and count how many elements are zero.
2. **Count Non-Zeroes**: Calculate the number of non-zero elements by subtracting the count of zeroes from the total number of elements in the list.
3. **Calculate Ratio**: Compute the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes. If there are no non-zero elements, handle this case to avoid division by zero.
4. **Return the Ratio**: Return the calculated ratio as a floating-point number.

### Pseudocode

```
function zero_count(arr):
    zero_count = 0
    for each element in arr:
        if element is zero:
            increment zero_count
    non_zero_count = length of arr - zero_count
    if non_zero_count is zero:
        return 0.0
    else:
        return zero_count / non_zero_count
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def zero_count(arr):
    # Initialize the count of zeroes
    zero_count = 0
    
    # Count the number of zeroes in the array
    for num in arr:
        if num == 0:
            zero_count += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of non-zero elements
    non_zero_count = len(arr) - zero_count
    
    # If there are no non-zero elements, return 0.0 to avoid division by zero
    if non_zero_count == 0:
        return 0.0
    
    # Calculate and return the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes
    return zero_count / non_zero_count
```

This solution iterates through the list to count zeroes, calculates the number of non-zero elements, and then computes the ratio. It handles the edge case where there are no non-zero elements by returning 0.0.

    # Balanced Ternary

    This is a non-standard but still positional **numeral system**. Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.
    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,
    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the
    computers utilizing it.

    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:

    ```nohighlight
        0    0
        1    1
        2    1Z
        3    10
        4    11
        5    1ZZ
        6    1Z0
        7    1Z1
        8    10Z
        9    100
    ```

    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.

    ```nohighlight
        -1   Z
        -2   Z1
        -3   Z0
        -4   ZZ
        -5   Z11
    ```

    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.

    ## Conversion algorithm

    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is
    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,
    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -
    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.

    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.

    The final result is `1Z101`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \cdot 1 + 27 \cdot (-1) + 9 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$

    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.

    The final result is `100Z10`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \cdot 1 + 81 \cdot 0 + 27 \cdot 0 + 9 \cdot (-1) + 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$
