This will result in a new tuple that has all the elements of the original tuple and the dictionary as the last element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named add_dict_to_tuple that takes two parameters: a tuple and a dictionary.\n   Create a new tuple by concatenating the input tuple with a tuple containing the dictionary.\n   Return the new tuple.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef add_dict_to_tuple(t: tuple, d: dict) -> tuple:\n    # Concatenate the original tuple with a new tuple containing the dictionary\n    new_tuple = t + (d,)\n    # Return the new tuple\n    return new_tuple\n```",
