The function will accept two parameters: a tuple and a dictionary.\n2. We will create a new tuple by concatenating the original tuple with a single-element tuple containing the dictionary.\n3. The result will be a tuple that includes all the elements of the original tuple and the dictionary as the last element.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `add_dict_to_tuple` that takes two parameters: `input_tuple` and `input_dict`.\n2. Create a new tuple by concatenating `input_tuple` with a tuple containing `input_dict`.\n3. Return the new tuple.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef add_dict_to_tuple(input_tuple: tuple, input_dict: dict) -> tuple:\n    # Concatenate the input tuple with a tuple containing the input dictionary\n    result_tuple = input_tuple + (input_dict,)\n    # Return the resulting tuple\n    return result_tuple\n```"
