INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/306 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence from the start of a list up to a given index `i`, and this subsequence must also include a specific element at index `k` where `k > i`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Subsequence**: We need to find an increasing subsequence that starts from the beginning of the list and goes up to index `i`. This subsequence must also include the element at index `k`.

2. **Calculate the Maximum Sum**: For each element up to index `i`, calculate the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence that ends at that element. Then, check if this subsequence can be extended to include the element at index `k`.

3. **Include the kth Element**: For each subsequence ending at an index `j` (where `j <= i`), if the element at index `j` is less than the element at index `k`, add the element at index `k` to the sum of the subsequence ending at `j`.

4. **Find the Maximum**: The result will be the maximum sum obtained by including the element at index `k` in any of the valid subsequences.

### Pseudocode

```
function max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):
    initialize max_sum array of size i+1 with zeros

    for j from 0 to i:
        set max_sum[j] to arr[j]
        for m from 0 to j-1:
            if arr[m] < arr[j]:
                max_sum[j] = max(max_sum[j], max_sum[m] + arr[j])

    result = 0
    for j from 0 to i:
        if arr[j] < arr[k]:
            result = max(result, max_sum[j] + arr[k])

    return result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):
    # Initialize an array to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences
    # ending at each index up to i
    max_sum = [0] * (i + 1)
    
    # Calculate the maximum sum of increasing subsequences for each index up to i
    for j in range(i + 1):
        max_sum[j] = arr[j]
        for m in range(j):
            if arr[m] < arr[j]:
                max_sum[j] = max(max_sum[j], max_sum[m] + arr[j])
    
    # Find the maximum sum of subsequences that can be extended to include arr[k]
    result = 0
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[j] < arr[k]:
            result = max(result, max_sum[j] + arr[k])
    
    return result
```

This solution calculates the maximum sum of increasing subsequences up to index `i` and checks if they can be extended to include the element at index `k`. The result is the maximum sum of such subsequences.

    Our first problem is to find the

    in an array of $n$ elements.
    This is a maximum-length

    Let $\texttt{length}(k)$ denote
    the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position $k$.
    Thus, if we calculate all values of
    $\texttt{length}(k)$ where $0 \le k \le n-1$,
    we will find out the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence.
    For example, the values of the function
    for the above array are as follows:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{length}(0) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(4) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{length}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(6) & = & 4 \\
    \texttt{length}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{length}(6)=4$,
    because the longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position 6 consists of 4 elements.

    To calculate a value of $\texttt{length}(k)$,
    we should find a position $i<k$
    for which $\texttt{array}[i]<\texttt{array}[k]$
    and $\texttt{length}(i)$ is as large as possible.
    Then we know that
    $\texttt{length}(k)=\texttt{length}(i)+1$,
    because this is an optimal way to add
    $\texttt{array}[k]$ to a subsequence.
    However, if there is no such position $i$,
    then $\texttt{length}(k)=1$,
    which means that the subsequence only contains
    $\texttt{array}[k]$.

    Since all values of the function can be calculated
    from its smaller values,
    we can use dynamic programming.
    In the following code, the values
    of the function will be stored in an array
    $\texttt{length}$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        length[k] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (array[i] < array[k]) {
                length[k] = max(length[k],length[i]+1);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    This code works in $O(n^2)$ time,
    because it consists of two nested loops.
    However, it is also possible to implement
    the dynamic programming calculation
    more efficiently in $O(n \log n)$ time.
    Can you find a way to do this?
