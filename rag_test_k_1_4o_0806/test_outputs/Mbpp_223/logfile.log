## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given element is the majority element in a sorted array. The majority element is defined as an element that appears more than half the time in the array. The function should return `True` if the element is the majority element, and `False` otherwise.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Majority Element Condition**: For an element to be the majority, it must appear more than `n/2` times in the array, where `n` is the length of the array.

2. **Utilize the Sorted Property**: Since the array is sorted, if an element is the majority, it will appear consecutively in the array. This allows us to efficiently check for the majority element.

3. **Binary Search for First Occurrence**: Use binary search to find the first occurrence of the element in the array.

4. **Check the Count**: Once the first occurrence is found, check if the element appears more than `n/2` times by comparing the index of the first occurrence and the index `first_occurrence + n/2`.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a helper function `binary_search_first_occurrence` to find the first occurrence of the element using binary search.
2. In the main function `is_majority`, use the helper function to find the first occurrence of the element.
3. If the element is not found, return `False`.
4. Check if the element at the index `first_occurrence + n/2` is the same as the element.
5. Return `True` if it is the same, otherwise return `False`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def binary_search_first_occurrence(arr, n, element):
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    result = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == element:
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1  # Continue searching in the left half
        elif arr[mid] < element:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return result

def is_majority(arr, n, element):
    # Find the first occurrence of the element
    first_occurrence = binary_search_first_occurrence(arr, n, element)
    
    # If the element is not found, it cannot be the majority
    if first_occurrence == -1:
        return False
    
    # Check if the element appears more than n/2 times
    if first_occurrence + n // 2 < n and arr[first_occurrence + n // 2] == element:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This solution efficiently checks if the given element is the majority element by leveraging the sorted property of the array and using binary search to find the first occurrence of the element.

    \section{Binary search}

    \index{binary search}

    A general method for searching for an element
    in an array is to use a \texttt{for} loop
    that iterates through the elements of the array.
    For example, the following code searches for
    an element $x$ in an array:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (array[i] == x) {
            // x found at index i
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$,
    because in the worst case, it is necessary to check
    all elements of the array.
    If the order of the elements is arbitrary,
    this is also the best possible approach, because
    there is no additional information available where
    in the array we should search for the element $x$.

    However, if the array is \emph{sorted},
    the situation is different.
    In this case it is possible to perform the
    search much faster, because the order of the
    elements in the array guides the search.
    The following \key{binary search} algorithm
    efficiently searches for an element in a sorted array
    in $O(\log n)$ time.

    \subsubsection{Method 1}

    The usual way to implement binary search
    resembles looking for a word in a dictionary.
    The search maintains an active region in the array,
    which initially contains all array elements.
    Then, a number of steps is performed,
    each of which halves the size of the region.

    At each step, the search checks the middle element
    of the active region.
    If the middle element is the target element,
    the search terminates.
    Otherwise, the search recursively continues
    to the left or right half of the region,
    depending on the value of the middle element.

    The above idea can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a = 0, b = n-1;
    while (a <= b) {
        int k = (a+b)/2;
        if (array[k] == x) {
            // x found at index k
        }
        if (array[k] > x) b = k-1;
        else a = k+1;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    In this implementation, the active region is $a \ldots b$,
    and initially the region is $0 \ldots n-1$.
    The algorithm halves the size of the region at each step,
    so the time complexity is $O(\log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Method 2}

    An alternative method to implement binary search
    is based on an efficient way to iterate through
    the elements of the array.
    The idea is to make jumps and slow the speed
    when we get closer to the target element.

    The search goes through the array from left to
    right, and the initial jump length is $n/2$.
    At each step, the jump length will be halved:
    first $n/4$, then $n/8$, $n/16$, etc., until
    finally the length is 1.
    After the jumps, either the target element has
    been found or we know that it does not appear in the array.

    The following code implements the above idea:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int k = 0;
    for (int b = n/2; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (k+b < n && array[k+b] <= x) k += b;
    }
    if (array[k] == x) {
        // x found at index k
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    During the search, the variable $b$
    contains the current jump length.
    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(\log n)$,
    because the code in the \texttt{while} loop
    is performed at most twice for each jump length.

    \subsubsection{C++ functions}

    The C++ standard library contains the following functions
    that are based on binary search and work in logarithmic time:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{lower\_bound} returns a pointer to the
    first array element whose value is at least $x$.
    \item \texttt{upper\_bound} returns a pointer to the
    first array element whose value is larger than $x$.
    \item \texttt{equal\_range} returns both above pointers.
    \end{itemize}

    The functions assume that the array is sorted.
    If there is no such element, the pointer points to
    the element after the last array element.
    For example, the following code finds out whether
    an array contains an element with value $x$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto k = lower_bound(array,array+n,x)-array;
    if (k < n && array[k] == x) {
        // x found at index k
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Then, the following code counts the number of elements
    whose value is $x$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto a = lower_bound(array, array+n, x);
    auto b = upper_bound(array, array+n, x);
    cout << b-a << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    Using \texttt{equal\_range}, the code becomes shorter:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto r = equal_range(array, array+n, x);
    cout << r.second-r.first << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Finding the smallest solution}

    An important use for binary search is
    to find the position where the value of a \emph{function} changes.
    Suppose that we wish to find the smallest value $k$
    that is a valid solution for a problem.
    We are given a function $\texttt{ok}(x)$
    that returns \texttt{true} if $x$ is a valid solution
    and \texttt{false} otherwise.
    In addition, we know that $\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \texttt{false}
    when $x<k$ and \texttt{true} when $x \ge k$.
    The situation looks as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrr}
    $x$ & 0 & 1 & $\cdots$ & $k-1$ & $k$ & $k+1$ & $\cdots$ \\
    \hline
    $\texttt{ok}(x)$ & \texttt{false} & \texttt{false}
    & $\cdots$ & \texttt{false} & \texttt{true} & \texttt{true} & $\cdots$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \noindent
    Now, the value of $k$ can be found using binary search:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int x = -1;
    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (!ok(x+b)) x += b;
    }
    int k = x+1;
    \end{lstlisting}

    The search finds the largest value of $x$ for which
    $\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \texttt{false}.
    Thus, the next value $k=x+1$
    is the smallest possible value for which
    $\texttt{ok}(k)$ is \texttt{true}.
    The initial jump length $z$ has to be
    large enough, for example some value
    for which we know beforehand that $\texttt{ok}(z)$ is \texttt{true}.

    The algorithm calls the function \texttt{ok}
    $O(\log z)$ times, so the total time complexity
    depends on the function \texttt{ok}.
    For example, if the function works in $O(n)$ time,
    the total time complexity is $O(n \log z)$.

    \subsubsection{Finding the maximum value}

    Binary search can also be used to find
    the maximum value for a function that is
    first increasing and then decreasing.
    Our task is to find a position $k$ such that

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    $f(x)<f(x+1)$ when $x<k$, and
    \item
    $f(x)>f(x+1)$ when $x \ge k$.
    \end{itemize}

    The idea is to use binary search
    for finding the largest value of $x$
    for which $f(x)<f(x+1)$.
    This implies that $k=x+1$
    because $f(x+1)>f(x+2)$.
    The following code implements the search: 

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int x = -1;
    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (f(x+b) < f(x+b+1)) x += b;
    }
    int k = x+1;
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that unlike in the ordinary binary search,
    here it is not allowed that consecutive values
    of the function are equal.
    In this case it would not be possible to know
    how to continue the search.

   We need to determine if a given element is the majority element in a sorted array. A majority element is defined as an element that appears more than half the time in the array. The function should take a sorted array, its length, and the element in question, and return `True` if the element is the majority element, otherwise `False`.
