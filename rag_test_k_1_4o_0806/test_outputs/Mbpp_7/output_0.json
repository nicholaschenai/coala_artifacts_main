    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of words from that string which are at least 4 characters long.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, split the input string into individual words.\n   - Then, iterate over each word and check its length.\n   - If a word is 4 or more characters long, add it to a list.\n   - Finally, return the list of words that meet the length requirement.\n\n3. **Pseudocode:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_char_long(input_string):\n       split the input_string into a list of words\n       initialize an empty list to store words with 4 or more characters\n       for each word in the list of words:\n           if the length of the word is 4 or more:\n               add the word to the list of words with 4 or more characters\n       return the list of words with 4 or more characters\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_char_long(input_string: str) -> list:\n    # Split the input string into a list of words\n    words = input_string.split()\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store words with 4 or more characters\n    long_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the length of the word is 4 or more\n        if len(word) >= 4:\n            # Add the word to the list of long words\n            long_words.append(word)\n    \n    # Return the list of words with 4 or more characters\n    return long_words\n```",
