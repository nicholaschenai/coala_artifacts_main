INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given string expression containing brackets is balanced. An expression is considered balanced if every opening bracket has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing bracket. The types of brackets to consider are parentheses `()`, curly braces `{}`, and square brackets `[]`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. The stack will help us keep track of the opening brackets as we encounter them. When we encounter a closing bracket, we will check if it matches the most recent opening bracket stored in the stack. If it matches, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. If it doesn't match or if the stack is empty when we encounter a closing bracket, the expression is not balanced. At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is not.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Create a dictionary to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
3. Iterate over each character in the expression:
   - If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket:
     - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, return False (unbalanced).
     - Pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If it doesn't match, return False.
4. After iterating through the expression, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return True (balanced); otherwise, return False.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_expression(expression: str) -> bool:
    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    # Dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    # Iterate over each character in the expression
    for char in expression:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if char in bracket_map.values():
            stack.append(char)
        # If the character is a closing bracket
        elif char in bracket_map:
            # If the stack is empty, it means there's no matching opening bracket
            if not stack:
                return False
            # Pop the top element from the stack
            top_element = stack.pop()
            # Check if the popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket
            if bracket_map[char] != top_element:
                return False
    
    # If the stack is empty, all opening brackets have been matched
    return not stack
```

This solution uses a stack to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing bracket, thus determining if the expression is balanced.

    Title: Balanced bracket sequences
    Part: 1/2
    # Balanced bracket sequences

    A **balanced bracket sequence** is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence, when inserted certain numbers and mathematical operations, gives a valid mathematical expression.
    Formally you can define balanced bracket sequence with:

    - $e$ (the empty string) is a balanced bracket sequence.
    - if $s$ is a balanced bracket sequence, then so is $(s)$.
    - if $s$ and $t$ are balanced bracket sequences, then so is $s t$.

    For instance $(())()$ is a balanced bracket sequence, but $())($ is not.

    Of course you can define other bracket sequences also with multiple bracket types in a similar fashion.

    In this article we discuss some classic problems involving balanced bracket sequences (for simplicity we will only call them sequences): validation, number of sequences, finding the lexicographical next sequence, generating all sequences of a certain size, finding the index of sequence, and generating the $k$-th sequences.
    We will also discuss two variations for the problems, the simpler version when only one type of brackets is allowed, and the harder case when there are multiple types.

    ## Balance validation

    We want to check if a given string is balanced or not.

    At first suppose there is only one type of bracket.
    For this case there exists a very simple algorithm.
    Let $\text{depth}$ be the current number of open brackets.
    Initially $\text{depth} = 0$.
    We iterate over all character of the string, if the current bracket character is an opening bracket, then we increment $\text{depth}$, otherwise we decrement it.
    If at any time the variable $\text{depth}$ gets negative, or at the end it is different from $0$, then the string is not a balanced sequence.
    Otherwise it is.

    If there are several bracket types involved, then the algorithm needs to be changes.
    Instead of a counter $\text{depth}$ we create a stack, in which we will store all opening brackets that we meet.
    If the current bracket character is an opening one, we put it onto the stack.
    If it is a closing one, then we check if the stack is non-empty, and if the top element of the stack is of the same type as the current closing bracket.
    If both conditions are fulfilled, then we remove the opening bracket from the stack.
    If at any time one of the conditions is not fulfilled, or at the end the stack is not empty, then the string is not balanced.
    Otherwise it is.

    ## Number of balanced sequences

    ### Formula

    The number of balanced bracket sequences with only one bracket type can be calculated using the [Catalan numbers](catalan-numbers.md).
    The number of balanced bracket sequences of length $2n$ ($n$ pairs of brackets) is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$$

    If we allow $k$ types of brackets, then each pair be of any of the $k$ types (independently of the others), thus the number of balanced bracket sequences is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} k^n$$

    ### Dynamic programming

    On the other hand these numbers can be computed using **dynamic programming**.
    Let $d[n]$ be the number of regular bracket sequences with $n$ pairs of bracket.
    Note that in the first position there is always an opening bracket.
    And somewhere later is the corresponding closing bracket of the pair.
    It is clear that inside this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence, and similarly after this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence.
    So to compute $d[n]$, we will look at how many balanced sequences of $i$ pairs of brackets are inside this first bracket pair, and how many balanced sequences with $n-1-i$ pairs are after this pair.
    Consequently the formula has the form:

    $$d[n] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d[i] \cdot d[n-1-i]$$

    The initial value for this recurrence is $d[0] = 1$.

    ## Finding the lexicographical next balanced sequence

    Here we only consider the case with one valid bracket type.

    Given a balanced sequence, we have to find the next (in lexicographical order) balanced sequence.

    It should be obvious, that we have to find the rightmost opening bracket, which we can replace by a closing bracket without violation the condition, that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets up to this position.
    After replacing this position, we can fill the remaining part of the string with the lexicographically minimal one: i.e. first with as much opening brackets as possible, and then fill up the remaining positions with closing brackets.
    In other words we try to leave a long as possible prefix unchanged, and the suffix gets replaced by the lexicographically minimal one.

    To find this position, we can iterate over the character from right to left, and maintain the balance $\text{depth}$ of open and closing brackets.
    When we meet an opening brackets, we will decrement $\text{depth}$, and when we meet a closing bracket, we increase it.
    If we are at some point meet an opening bracket, and the balance after processing this symbol is positive, then we have found the rightmost position that we can change.
    We change the symbol, compute the number of opening and closing brackets that we have to add to the right side, and arrange them in the lexicographically minimal way.

    If we find do suitable position, then this sequence is already the maximal possible one, and there is no answer.

    ```{.cpp file=next_balanced_brackets_sequence}
    bool next_balanced_sequence(string & s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '(')
                depth--;
            else
                depth++;

            if (s[i] == '(' && depth > 0) {
                depth--;
                int open = (n - i - 1 - depth) / 2;
                int close = n - i - 1 - open;
                string next = s.substr(0, i) + ')' + string(open, '(') + string(close, ')');
                s.swap(next);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given string of brackets is balanced. A balanced string means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To determine if a string of brackets is balanced, we can use a stack data structure. As we iterate through each character in the string:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (like `{`, `(`, or `[`), we push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (like `}`, `)`, or `]`), we check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack is the matching opening bracket. If it is, we pop the stack. If not, the string is unbalanced.
   - At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, the string is balanced. If not, it is unbalanced.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function check_expression(expression):
       create an empty stack
       for each character in expression:
           if character is an opening bracket:
               push it onto the stack
           else if character is a closing bracket:
               if stack is empty or top of stack is not the matching opening bracket:
                   return False
               pop the stack
       return True if stack is empty, otherwise False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_expression(expression: str) -> bool:
    # Define a mapping of closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    # Initialize an empty list to use as a stack
    stack = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the expression
    for char in expression:
        # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if char in bracket_map.values():
            stack.append(char)
        # If the character is a closing bracket
        elif char in bracket_map:
            # Check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not the matching opening bracket
