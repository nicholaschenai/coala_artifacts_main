    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a string and an integer `k` as inputs. The function should return a new string where all words of length `k` have been removed from the original string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Split the input string into a list of words.\n   - Iterate over this list and filter out words that have a length equal to `k`.\n   - Join the remaining words back into a single string with spaces in between.\n   - Return the resulting string.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function remove_length(s, k):\n       split the string s into a list of words\n       create an empty list to store words that are not of length k\n       for each word in the list of words:\n           if the length of the word is not equal to k:\n               add the word to the new list\n       join the words in the new list into a single string with spaces\n       return the resulting string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_length(s: str, k: int) -> str:\n    # Split the input string into a list of words\n    words = s.split()\n    \n    # Filter out words that have a length equal to k\n    filtered_words = [word for word in words if len(word) != k]\n    \n    # Join the remaining words back into a single string with spaces\n    result = ' '.join(filtered_words)\n    \n    # Return the resulting string\n    return result\n```",
