INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/598 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Determine the number of digits**: Convert the number to a string to easily count the number of digits.
2. **Calculate the Armstrong sum**: For each digit in the number, raise it to the power of the total number of digits and sum these values.
3. **Compare the sum to the original number**: If the sum equals the original number, then it is an Armstrong number.

### Pseudocode

1. Convert the number to a string to determine the number of digits, `n`.
2. Initialize a variable `armstrong_sum` to 0.
3. For each digit in the string representation of the number:
   - Convert the digit back to an integer.
   - Raise it to the power of `n`.
   - Add the result to `armstrong_sum`.
4. Compare `armstrong_sum` with the original number.
5. Return `True` if they are equal, otherwise return `False`.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def armstrong_number(number: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the number to a string to easily iterate over digits
    num_str = str(number)
    # Determine the number of digits
    num_digits = len(num_str)
    # Initialize the sum of powers
    armstrong_sum = 0
    
    # Calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits
    for digit in num_str:
        armstrong_sum += int(digit) ** num_digits
    
    # Check if the calculated sum is equal to the original number
    return armstrong_sum == number
```

This function will correctly determine if a given number is an Armstrong number by following the steps outlined above.

2. Determine the number of digits by finding the length of the string.
3. Initialize a variable to store the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
