An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Determine the number of digits**: Convert the number to a string to easily count the number of digits.\n2. **Calculate the Armstrong sum**: For each digit in the number, raise it to the power of the total number of digits and sum these values.\n3. **Compare the sum to the original number**: If the sum equals the original number, then it is an Armstrong number.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Convert the number to a string to determine the number of digits, `n`.\n2. Initialize a variable `armstrong_sum` to 0.\n3. For each digit in the string representation of the number:\n   - Convert the digit back to an integer.\n   - Raise it to the power of `n`.\n   - Add the result to `armstrong_sum`.\n4. Compare `armstrong_sum` with the original number.\n5. Return `True` if they are equal, otherwise return `False`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef armstrong_number(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string to easily iterate over digits\n    num_str = str(number)\n    # Determine the number of digits\n    num_digits = len(num_str)\n    # Initialize the sum of powers\n    armstrong_sum = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits\n    for digit in num_str:\n        armstrong_sum += int(digit) ** num_digits\n    \n    # Check if the calculated sum is equal to the original number\n    return armstrong_sum == number\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if a given number is an Armstrong number by following the steps outlined above."
