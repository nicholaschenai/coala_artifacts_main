    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that determines if a given integer is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 9 is a perfect square because it is 3 squared.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if a number is a perfect square, we can take the square root of the number and check if the result is an integer. If the square root is an integer, then the number is a perfect square. Otherwise, it is not. We can achieve this by comparing the integer part of the square root with the square root itself.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function is_perfect_square(n):\n       If n is less than 0:\n           Return False\n       Calculate the integer square root of n\n       If the square of the integer square root equals n:\n           Return True\n       Else:\n           Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # If the number is negative, it cannot be a perfect square\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Calculate the integer square root of n\n    sqrt_n = int(n**0.5)\n    \n    # Check if the square of the integer square root equals n\n    return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the number is negative, as negative numbers cannot be perfect squares. It then calculates the integer square root of the number and checks if squaring this integer results in the original number. If it does, the number is a perfect square; otherwise, it is not.",
