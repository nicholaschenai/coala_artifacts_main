        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if a given integer is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 4 is a perfect square because it is 2 squared, and 9 is a perfect square because it is 3 squared.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output**: The function will take an integer as input and return a boolean value. The boolean will be `True` if the number is a perfect square and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Determine if a Number is a Perfect Square**:\n   - Calculate the integer square root of the number. This can be done by taking the square root of the number and converting it to an integer.\n   - Square the integer square root and check if it equals the original number.\n   - If it does, the number is a perfect square; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction is_perfect_square(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    integer_sqrt = integer part of the square root of n\n    if integer_sqrt * integer_sqrt == n:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Calculate the integer square root\n    integer_sqrt = int(n ** 0.5)\n    \n    # Check if the square of the integer square root equals the original number\n    return integer_sqrt * integer_sqrt == n\n```\n\nThis solution checks if a number is a perfect square by comparing the square of its integer square root to the original number. If they are equal, the number is a perfect square."

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 9 is a perfect square because it is 3 squared.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if a number is a perfect square, we can take the square root of the number and check if the result is an integer. If the square root is an integer, then the number is a perfect square. Otherwise, it is not. We can achieve this by comparing the integer part of the square root with the square root itself.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function is_perfect_square(n):\n       If n is less than 0:\n           Return False\n       Calculate the integer square root of n\n       If the square of the integer square root equals n:\n           Return True\n       Else:\n           Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # If the number is negative, it cannot be a perfect square\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Calculate the integer square root of n\n    sqrt_n = int(n**0.5)\n    \n    # Check if the square of the integer square root equals n\n    return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the number is negative, as negative numbers cannot be perfect squares. It then calculates the integer square root of the number and checks if squaring this integer results in the original number. If it does, the number is a perfect square; otherwise, it is not."
