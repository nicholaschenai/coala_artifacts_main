INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/803 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given integer is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 4 is a perfect square because it is 2 squared, and 9 is a perfect square because it is 3 squared.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Input and Output**: The function will take an integer as input and return a boolean value. The boolean will be `True` if the number is a perfect square and `False` otherwise.

2. **Determine if a Number is a Perfect Square**:
   - Calculate the integer square root of the number. This can be done by taking the square root of the number and converting it to an integer.
   - Square the integer square root and check if it equals the original number.
   - If it does, the number is a perfect square; otherwise, it is not.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_perfect_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    integer_sqrt = integer part of the square root of n
    if integer_sqrt * integer_sqrt == n:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:
    # Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares
    if n < 0:
        return False
    
    # Calculate the integer square root
    integer_sqrt = int(n ** 0.5)
    
    # Check if the square of the integer square root equals the original number
    return integer_sqrt * integer_sqrt == n
```

This solution checks if a number is a perfect square by comparing the square of its integer square root to the original number. If they are equal, the number is a perfect square.

   We need to write a function that determines if a given integer is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 9 is a perfect square because it is 3 squared.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To determine if a number is a perfect square, we can take the square root of the number and check if the result is an integer. If the square root is an integer, then the number is a perfect square. Otherwise, it is not. We can achieve this by comparing the integer part of the square root with the square root itself.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function is_perfect_square(n):
       If n is less than 0:
           Return False
       Calculate the integer square root of n
       If the square of the integer square root equals n:
           Return True
       Else:
           Return False
   ```

    # If the number is negative, it cannot be a perfect square

    sqrt_n = int(n**0.5)
    
    # Check if the square of the integer square root equals n
    return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n
```

This function first checks if the number is negative, as negative numbers cannot be perfect squares. It then calculates the integer square root of the number and checks if squaring this integer results in the original number. If it does, the number is a perfect square; otherwise, it is not.
