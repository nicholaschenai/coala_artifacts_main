    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2. In other words, we need to check if the number can be represented using only the binary digits 0 and 1, where each '1' represents a power of 2.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   A number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 if its binary representation consists only of the digits 0 and 1. This is because each '1' in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2. Therefore, the task is to check if the binary representation of the number contains only '1's and '0's, which is always true for any non-negative integer. Thus, the solution is to check if the number is greater than zero.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):\n       If n is less than or equal to 0:\n           Return False\n       Else:\n           Return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is less than or equal to 0\n    if n <= 0:\n        # If the number is less than or equal to 0, it cannot be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2\n        return False\n    else:\n        # If the number is greater than 0, it can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2\n        return True\n```\n\nThis function checks if the given number is greater than zero, which means it can be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2.",
