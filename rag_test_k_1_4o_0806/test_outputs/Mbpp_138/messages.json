        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2. For example, the number 10 can be expressed as \\(2^3 + 2^1\\) (which is 8 + 2), so the function should return `True` for 10.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - A number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 if its binary representation consists only of 0s and 1s. Each '1' in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2 that contributes to the sum.\n   - For example, the binary representation of 10 is `1010`, which corresponds to \\(2^3 + 2^1\\).\n   - Therefore, to solve the problem, we can convert the number to its binary form and check if it consists only of 0s and 1s. If it does, the number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):\n       if n is less than or equal to 0:\n           return False\n       while n is greater than 0:\n           if n is odd:\n               subtract 1 from n\n           else:\n               divide n by 2\n       return True\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n: int) -> bool:\n    # If the number is less than or equal to 0, it cannot be represented as a sum of positive powers of 2\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # While n is greater than 0, check each bit\n    while n > 0:\n        # If the least significant bit is 1, it means this bit contributes to the sum\n        if n % 2 == 1:\n            # Subtract 1 to remove the contribution of this power of 2\n            n -= 1\n        # Divide n by 2 to shift right and check the next bit\n        n //= 2\n    \n    # If we can reduce n to 0 by subtracting powers of 2, return True\n    return True\n```\n\nThis solution iteratively checks each bit of the number by using modulo and division operations, effectively simulating the process of checking the binary representation of the number. If the number can be reduced to zero by subtracting powers of 2, it returns `True`."

Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n \t\n    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.\n\n    Examples:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 01010000\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n | (n-1) = 01011111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    --------------------\n    ~n        = 10100111\n    ```\n\n    ### Shift operators\n\n    There are two operators for shifting bits.\n\n    -   $\\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.\n        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\gg 2 = 101_2 \\gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\\frac{5}{2^2} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1$.\n        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.\n\n    -   $\\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.\n        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\ll 3 = 101_2 \\ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \\cdot 2^3 = 5 \\cdot 8 = 40$.\n\n        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.\n\n\n    ## Useful tricks\n\n    ### Set/flip/clear a bit\n\n    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.\n    $1 \\ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\\sim(1 \\ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.\n\n    - $n ~|~ (1 \\ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\wedge~ (1 \\ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\&~ \\sim(1 \\ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n\n    ### Check if a bit is set\n\n    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {\n        return (number >> x) & 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2\n\n    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).\n    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.\n    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {\n        return n && !(n & (n - 1));\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Clear the most-right set bit\n\n    The expression $n ~\\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.\n    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.\n    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.\n\n    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 00110100\n    n-1       = 00110011\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 00110000\n    ```\n\n    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm\n\n    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.\n\n    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    int countSetBits(int n)\n    {\n        int count = 0;\n        while (n)\n        {\n            n = n & (n - 1);\n            count++;\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
