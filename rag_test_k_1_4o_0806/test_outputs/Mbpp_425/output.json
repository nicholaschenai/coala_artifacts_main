    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts how many sublists within a list contain a specific element. For example, if we have a list of sublists and we want to know how many of those sublists contain the number 1, the function should return that count.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - Iterate over each sublist in the main list.\n   - For each sublist, check if the specified element is present.\n   - If the element is found in the sublist, increment the counter by one.\n   - After checking all sublists, return the counter as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function count_element_in_list(list_of_sublists, element):\n       initialize counter to 0\n       for each sublist in list_of_sublists:\n           if element is in sublist:\n               increment counter by 1\n       return counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_element_in_list(list_of_sublists, element):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of sublists containing the element\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of sublists\n    for sublist in list_of_sublists:\n        # Check if the element is present in the current sublist\n        if element in sublist:\n            # Increment the counter if the element is found\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of sublists containing the element\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of sublists that contain the specified element by iterating through each sublist and checking for the presence of the element.",
