    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence. The sequence is defined as follows:\n   - P(1) = 1\n   - P(2) = 1\n   - For n > 2, P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n-P(n-1))\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence, we can use the recursive definition of the sequence. We will start by initializing the first two numbers of the sequence as 1. For any number greater than 2, we will calculate it using the formula P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n-P(n-1)). We will store the results in a list to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function sequence(n):\n       if n == 1 or n == 2:\n           return 1\n       create a list seq with n+1 elements initialized to 0\n       set seq[1] = 1\n       set seq[2] = 1\n       for i from 3 to n:\n           seq[i] = seq[seq[i-1]] + seq[i-seq[i-1]]\n       return seq[n]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sequence(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base cases for the sequence\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize a list to store the sequence values\n    seq = [0] * (n + 1)\n    seq[1] = 1\n    seq[2] = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the sequence values from 3 to n\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        seq[i] = seq[seq[i - 1]] + seq[i - seq[i - 1]]\n    \n    # Return the nth number in the sequence\n    return seq[n]\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `sequence` which calculates the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence using the recursive formula and dynamic programming to store intermediate results.",
