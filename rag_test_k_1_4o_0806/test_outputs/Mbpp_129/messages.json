A magic square is a grid of numbers where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Check Dimensions**: First, ensure the matrix is square (i.e., the number of rows equals the number of columns).\n2. **Calculate the Magic Sum**: Compute the sum of the first row. This will be the target sum that all other rows, columns, and diagonals should match.\n3. **Check Rows**: Verify that the sum of each row equals the magic sum.\n4. **Check Columns**: Verify that the sum of each column equals the magic sum.\n5. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that the sum of both the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) equals the magic sum.\n6. **Return Result**: If all checks pass, the matrix is a magic square; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction magic_square_test(matrix):\n    if not matrix or len(matrix) != len(matrix[0]):\n        return False\n    \n    n = len(matrix)\n    magic_sum = sum(matrix[0])\n    \n    for each row in matrix:\n        if sum(row) != magic_sum:\n            return False\n    \n    for col in range(n):\n        if sum(matrix[row][col] for row in range(n)) != magic_sum:\n            return False\n    \n    if sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:\n        return False\n    \n    if sum(matrix[i][n - 1 - i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef magic_square_test(matrix):\n    # Check if the matrix is empty or not square\n    if not matrix or len(matrix) != len(matrix[0]):\n        return False\n    \n    n = len(matrix)\n    # Calculate the magic sum using the first row\n    magic_sum = sum(matrix[0])\n    \n    # Check each row sum\n    for row in matrix:\n        if sum(row) != magic_sum:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check each column sum\n    for col in range(n):\n        if sum(matrix[row][col] for row in range(n)) != magic_sum:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check the main diagonal sum\n    if sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check the secondary diagonal sum\n    if sum(matrix[i][n - 1 - i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:\n        return False\n    \n    # If all checks pass, it is a magic square\n    return True\n```\n\nThis solution checks all necessary conditions for a matrix to be a magic square and returns `True` if it is, otherwise `False`."

On this board there are $15$ playing tiles numbered from 1 to 15. One cell is left empty (denoted by 0). You need to get the board to the position presented below by repeatedly moving one of the tiles to the free space:\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\ 13 & 14 & 15 & 0 \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    The game \"15 Puzzle\u201d was created by Noyes Chapman in 1880.\n\n    ## Existence Of The Solution\n\n    Let's consider this problem: given a position on the board, determine whether a sequence of moves which leads to a solution exists.\n\n    Suppose we have some position on the board:\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \\\\ a_5 & a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \\\\ a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    where one of the elements equals zero and indicates an empty cell $a_z  = 0$\n\n    Let\u2019s consider the permutation:\n\n    $$a_1 a_2 ... a_{z-1} a_{z+1} ... a_{15} a_{16}$$\n\n    i.e. the permutation of numbers corresponding to the position on the board without a zero element\n\n    Let $N$ be the number of inversions in this permutation (i.e. the number of such elements $a_i$  and $a_j$  that $i < j$, but $a_i  > a_j$).\n\n    Suppose $K$ is an index of a row where the empty element is located (i.e. using our convention, $K = (z - 1) \\div \\ 4 + 1$).\n\n    Then, **the solution exists iff $N + K$ is even**.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    The algorithm above can be illustrated with the following program code:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int a[16];\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        cin >> a[i];\n\n    int inv = 0;\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        if (a[i])\n            for (int j=0; j<i; ++j)\n                if (a[j] > a[i])\n                    ++inv;\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        if (a[i] == 0)\n            inv += 1 + i / 4;\n\n    puts ((inv & 1) ? \"No Solution\" : \"Solution Exists\");\n    ```\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    In 1879 Johnson proved that if $N + K$ is odd, then the solution doesn\u2019t exist, and in the same year Story proved that all positions when $N + K$ is even have a solution.\n\n    However, all these proofs were quite complex.\n\n    In 1999 Archer proposed a much simpler proof (you can download his article [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf)).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
