We need to determine if a given square matrix is a magic square. A magic square is a grid of numbers where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Check Dimensions**: First, ensure the matrix is square (i.e., the number of rows equals the number of columns).
2. **Calculate the Magic Sum**: Compute the sum of the first row. This will be the target sum that all other rows, columns, and diagonals should match.
3. **Check Rows**: Verify that the sum of each row equals the magic sum.
4. **Check Columns**: Verify that the sum of each column equals the magic sum.
5. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that the sum of both the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) equals the magic sum.
6. **Return Result**: If all checks pass, the matrix is a magic square; otherwise, it is not.

### Pseudocode

```
function magic_square_test(matrix):
    if not matrix or len(matrix) != len(matrix[0]):
        return False
    
    n = len(matrix)
    magic_sum = sum(matrix[0])
    
    for each row in matrix:
        if sum(row) != magic_sum:
            return False
    
    for col in range(n):
        if sum(matrix[row][col] for row in range(n)) != magic_sum:
            return False
    
    if sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:
        return False
    
    if sum(matrix[i][n - 1 - i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:
        return False
    
    return True
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def magic_square_test(matrix):
    # Check if the matrix is empty or not square
    if not matrix or len(matrix) != len(matrix[0]):
        return False
    
    n = len(matrix)
    # Calculate the magic sum using the first row
    magic_sum = sum(matrix[0])
    
    # Check each row sum
    for row in matrix:
        if sum(row) != magic_sum:
            return False
    
    # Check each column sum
    for col in range(n):
        if sum(matrix[row][col] for row in range(n)) != magic_sum:
            return False
    
    # Check the main diagonal sum
    if sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:
        return False
    
    # Check the secondary diagonal sum
    if sum(matrix[i][n - 1 - i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:
        return False
    
    # If all checks pass, it is a magic square
    return True
```

This solution checks all necessary conditions for a matrix to be a magic square and returns `True` if it is, otherwise `False`.

    # 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution

    This game is played on a $4 \times 4$ board. On this board there are $15$ playing tiles numbered from 1 to 15. One cell is left empty (denoted by 0). You need to get the board to the position presented below by repeatedly moving one of the tiles to the free space:

    $$\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\ 13 & 14 & 15 & 0 \end{matrix}$$

    The game "15 Puzzle‚Äù was created by Noyes Chapman in 1880.

    ## Existence Of The Solution

    Let's consider this problem: given a position on the board, determine whether a sequence of moves which leads to a solution exists.

    Suppose we have some position on the board:

    $$\begin{matrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \\ a_5 & a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \\ a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} \end{matrix}$$

    where one of the elements equals zero and indicates an empty cell $a_z  = 0$

    Let‚Äôs consider the permutation:

    $$a_1 a_2 ... a_{z-1} a_{z+1} ... a_{15} a_{16}$$

    i.e. the permutation of numbers corresponding to the position on the board without a zero element

    Let $N$ be the number of inversions in this permutation (i.e. the number of such elements $a_i$  and $a_j$  that $i < j$, but $a_i  > a_j$).

    Suppose $K$ is an index of a row where the empty element is located (i.e. using our convention, $K = (z - 1) \div \ 4 + 1$).

    Then, **the solution exists iff $N + K$ is even**.

    ## Implementation

    The algorithm above can be illustrated with the following program code:

    ```cpp
    int a[16];
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        cin >> a[i];

    int inv = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        if (a[i])
            for (int j=0; j<i; ++j)
                if (a[j] > a[i])
                    ++inv;
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        if (a[i] == 0)
            inv += 1 + i / 4;

    puts ((inv & 1) ? "No Solution" : "Solution Exists");
    ```

    ## Proof

    In 1879 Johnson proved that if $N + K$ is odd, then the solution doesn‚Äôt exist, and in the same year Story proved that all positions when $N + K$ is even have a solution.

    However, all these proofs were quite complex.

    In 1999 Archer proposed a much simpler proof (you can download his article [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf)).
