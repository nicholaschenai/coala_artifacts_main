INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/233 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder given its height and radius. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is the area of the side surface, excluding the top and bottom circles.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   The lateral surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Here, \(\pi\) (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159. We will use Python's built-in constant for \(\pi\) from the `math` module. The function will take two parameters: the radius and the height of the cylinder, and it will return the calculated lateral surface area.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Import the `math` module to access the constant \(\pi\).
   - Define a function `lateralsuface_cylinder` that takes two arguments: `height` and `radius`.
   - Inside the function, calculate the lateral surface area using the formula: \(2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \times \text{height}\).
   - Return the calculated lateral surface area.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
import math

def lateralsuface_cylinder(height: float, radius: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula: 2 * pi * radius * height
    lateral_surface_area = 2 * math.pi * radius * height
    # Return the calculated lateral surface area
    return lateral_surface_area
```

This code defines the function `lateralsuface_cylinder` which calculates and returns the lateral surface area of a cylinder using the given height and radius. The calculation uses the formula \(2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \times \text{height}\).

[Textbook Reference Material]:
    Chapter: Geometry
    Section: Polygon area
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Polygon area}

    A general formula for calculating the area
    of a polygon, sometimes called the \key{shoelace formula},
    is as follows: \index{shoelace formula}
    \[\frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (p_i \times p_{i+1})| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|, \]
    Here the vertices are
    $p_1=(x_1,y_1)$, $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$, $\ldots$, $p_n=(x_n,y_n)$
    in such an order that
    $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ are adjacent vertices on the boundary
    of the polygon,
    and the first and last vertex is the same, i.e., $p_1=p_n$.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is
    \[\frac{|(2\cdot5-5\cdot4)+(5\cdot3-7\cdot5)+(7\cdot1-4\cdot3)+(4\cdot3-4\cdot1)+(4\cdot4-2\cdot3)|}{2} = 17/2.\]

    The idea of the formula is to go through trapezoids
    whose one side is a side of the polygon,
    and another side lies on the horizontal line $y=0$.
    For example:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \path[draw,fill=lightgray] (5,5.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (7,0) -- (5,0) -- (5,5.4);
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \draw (0,0) -- (10,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    The area of such a trapezoid is
    \[(x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2},\]
    where the vertices of the polygon are $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$.
    If $x_{i+1}>x_{i}$, the area is positive,
    and if $x_{i+1}<x_{i}$, the area is negative.

    The area of the polygon is the sum of areas of
    all such trapezoids, which yields the formula
    \[|\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2}| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|.\]

    Note that the absolute value of the sum is taken,
    because the value of the sum may be positive or negative,
    depending on whether we walk clockwise or counterclockwise
    along the boundary of the polygon.

    \subsubsection{Pick's theorem}

    \index{Pick's theorem}

    \key{Pick's theorem} provides another way to calculate
    the area of a polygon provided that all vertices 
    of the polygon have integer coordinates.
    According to Pick's theorem, the area of the polygon is
    \[ a + b/2 -1,\]
    where $a$ is the number of integer points inside the polygon
    and $b$ is the number of integer points on the boundary of the polygon.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);

    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (3,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,4.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,2.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,2.4) circle (2pt);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is $6+7/2-1=17/2$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/233 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a Python function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder given its height and radius. The function should return a value that is close to the expected result when tested with specific inputs.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The lateral surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula: \(2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \times \text{height}\). This formula comes from the fact that the lateral surface of a cylinder is essentially a rectangle when "unwrapped", with one side being the height of the cylinder and the other side being the circumference of the base (which is \(2 \times \pi \times \text{radius}\)).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function lateralsuface_cylinder with parameters height and radius
       Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula: 2 * pi * radius * height
       Return the calculated lateral surface area
   ```
