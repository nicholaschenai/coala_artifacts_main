## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the smaller of the two numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - To solve this problem, we can compare the two numbers using a simple conditional statement. If the first number is less than or equal to the second number, we return the first number. Otherwise, we return the second number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `minimum` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
   - Inside the function, use an `if` statement to check if `a` is less than or equal to `b`.
     - If true, return `a`.
     - Otherwise, return `b`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def minimum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Check if the first number is less than or equal to the second number
    if a <= b:
        # If true, return the first number
        return a
    else:
        # Otherwise, return the second number
        return b
```

This function will correctly return the minimum of the two input numbers.

    Title: Linear Diophantine Equation
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    Once we have $l_x$ and $r_x$, it is also simple to enumerate through all the solutions. Just need to iterate through $x = l_x + k \cdot \frac{b}{g}$ for all $k \ge 0$ until $x = r_x$, and find the corresponding $y$ values using the equation $a x + b y = c$.

    ## Find the solution with minimum value of $x + y$ { data-toc-label='Find the solution with minimum value of <script type="math/tex">x + y</script>' }

    Here, $x$ and $y$ also need to be given some restriction, otherwise, the answer may become negative infinity.

    The idea is similar to previous section: We find any solution of the Diophantine equation, and then shift the solution to satisfy some conditions.

    Finally, use the knowledge of the set of all solutions to find the minimum:

    $$x' = x + k \cdot \frac{b}{g},$$

    $$y' = y - k \cdot \frac{a}{g}.$$

    Note that $x + y$ change as follows:

    $$x' + y' = x + y + k \cdot \left(\frac{b}{g} - \frac{a}{g}\right) = x + y + k \cdot \frac{b-a}{g}$$

    If $a < b$, we need to select smallest possible value of $k$. If $a > b$, we need to select the largest possible value of $k$. If $a = b$, all solution will have the same sum $x + y$.
