    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a Python function that takes two numbers as input and returns the smaller of the two numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To find the minimum of two numbers, we can compare the two numbers using a simple conditional statement. If the first number is less than or equal to the second number, then the first number is the minimum. Otherwise, the second number is the minimum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define a function named minimum that takes two parameters, a and b.\n   If a is less than or equal to b, return a.\n   Otherwise, return b.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef minimum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Check if the first number is less than or equal to the second number\n    if a <= b:\n        # If true, return the first number as it is the minimum\n        return a\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, return the second number as it is the minimum\n        return b\n```\n\nThis function uses a simple conditional statement to determine which of the two numbers is smaller and returns that number.",
