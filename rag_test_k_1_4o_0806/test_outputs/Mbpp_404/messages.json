If the first number is less than or equal to the second number, we return the first number. Otherwise, we return the second number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `minimum` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n   - Inside the function, use an `if` statement to check if `a` is less than or equal to `b`.\n     - If true, return `a`.\n     - Otherwise, return `b`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef minimum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Check if the first number is less than or equal to the second number\n    if a <= b:\n        # If true, return the first number\n        return a\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, return the second number\n        return b\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the minimum of the two input numbers."

Just need to iterate through $x = l_x + k \\cdot \\frac{b}{g}$ for all $k \\ge 0$ until $x = r_x$, and find the corresponding $y$ values using the equation $a x + b y = c$.\n\n    ## Find the solution with minimum value of $x + y$ { data-toc-label='Find the solution with minimum value of <script type=\"math/tex\">x + y</script>' }\n\n    Here, $x$ and $y$ also need to be given some restriction, otherwise, the answer may become negative infinity.\n\n    The idea is similar to previous section: We find any solution of the Diophantine equation, and then shift the solution to satisfy some conditions.\n\n    Finally, use the knowledge of the set of all solutions to find the minimum:\n\n    $$x' = x + k \\cdot \\frac{b}{g},$$\n\n    $$y' = y - k \\cdot \\frac{a}{g}.$$\n\n    Note that $x + y$ change as follows:\n\n    $$x' + y' = x + y + k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{b}{g} - \\frac{a}{g}\\right) = x + y + k \\cdot \\frac{b-a}{g}$$\n\n    If $a < b$, we need to select smallest possible value of $k$. If $a > b$, we need to select the largest possible value of $k$. If $a = b$, all solution will have the same sum $x + y$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
