INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/622 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The median is the middle value in a list of numbers. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Since both lists are sorted and of the same size, we can merge them into a single sorted list.
2. Once we have the merged sorted list, we can find the median.
3. If the total number of elements in the merged list is odd, the median is the middle element.
4. If the total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize two pointers, one for each list.
2. Create an empty list to store the merged elements.
3. While both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists:
   - Compare the elements at the current pointers.
   - Append the smaller element to the merged list and move the corresponding pointer forward.
4. If there are remaining elements in either list, append them to the merged list.
5. Calculate the median:
   - If the length of the merged list is odd, return the middle element.
   - If the length is even, return the average of the two middle elements.

### Python Code

```python
def get_median(arr1, arr2, n):
    # Initialize pointers for both arrays
    i, j = 0, 0
    # This will store the merged array
    merged = []
    
    # Merge the two arrays
    while i < n and j < n:
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            merged.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1
    
    # If there are remaining elements in arr1
    while i < n:
        merged.append(arr1[i])
        i += 1
    
    # If there are remaining elements in arr2
    while j < n:
        merged.append(arr2[j])
        j += 1
    
    # Calculate the median
    total_length = 2 * n
    if total_length % 2 == 1:
        # Odd length, return the middle element
        return float(merged[total_length // 2])
    else:
        # Even length, return the average of the two middle elements
        mid1 = total_length // 2 - 1
        mid2 = total_length // 2
        return (merged[mid1] + merged[mid2]) / 2.0

# Example usage
assert get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
```

This code merges the two sorted lists and then calculates the median of the merged list. The merging process ensures that the final list is sorted, allowing us to easily find the median.

    \section{Meet in the middle}

    \index{meet in the middle}

    \key{Meet in the middle} is a technique
    where the search space is divided into
    two parts of about equal size.
    A separate search is performed
    for both of the parts,
    and finally the results of the searches are combined.

    The technique can be used
    if there is an efficient way to combine the
    results of the searches.
    In such a situation, the two searches may require less
    time than one large search.
    Typically, we can turn a factor of $2^n$
    into a factor of $2^{n/2}$ using the meet in the
    middle technique.

    As an example, consider a problem where
    we are given a list of $n$ numbers and
    a number $x$,
    and we want to find out if it is possible
    to choose some numbers from the list so that
    their sum is $x$.
    For example, given the list $[2,4,5,9]$ and $x=15$,
    we can choose the numbers $[2,4,9]$ to get $2+4+9=15$.
    However, if $x=10$ for the same list,
    it is not possible to form the sum.

    A simple algorithm to the problem is to
    go through all subsets of the elements and
    check if the sum of any of the subsets is $x$.
    The running time of such an algorithm is $O(2^n)$,
    because there are $2^n$ subsets.
    However, using the meet in the middle technique,
    we can achieve a more efficient $O(2^{n/2})$ time algorithm\footnote{This
    idea was introduced in 1974 by E. Horowitz and S. Sahni \cite{hor74}.}.
    Note that $O(2^n)$ and $O(2^{n/2})$ are different
    complexities because $2^{n/2}$ equals $\sqrt{2^n}$.

    The idea is to divide the list into
    two lists $A$ and $B$ such that both
    lists contain about half of the numbers.
    The first search generates all subsets
    of $A$ and stores their sums to a list $S_A$.
    Correspondingly, the second search creates
    a list $S_B$ from $B$.
    After this, it suffices to check if it is possible
    to choose one element from $S_A$ and another
    element from $S_B$ such that their sum is $x$.
    This is possible exactly when there is a way to
    form the sum $x$ using the numbers of the original list.

    For example, suppose that the list is $[2,4,5,9]$ and $x=15$.
    First, we divide the list into $A=[2,4]$ and $B=[5,9]$.
    After this, we create lists
    $S_A=[0,2,4,6]$ and $S_B=[0,5,9,14]$.
    In this case, the sum $x=15$ is possible to form,
    because $S_A$ contains the sum $6$,
    $S_B$ contains the sum $9$, and $6+9=15$.
    This corresponds to the solution $[2,4,9]$.

    We can implement the algorithm so that
    its time complexity is $O(2^{n/2})$.
    First, we generate \emph{sorted} lists $S_A$ and $S_B$,
    which can be done in $O(2^{n/2})$ time using a merge-like technique.
    After this, since the lists are sorted,
    we can check in $O(2^{n/2})$ time if
    the sum $x$ can be created from $S_A$ and $S_B$.
