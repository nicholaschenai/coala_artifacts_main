The function should return `True` if the element is found and `False` otherwise.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will define a function named `check_tuplex` that takes two parameters: a tuple and an element to search for.\n   - We will use the `in` keyword in Python, which checks for the presence of an element in a collection, to determine if the element is in the tuple.\n   - If the element is found, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function check_tuplex with parameters tuple_data and element\n       Use the 'in' keyword to check if element is in tuple_data\n       Return the result of the check\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_tuplex(tuple_data: tuple, element) -> bool:\n    # Use the 'in' keyword to check if the element is in the tuple\n    return element in tuple_data\n```\n\nThis function will efficiently check for the presence of an element in a tuple using Python's built-in `in` keyword, which is both simple and effective for this task."
