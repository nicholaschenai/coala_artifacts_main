        "content": "Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.\n\n### 1. Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as input. Each list within the matrix represents a row. The function should sort the rows of the matrix based on the sum of the elements in each row, in ascending order.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n- For each row in the matrix, calculate the sum of its elements.\n- Use these sums to sort the rows of the matrix.\n- Return the matrix with its rows sorted by these sums.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction sort_matrix(matrix):\n    sort the matrix by the sum of each row\n    return the sorted matrix\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef sort_matrix(matrix):\n    # Sort the matrix using the sum of each row as the key\n    # The sorted function will sort the rows based on the sum of their elements\n    sorted_matrix = sorted(matrix, key=sum)\n    return sorted_matrix\n```\n\nThis solution uses Python's built-in `sorted` function, which allows us to specify a `key` function. By setting `key=sum`, we ensure that the rows are sorted based on the sum of their elements. The `sorted` function returns a new list that is sorted, which we then return as the result."

The rank is not only defined  for square matrices.\n\n    The rank of a matrix can also be defined as the largest order of any non-zero minor in the matrix.\n\n    Let the matrix be rectangular and have size $N \\times M$.\n    Note that if the matrix is square and its determinant is non-zero, then the rank is $N$ ($=M$); otherwise it will be less. Generally, the rank of a matrix does not exceed $\\min (N, M)$.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n\n    You can search for the rank using [Gaussian elimination](linear-system-gauss.md). We will perform the same operations as when solving the system or finding its determinant. But if at any step in the $i$-th column there are no rows with an non-empty entry among those that we didn't selected already, then we skip this step.\n    Otherwise, if we have found a row with a non-zero element in the $i$-th column during the $i$-th step, then we mark this row as a selected one, increase the rank by one (initially the rank is set equal to $0$), and perform the usual operations of taking this row away from the rest.\n\n    ## Complexity\n\n    This algorithm runs in $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```{.cpp file=matrix-rank}\n    const double EPS = 1E-9;\n\n    int compute_rank(vector<vector<double>> A) {\n        int n = A.size();\n        int m = A[0].size();\n\n        int rank = 0;\n        vector<bool> row_selected(n, false);\n        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {\n            int j;\n            for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {\n                if (!row_selected[j] && abs(A[j][i]) > EPS)\n                    break;\n            }\n\n            if (j != n) {\n                ++rank;\n                row_selected[j] = true;\n                for (int p = i + 1; p < m; ++p)\n                    A[j][p] /= A[j][i];\n                for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {\n                    if (k != j && abs(A[k][i]) > EPS) {\n                        for (int p = i + 1; p < m; ++p)\n                            A[k][p] -= A[j][p] * A[k][i];\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return rank;\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
