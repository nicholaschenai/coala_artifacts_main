INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/12 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to write a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as input. Each list within the matrix represents a row. The function should sort the rows of the matrix based on the sum of the elements in each row, in ascending order.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
- For each row in the matrix, calculate the sum of its elements.
- Use these sums to sort the rows of the matrix.
- Return the matrix with its rows sorted by these sums.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function sort_matrix(matrix):
    sort the matrix by the sum of each row
    return the sorted matrix
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def sort_matrix(matrix):
    # Sort the matrix using the sum of each row as the key
    # The sorted function will sort the rows based on the sum of their elements
    sorted_matrix = sorted(matrix, key=sum)
    return sorted_matrix
```

This solution uses Python's built-in `sorted` function, which allows us to specify a `key` function. By setting `key=sum`, we ensure that the rows are sorted based on the sum of their elements. The `sorted` function returns a new list that is sorted, which we then return as the result.

    Title: Finding the rank of a matrix
    Part: 1/1
    # Finding the rank of a matrix

    **The rank of a matrix** is the largest number of linearly independent rows/columns of the matrix. The rank is not only defined  for square matrices.

    The rank of a matrix can also be defined as the largest order of any non-zero minor in the matrix.

    Let the matrix be rectangular and have size $N \times M$.
    Note that if the matrix is square and its determinant is non-zero, then the rank is $N$ ($=M$); otherwise it will be less. Generally, the rank of a matrix does not exceed $\min (N, M)$.

    ## Algorithm

    You can search for the rank using [Gaussian elimination](linear-system-gauss.md). We will perform the same operations as when solving the system or finding its determinant. But if at any step in the $i$-th column there are no rows with an non-empty entry among those that we didn't selected already, then we skip this step.
    Otherwise, if we have found a row with a non-zero element in the $i$-th column during the $i$-th step, then we mark this row as a selected one, increase the rank by one (initially the rank is set equal to $0$), and perform the usual operations of taking this row away from the rest.

    ## Complexity

    This algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.

    ## Implementation

    ```{.cpp file=matrix-rank}
    const double EPS = 1E-9;

    int compute_rank(vector<vector<double>> A) {
        int n = A.size();
        int m = A[0].size();

        int rank = 0;
        vector<bool> row_selected(n, false);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            int j;
            for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (!row_selected[j] && abs(A[j][i]) > EPS)
                    break;
            }

            if (j != n) {
                ++rank;
                row_selected[j] = true;
                for (int p = i + 1; p < m; ++p)
                    A[j][p] /= A[j][i];
                for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                    if (k != j && abs(A[k][i]) > EPS) {
                        for (int p = i + 1; p < m; ++p)
                            A[k][p] -= A[j][p] * A[k][i];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return rank;
    }
    ```
