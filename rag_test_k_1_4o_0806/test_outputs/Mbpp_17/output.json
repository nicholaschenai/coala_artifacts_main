    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a square. The function will take the length of one side of the square as input and return the perimeter.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The perimeter of a square is the total length around the square. Since a square has four equal sides, the perimeter can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4. Therefore, the function should take the side length as input, multiply it by 4, and return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named square_perimeter that takes one parameter, side_length.\n   Calculate the perimeter by multiplying side_length by 4.\n   Return the calculated perimeter.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef square_perimeter(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the perimeter of the square by multiplying the side length by 4\n    perimeter = 4 * side_length\n    # Return the calculated perimeter\n    return perimeter\n```",
