    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple is the sum of two different tuples from the input list. The sum is calculated by adding the first elements of the two tuples and the second elements of the two tuples separately.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each pair of tuples in the input list.\n   - For each pair, we will calculate a new tuple where the first element is the sum of the first elements of the two tuples, and the second element is the sum of the second elements of the two tuples.\n   - We will store each resulting tuple in a list.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of these resulting tuples.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty list called result\n   For each tuple i in the list:\n       For each tuple j in the list:\n           If i is not the same as j:\n               Calculate the sum of the first elements of i and j\n               Calculate the sum of the second elements of i and j\n               Create a new tuple with these sums\n               Append the new tuple to the result list\n   Return the result list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_combinations(tuples_list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for i in range(len(tuples_list)):\n        # Iterate over each tuple again to form pairs\n        for j in range(len(tuples_list)):\n            # Ensure we are not pairing a tuple with itself\n            if i != j:\n                # Calculate the sum of the first elements and the second elements\n                sum_first = tuples_list[i][0] + tuples_list[j][0]\n                sum_second = tuples_list[i][1] + tuples_list[j][1]\n                # Create a new tuple with these sums\n                new_tuple = (sum_first, sum_second)\n                # Append the new tuple to the result list\n                result.append(new_tuple)\n    \n    # Return the list of resulting tuples\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all pairs of tuples in the input list, calculate the sum of their corresponding elements, and return a list of these sums as tuples.",
