    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the top 'n' largest products that can be formed by multiplying one number from each of two given lists. The function should return these products in descending order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, generate all possible products by multiplying each element from the first list with each element from the second list.\n   - Store these products in a list.\n   - Sort the list of products in descending order.\n   - Return the first 'n' elements from this sorted list, which will be the 'n' largest products.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function large_product(list1, list2, n):\n       initialize an empty list called products\n       for each element a in list1:\n           for each element b in list2:\n               calculate the product of a and b\n               append the product to the products list\n       sort the products list in descending order\n       return the first n elements from the sorted products list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef large_product(list1, list2, n):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the products\n    products = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the first list\n    for a in list1:\n        # Iterate over each element in the second list\n        for b in list2:\n            # Calculate the product of the current elements from both lists\n            product = a * b\n            # Append the product to the products list\n            products.append(product)\n    \n    # Sort the products list in descending order\n    products.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Return the first n elements from the sorted products list\n    return products[:n]\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates all possible products, sorts them, and retrieves the largest 'n' products as required.",
