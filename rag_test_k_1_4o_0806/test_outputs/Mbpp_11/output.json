    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a string and a character as inputs. The function should remove the first and last occurrence of the specified character from the string and return the modified string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, find the index of the first occurrence of the specified character in the string.\n   - Then, find the index of the last occurrence of the specified character in the string.\n   - If the character is found, remove the character at these indices.\n   - Return the modified string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function remove_Occ(s, char):\n       find the index of the first occurrence of char in s and store it in first_index\n       find the index of the last occurrence of char in s and store it in last_index\n       if first_index is not -1 (meaning char is found):\n           remove the character at first_index from s\n           if last_index is not the same as first_index:\n               adjust last_index to account for the removal of the first occurrence\n               remove the character at last_index from s\n       return the modified string s\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(s: str, char: str) -> str:\n    # Find the index of the first occurrence of the character\n    first_index = s.find(char)\n    \n    # Find the index of the last occurrence of the character\n    last_index = s.rfind(char)\n    \n    # If the character is found in the string\n    if first_index != -1:\n        # Remove the first occurrence\n        s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index+1:]\n        \n        # If the first and last occurrence are not the same, remove the last occurrence\n        if last_index != first_index:\n            # Adjust last_index because the string has been shortened by one character\n            last_index -= 1\n            # Remove the last occurrence\n            s = s[:last_index] + s[last_index+1:]\n    \n    # Return the modified string\n    return s\n```\n\nThis code will correctly remove the first and last occurrence of the specified character from the string, as required by the problem statement.",
