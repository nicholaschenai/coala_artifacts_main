    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that takes an integer as input and returns the number of '1's in its binary representation. This is also known as counting the number of set bits in the integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a simple method that involves repeatedly checking the least significant bit of the number. We can do this by using the bitwise AND operation with 1. If the result is 1, it means the least significant bit is set. We then right-shift the number by one bit to check the next bit. We continue this process until the number becomes zero, counting the number of set bits along the way.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter to 0\n   While the number is greater than 0:\n       If the least significant bit of the number is 1:\n           Increment the counter\n       Right-shift the number by 1 bit\n   Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of set bits\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Loop until the number becomes zero\n    while n > 0:\n        # Check if the least significant bit is set (i.e., is 1)\n        if n & 1:\n            # Increment the counter if the least significant bit is set\n            count += 1\n        \n        # Right-shift the number by 1 to check the next bit\n        n >>= 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of set bits\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of set bits in the binary representation of the given integer.",
