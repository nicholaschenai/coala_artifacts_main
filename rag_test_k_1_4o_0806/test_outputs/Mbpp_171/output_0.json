    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of one of its sides. A regular pentagon is a five-sided polygon where all sides are of equal length.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the perimeter of a regular pentagon, we simply multiply the length of one side by the number of sides, which is 5. This is because all sides of a regular pentagon are equal in length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n       return side_length * 5\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # A regular pentagon has 5 equal sides.\n    # The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides.\n    # Therefore, the perimeter is 5 times the length of one side.\n    return side_length * 5\n```",
