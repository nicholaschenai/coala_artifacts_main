    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string. This new string should only contain the characters from the original string that are located at even index positions (0, 2, 4, etc.).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate over the input string and collect characters that are at even indices. We can achieve this by using a loop that increments by 2, starting from index 0. This way, we only access characters at even positions. Finally, we concatenate these characters to form the resulting string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define a function odd_values_string that takes a string 's' as input.\n   Initialize an empty string 'result'.\n   Loop over the indices of 's' from 0 to the length of 's', incrementing by 2.\n       Append the character at the current index to 'result'.\n   Return 'result'.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_values_string(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = ''\n    # Iterate over the string with a step of 2 to get characters at even indices\n    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):\n        # Append the character at the current even index to the result\n        result += s[i]\n    # Return the final result string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return a new string containing only the characters from the even indices of the input string.",
