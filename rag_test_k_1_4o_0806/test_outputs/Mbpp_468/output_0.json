    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum product that can be formed by multiplying numbers from an increasing subsequence of a given array. An increasing subsequence is a sequence of numbers from the array where each number is greater than the previous one.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach similar to finding the longest increasing subsequence. We will maintain an array `max_product` where `max_product[i]` will store the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. We will iterate through the array, and for each element, we will check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence. If they can, we update the `max_product[i]` by multiplying the current element with the maximum product of the subsequence ending at the previous element. Finally, the result will be the maximum value in the `max_product` array.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_product(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       if n == 0:\n           return 0\n       \n       max_product = array of size n initialized to arr\n       \n       for i from 1 to n-1:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   max_product[i] = max(max_product[i], max_product[j] * arr[i])\n       \n       return maximum value in max_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # If the array is empty, return 0 as there is no subsequence\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Initialize max_product array with the same values as arr\n    max_product = arr[:]\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the array starting from the second element\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence\n        for j in range(i):\n            # If arr[j] is less than arr[i], it can be part of an increasing subsequence\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                # Update max_product[i] with the maximum product of subsequence ending at j\n                max_product[i] = max(max_product[i], max_product[j] * arr[i])\n    \n    # Return the maximum value in the max_product array\n    return max(max_product)\n```",
