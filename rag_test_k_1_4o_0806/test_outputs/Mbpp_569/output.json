    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. The function should sort each sublist alphabetically and return the modified list of lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate over each sublist in the main list. For each sublist, we will sort the strings in alphabetical order. After sorting all sublists, we will return the modified list of lists.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function sort_sublists that takes a list of lists as input.\n   For each sublist in the main list:\n       Sort the sublist alphabetically.\n   Return the modified list of lists.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sort_sublists(list_of_lists):\n    # Iterate over each sublist in the main list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Sort the current sublist alphabetically\n        sublist.sort()\n    # Return the modified list of lists\n    return list_of_lists\n```\n\nThis function will sort each sublist in the given list of lists alphabetically and return the modified list.",
