    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns a dictionary. In this dictionary, each unique list from the input is converted to a tuple, and the value associated with each tuple is the count of how many times that list appears in the input list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the results.\n   - Iterate over each sublist in the input list.\n   - Convert each sublist to a tuple (since lists cannot be dictionary keys, but tuples can).\n   - Check if this tuple is already a key in the dictionary:\n     - If it is, increment its associated value by 1.\n     - If it is not, add it to the dictionary with an initial value of 1.\n   - After processing all sublists, return the dictionary.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function unique_sublists(list_of_lists):\n       initialize an empty dictionary result_dict\n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           convert sublist to a tuple, call it tuple_key\n           if tuple_key is in result_dict:\n               increment the value associated with tuple_key by 1\n           else:\n               add tuple_key to result_dict with a value of 1\n       return result_dict\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef unique_sublists(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the result\n    result_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Convert the sublist to a tuple to use as a dictionary key\n        tuple_key = tuple(sublist)\n        \n        # Check if the tuple_key is already in the dictionary\n        if tuple_key in result_dict:\n            # If it is, increment its count\n            result_dict[tuple_key] += 1\n        else:\n            # If it is not, add it with an initial count of 1\n            result_dict[tuple_key] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary with tuples as keys and their counts as values\n    return result_dict\n```\n",
