    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple containing the elements that are not common between the two input tuples. In other words, we need to find the elements that are present in one tuple but not in the other.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the dissimilar elements between two tuples, we can:\n   - Convert each tuple to a set. This will allow us to easily find unique elements and perform set operations.\n   - Use the symmetric difference operation on the two sets. The symmetric difference will give us a set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.\n   - Convert the resulting set back to a tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n       set1 = convert tuple1 to a set\n       set2 = convert tuple2 to a set\n       dissimilar_set = symmetric difference of set1 and set2\n       dissimilar_tuple = convert dissimilar_set to a tuple\n       return dissimilar_tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Convert the first tuple to a set\n    set1 = set(tuple1)\n    # Convert the second tuple to a set\n    set2 = set(tuple2)\n    # Find the symmetric difference between the two sets\n    dissimilar_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n    # Convert the resulting set back to a tuple\n    dissimilar_tuple = tuple(dissimilar_set)\n    # Return the tuple of dissimilar elements\n    return dissimilar_tuple\n```",
