INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/607 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that searches for a specific substring (pattern) within a given string. The function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, its starting index, and its ending index in the original string.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Search for the Pattern**: We need to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string.
2. **Determine Indices**: Once the pattern is found, determine the starting and ending indices of this pattern in the string.
3. **Return the Result**: Return a tuple containing the found substring, the start index, and the end index.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `find_literals` that takes two parameters: `text` (the string to search) and `pattern` (the substring to find).
2. Use the `find` method of the string to locate the starting index of the pattern in the text.
3. If the pattern is found (i.e., the starting index is not -1):
   - Calculate the ending index as the starting index plus the length of the pattern.
   - Return a tuple containing the pattern, the starting index, and the ending index.
4. If the pattern is not found, return a tuple with empty string and two -1s to indicate no match.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_literals(text: str, pattern: str) -> tuple:
    # Find the starting index of the pattern in the text
    start_index = text.find(pattern)
    
    # Check if the pattern is found
    if start_index != -1:
        # Calculate the end index
        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)
        # Return the pattern, start index, and end index
        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)
    
    # If pattern is not found, return a tuple indicating no match
    return ("", -1, -1)
```

This solution uses the `find` method to locate the pattern in the text, calculates the indices, and returns the required tuple. If the pattern is not found, it returns a tuple with an empty string and indices set to -1.

    # Rabin-Karp Algorithm for string matching

    This algorithm is based on the concept of hashing, so if you are not familiar with string hashing, refer to the [string hashing](string-hashing.md) article.
 
    This algorithm was authored by Rabin and Karp in 1987.

    Problem: Given two strings - a pattern $s$ and a text $t$, determine if the pattern appears in the text and if it does, enumerate all its occurrences in $O(|s| + |t|)$ time.

    Algorithm: Calculate the hash for the pattern $s$.
    Calculate hash values for all the prefixes of the text $t$.
    Now, we can compare a substring of length $|s|$ with $s$ in constant time using the calculated hashes.
    So, compare each substring of length $|s|$ with the pattern. This will take a total of $O(|t|)$ time.
    Hence the final complexity of the algorithm is $O(|t| + |s|)$: $O(|s|)$ is required for calculating the hash of the pattern and $O(|t|)$ for comparing each substring of length $|s|$ with the pattern.

    ## Implementation
    ```{.cpp file=rabin_karp}
    vector<int> rabin_karp(string const& s, string const& t) {
        const int p = 31; 
        const int m = 1e9 + 9;
        int S = s.size(), T = t.size();

        vector<long long> p_pow(max(S, T)); 
        p_pow[0] = 1; 
        for (int i = 1; i < (int)p_pow.size(); i++) 
            p_pow[i] = (p_pow[i-1] * p) % m;

        vector<long long> h(T + 1, 0); 
        for (int i = 0; i < T; i++)
            h[i+1] = (h[i] + (t[i] - 'a' + 1) * p_pow[i]) % m; 
        long long h_s = 0; 
        for (int i = 0; i < S; i++) 
            h_s = (h_s + (s[i] - 'a' + 1) * p_pow[i]) % m; 

        vector<int> occurrences;
        for (int i = 0; i + S - 1 < T; i++) {
            long long cur_h = (h[i+S] + m - h[i]) % m;
            if (cur_h == h_s * p_pow[i] % m)
                occurrences.push_back(i);
        }
        return occurrences;
    }

   We need to create a function that searches for a specific substring (pattern) within a given string (text). The function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, its starting index, and its ending index in the text.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in string methods. We will:
   - Use the `find` method to locate the starting index of the pattern in the text.
   - If the pattern is found, calculate the ending index by adding the length of the pattern to the starting index.
   - Return the pattern, starting index, and ending index as a tuple.
   - If the pattern is not found, return a tuple indicating no match (e.g., `('', -1, -1)`).

   ```
   function find_literals(text, pattern):
       start_index = text.find(pattern)
       if start_index is not -1:
           end_index = start_index + length of pattern
           return (pattern, start_index, end_index)
