        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that searches for a specific substring (pattern) within a given string. The function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, its starting index, and its ending index in the original string.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Search for the Pattern**: We need to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string.\n2. **Determine Indices**: Once the pattern is found, determine the starting and ending indices of this pattern in the string.\n3. **Return the Result**: Return a tuple containing the found substring, the start index, and the end index.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `find_literals` that takes two parameters: `text` (the string to search) and `pattern` (the substring to find).\n2. Use the `find` method of the string to locate the starting index of the pattern in the text.\n3. If the pattern is found (i.e., the starting index is not -1):\n   - Calculate the ending index as the starting index plus the length of the pattern.\n   - Return a tuple containing the pattern, the starting index, and the ending index.\n4. If the pattern is not found, return a tuple with empty string and two -1s to indicate no match.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_literals(text: str, pattern: str) -> tuple:\n    # Find the starting index of the pattern in the text\n    start_index = text.find(pattern)\n    \n    # Check if the pattern is found\n    if start_index != -1:\n        # Calculate the end index\n        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)\n        # Return the pattern, start index, and end index\n        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)\n    \n    # If pattern is not found, return a tuple indicating no match\n    return (\"\", -1, -1)\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `find` method to locate the pattern in the text, calculates the indices, and returns the required tuple. If the pattern is not found, it returns a tuple with an empty string and indices set to -1."

This will take a total of $O(|t|)$ time.\n    Hence the final complexity of the algorithm is $O(|t| + |s|)$: $O(|s|)$ is required for calculating the hash of the pattern and $O(|t|)$ for comparing each substring of length $|s|$ with the pattern.\n\n    ## Implementation\n    ```{.cpp file=rabin_karp}\n    vector<int> rabin_karp(string const& s, string const& t) {\n        const int p = 31; \n        const int m = 1e9 + 9;\n        int S = s.size(), T = t.size();\n\n        vector<long long> p_pow(max(S, T)); \n        p_pow[0] = 1; \n        for (int i = 1; i < (int)p_pow.size(); i++) \n            p_pow[i] = (p_pow[i-1] * p) % m;\n\n        vector<long long> h(T + 1, 0); \n        for (int i = 0; i < T; i++)\n            h[i+1] = (h[i] + (t[i] - 'a' + 1) * p_pow[i]) % m; \n        long long h_s = 0; \n        for (int i = 0; i < S; i++) \n            h_s = (h_s + (s[i] - 'a' + 1) * p_pow[i]) % m; \n\n        vector<int> occurrences;\n        for (int i = 0; i + S - 1 < T; i++) {\n            long long cur_h = (h[i+S] + m - h[i]) % m;\n            if (cur_h == h_s * p_pow[i] % m)\n                occurrences.push_back(i);\n        }\n        return occurrences;\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, its starting index, and its ending index in the text.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in string methods. We will:\n   - Use the `find` method to locate the starting index of the pattern in the text.\n   - If the pattern is found, calculate the ending index by adding the length of the pattern to the starting index.\n   - Return the pattern, starting index, and ending index as a tuple.\n   - If the pattern is not found, return a tuple indicating no match (e.g., `('', -1, -1)`).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_literals(text, pattern):\n       start_index = text.find(pattern)\n       if start_index is not -1:\n           end_index = start_index + length of pattern\n           return (pattern, start_index, end_index)\n       else:\n           return ('', -1, -1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_literals(text: str, pattern: str) -> tuple:\n    # Find the starting index of the pattern in the text\n    start_index = text.find(pattern)\n    \n    # Check if the pattern was found\n    if start_index != -1:\n        # Calculate the ending index\n        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)\n        # Return the pattern, start index, and end index\n        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)\n    else:\n        # If pattern is not found, return a tuple indicating no match\n        return ('', -1, -1)\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `find` method to efficiently locate the pattern in the text and returns the required information in a tuple. If the pattern is not found, it returns a tuple with an empty string and indices set to -1."
