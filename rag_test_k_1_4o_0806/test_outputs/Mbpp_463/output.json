    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the subarray within a given array of integers that has the maximum product. The subarray can be of any length, including a single element. The array can contain both positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to consider the effect of negative numbers and zeros on the product. A negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa. A zero will reset the product to zero, which means we need to start a new subarray after a zero. We can keep track of the maximum product and the minimum product at each step because a negative number can turn the minimum product into a maximum product. We will iterate through the array, updating these products and keeping track of the maximum product found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize max_product to the first element of the array\n   Initialize current_max to the first element of the array\n   Initialize current_min to the first element of the array\n\n   For each element in the array starting from the second element:\n       If the element is negative, swap current_max and current_min\n       Update current_max to be the maximum of the element and current_max multiplied by the element\n       Update current_min to be the minimum of the element and current_min multiplied by the element\n       Update max_product to be the maximum of max_product and current_max\n\n   Return max_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_subarray_product(arr):\n    # Initialize the maximum product to the first element\n    max_product = arr[0]\n    # Initialize current maximum and minimum products to the first element\n    current_max = arr[0]\n    current_min = arr[0]\n\n    # Iterate through the array starting from the second element\n    for num in arr[1:]:\n        # If the current number is negative, swap current_max and current_min\n        if num < 0:\n            current_max, current_min = current_min, current_max\n        \n        # Update current_max to be the maximum of the current number and the product of current_max and the current number\n        current_max = max(num, current_max * num)\n        # Update current_min to be the minimum of the current number and the product of current_min and the current number\n        current_min = min(num, current_min * num)\n        \n        # Update max_product to be the maximum of itself and current_max\n        max_product = max(max_product, current_max)\n\n    # Return the maximum product found\n    return max_product\n```",
