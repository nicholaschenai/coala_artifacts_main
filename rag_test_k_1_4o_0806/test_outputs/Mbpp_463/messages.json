        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within a given array of integers. A subarray is a sequence of consecutive elements from the array. The task is to identify the subarray that yields the highest product when its elements are multiplied together.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing three variables: `max_product` to store the maximum product found so far, `current_max` to store the maximum product ending at the current position, and `current_min` to store the minimum product ending at the current position. The `current_min` is necessary because a negative number multiplied by a negative `current_min` can become a positive number, potentially leading to a new maximum product.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Array**: Loop through each element in the array. For each element:\n   - If the element is negative, swap `current_max` and `current_min` because multiplying by a negative number will flip the sign.\n   - Update `current_max` to be the maximum of the current element itself or the product of `current_max` and the current element.\n   - Update `current_min` to be the minimum of the current element itself or the product of `current_min` and the current element.\n   - Update `max_product` to be the maximum of `max_product` and `current_max`.\n\n3. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the array, `max_product` will contain the maximum product of any subarray.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_subarray_product(arr):\n    if arr is empty:\n        return 0\n    \n    max_product = arr[0]\n    current_max = arr[0]\n    current_min = arr[0]\n    \n    for each element num in arr starting from index 1:\n        if num is negative:\n            swap current_max and current_min\n        \n        current_max = max(num, current_max * num)\n        current_min = min(num, current_min * num)\n        \n        max_product = max(max_product, current_max)\n    \n    return max_product\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_subarray_product(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    max_product = arr[0]\n    current_max = arr[0]\n    current_min = arr[0]\n    \n    for num in arr[1:]:\n        if num < 0:\n            current_max, current_min = current_min, current_max\n        \n        current_max = max(num, current_max * num)\n        current_min = min(num, current_min * num)\n        \n        max_product = max(max_product, current_max)\n    \n    return max_product\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the maximum product subarray by maintaining running products and adjusting for negative numbers, ensuring that the maximum product is updated correctly as we iterate through the array."

It is required to find a subarray $a[l \\ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:\n\n    $$ \\max_{ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.\n    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\n    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.\n\n    ## Algorithm 1\n\n    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm is very simple.\n\n    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.\n\n    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \\ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.\n\n    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.\n\n    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.\n\n    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ \u2014 we will only need the current element from it.\n\n    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.\n\n    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        int cur = sum - min_sum;\n        if (cur > ans) {\n            ans = cur;\n            ans_l = min_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < min_sum) {\n            min_sum = sum;\n            min_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Algorithm 2\n\n    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.\n\n    **Proof:**\n\n    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum \u2014 so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.\n\n    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.\n\n    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a \"critical\" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \\ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.\n\n    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum);\n        sum = max(sum, 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        if (sum > ans) {\n            ans = sum;\n            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < 0) {\n            sum = 0;\n            minus_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

A negative number can turn a large negative product into a large positive product, and vice versa. A zero will reset the product to zero, which means we need to start a new subarray after a zero.
