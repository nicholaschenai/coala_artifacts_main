The function should return the number of pairs of numbers in the list that add up to the target sum. Each pair should be counted only once, and the order of numbers in the pair does not matter.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate through each number in the list.\n   - For each number, we will check if there is another number in the list that, when added to the current number, equals the target sum.\n   - We will keep track of the pairs we have already counted to avoid counting the same pair more than once.\n   - We will use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number in the list, which will help us efficiently find the complement of the current number that makes up the target sum.\n   - As we find valid pairs, we will increment a counter to keep track of the total number of pairs.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):\n       initialize a dictionary called frequency_map\n       initialize a counter called pair_count to 0\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           calculate the complement as target_sum - number\n           if complement is in frequency_map:\n               increment pair_count by the frequency of the complement\n           \n           if number is not in frequency_map:\n               add number to frequency_map with a count of 0\n           increment the count of number in frequency_map by 1\n       \n       return pair_count\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):\n    # Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number\n    frequency_map = {}\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of valid pairs\n    pair_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Calculate the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the target sum\n        complement = target_sum - number\n        \n        # If the complement is already in the frequency map, it means we have found valid pairs\n        if complement in frequency_map:\n            # Increment the pair count by the number of times the complement has appeared\n            pair_count += frequency_map[complement]\n        \n        # Update the frequency map with the current number\n        if number not in frequency_map:\n            frequency_map[number] = 0\n        frequency_map[number] += 1\n    \n    # Return the total number of pairs found\n    return pair_count\n```"

This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):\n    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:\n\n    $$N_0 = \\binom{25}{5}$$\n\n    We will now calculate the number of \"bad\" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The \"bad\" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.\n\n    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \\ge 9$, and all other $x_i \\ge 0 ~ (i \\ne k)$ (they may be $\\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:\n\n    $$ | A_k | = \\binom{16}{5} $$\n\n    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \\ne p$) is equal to:\n\n    $$ \\left| A_k \\cap A_p \\right| = \\binom{7}{5}$$\n\n    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.\n\n    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:\n\n    $$\\binom{25}{5} - \\left(\\binom{6}{1} \\cdot \\binom{16}{5} - \\binom{6}{2} \\cdot \\binom{7}{5}\\right) $$\n\n    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval\n\n    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).\n\n    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.\n\n    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\\cdots k)$.\n\n    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:\n\n    $$ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{ r }{ p_i } \\right\\rfloor $$\n\n    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.\n\n    Here is a C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int solve (int n, int r) {\n    \tvector<int> p;\n    \tfor (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)\n    \t\tif (n % i == 0) {\n    \t\t\tp.push_back (i);\n    \t\t\twhile (n % i == 0)\n    \t\t\t\tn /= i;\n    \t\t}\n    \tif (n > 1)\n    \t\tp.push_back (n);\n\n    \tint sum = 0;\n    \tfor (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {\n    \t\tint mult = 1,\n    \t\t\tbits = 0;\n    \t\tfor (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)\n    \t\t\tif (msk & (1<<i)) {\n    \t\t\t\t++bits;\n    \t\t\t\tmult *= p[i];\n    \t\t\t}\n\n    \t\tint cur = r / mult;\n    \t\tif (bits % 2 == 1)\n    \t\t\tsum += cur;\n    \t\telse\n    \t\t\tsum -= cur;\n    \t}\n\n    \treturn r - sum;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The function should return the number of pairs of numbers in the list that add up to the target sum. Each pair should be counted only once, and the order of numbers in the pair does not matter.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far and how many times each number has appeared. As we iterate through the list, for each number, we calculate the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the target sum. We then check if this complement has been seen before. If it has, we add the count of the complement to our total pair count. After checking, we update the dictionary with the current number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a dictionary to keep track of numbers and their counts\n   Initialize a variable to count the number of pairs\n\n   For each number in the list:\n       Calculate the complement needed to reach the target sum\n       If the complement is in the dictionary:\n           Add the count of the complement to the pair count\n       Update the dictionary with the current number\n\n   Return the total pair count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):\n    # Dictionary to store the count of each number\n    num_count = {}\n    # Variable to store the number of pairs\n    pair_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Calculate the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the target sum\n        complement = target_sum - number\n        \n        # If the complement is already in the dictionary, it means we can form pairs\n        if complement in num_count:\n            # Add the count of the complement to the pair count\n            pair_count += num_count[complement]\n        \n        # Update the dictionary with the current number\n        if number in num_count:\n            num_count[number] += 1\n        else:\n            num_count[number] = 1\n\n    # Return the total number of pairs\n    return pair_count\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently counts the number of pairs by using a dictionary to track the occurrences of each number, allowing us to find complements in constant time."
