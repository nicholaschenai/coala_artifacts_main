The task is to identify such a subsequence in the array and calculate the maximum possible sum of its elements.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Increasing Subsequences**: For each element in the array, calculate the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at that element. This can be done using dynamic programming by iterating over the array and keeping track of the maximum sum for each element.\n\n2. **Identify Decreasing Subsequences**: Similarly, for each element, calculate the maximum sum of a decreasing subsequence starting from that element. This can be done by iterating over the array in reverse order.\n\n3. **Combine Results**: For each element in the array, calculate the sum of the maximum increasing subsequence ending at that element and the maximum decreasing subsequence starting from that element, subtracting the element itself once (since it is counted in both subsequences).\n\n4. **Find Maximum Sum**: The result will be the maximum of these combined sums.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize two arrays `inc` and `dec` of the same length as the input array, filled with zeros.\n2. For each element `i` in the array:\n   - Calculate `inc[i]` as the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at `i`.\n3. For each element `i` in the array (in reverse order):\n   - Calculate `dec[i]` as the maximum sum of a decreasing subsequence starting from `i`.\n4. Initialize a variable `max_sum` to zero.\n5. For each element `i` in the array:\n   - Calculate the combined sum as `inc[i] + dec[i] - array[i]`.\n   - Update `max_sum` if this combined sum is greater than the current `max_sum`.\n6. Return `max_sum`.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef max_sum(array):\n    n = len(array)\n    \n    # Initialize arrays to store the maximum sum of increasing and decreasing subsequences\n    inc = [0] * n\n    dec = [0] * n\n    \n    # Calculate maximum sum of increasing subsequence ending at each element\n    for i in range(n):\n        inc[i] = array[i]\n        for j in range(i):\n            if array[j] < array[i]:\n                inc[i] = max(inc[i], inc[j] + array[i])\n    \n    # Calculate maximum sum of decreasing subsequence starting at each element\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        dec[i] = array[i]\n        for j in range(n-1, i, -1):\n            if array[j] < array[i]:\n                dec[i] = max(dec[i], dec[j] + array[i])\n    \n    # Find the maximum sum of bitonic subsequence\n    max_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, inc[i] + dec[i] - array[i])\n    \n    return max_sum\n```\n\nThis code follows the outlined steps to calculate the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in the given array."

example\n\n        $$\\begin{array}{ll}\n        a &= \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\} \\\\\n        d &= \\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\\}\n        \\end{array}$$\n\n        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\\}$ or $\\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\\{0, 1\\}$ having length 2.\n\n    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.\n    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.\n\n    So let the current index be $i$.\n    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \\dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.\n    Then there are two options:\n\n    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.\n\n    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.\n        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.\n\n        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.\n        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.\n  \n        $$d[i] = \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(1, \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)\\right)$$\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {\n                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;\n                    p[i] = j;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if (d[i] > ans) {\n                ans = d[i];\n                pos = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        vector<int> subseq;\n        while (pos != -1) {\n            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);\n            pos = p[pos];\n        }\n        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());\n        return subseq;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
