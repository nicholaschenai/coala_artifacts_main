    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that calculates the nth Bell number. The Bell number is a sequence of numbers that represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. For example, the 2nd Bell number is 2, which means there are 2 ways to partition a set of 2 elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth Bell number, we can use a triangular array known as Bell's triangle. The first element of each row in Bell's triangle is the last element of the previous row. Each subsequent element in the row is the sum of the element to the left and the element above it. The nth Bell number is the first element of the nth row.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a 2D list `bell` with size (n+1) x (n+1) filled with zeros\n   Set bell[0][0] = 1\n\n   For i from 1 to n:\n       Set bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]  # First element of the row\n       For j from 1 to i:\n           Set bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]  # Fill the row\n\n   Return bell[n][0]  # The nth Bell number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef bell_Number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize a 2D list to store Bell numbers\n    bell = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    # The first Bell number is 1\n    bell[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the Bell triangle\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        # The first element of each row is the last element of the previous row\n        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]\n        \n        # Fill the rest of the row\n        for j in range(1, i+1):\n            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]\n    \n    # The nth Bell number is the first element of the nth row\n    return bell[n][0]\n```\n\nThis code calculates the nth Bell number using Bell's triangle, which is a straightforward way to compute Bell numbers iteratively.",
