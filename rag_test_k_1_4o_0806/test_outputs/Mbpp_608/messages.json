        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth Bell number. The Bell number is a sequence of numbers that represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. For example, the 2nd Bell number is 2, which means there are 2 ways to partition a set of 2 elements.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth Bell number, we can use a triangular array known as Bell's triangle. The first element of each row in Bell's triangle is the last element of the previous row. Each subsequent element in the row is the sum of the element to the left and the element above it. The nth Bell number is the first element of the nth row.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function bell_Number(n):\n       Create a 2D list (triangle) with n+1 rows\n       Initialize the first element of the triangle as 1\n       \n       For each row i from 1 to n:\n           Set the first element of the row to the last element of the previous row\n           For each column j from 1 to i:\n               Set the current element to the sum of the element to the left and the element above\n       \n       Return the first element of the nth row\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef bell_Number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Create a 2D list (triangle) with n+1 rows\n    bell_triangle = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Initialize the first element of the triangle as 1\n    bell_triangle[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the Bell triangle\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Set the first element of the current row to the last element of the previous row\n        bell_triangle[i][0] = bell_triangle[i - 1][i - 1]\n        \n        # Fill the rest of the row\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            # Current element is the sum of the element to the left and the element above\n            bell_triangle[i][j] = bell_triangle[i][j - 1] + bell_triangle[i - 1][j - 1]\n    \n    # Return the first element of the nth row, which is the nth Bell number\n    return bell_triangle[n][0]\n```\n\nThis code calculates the nth Bell number using Bell's triangle, which is a straightforward and efficient way to compute Bell numbers."

Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
