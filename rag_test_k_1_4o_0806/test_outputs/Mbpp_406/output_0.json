    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that determines if a given integer has an odd parity. In this context, \"parity\" refers to whether a number is odd or even. The function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if a number is odd, we can use the modulus operator `%`. A number is odd if it leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Conversely, a number is even if it leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2. Therefore, we can check the parity of a number by evaluating `number % 2`. If the result is 1, the number is odd; otherwise, it is even.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_Parity(number):\n       if number % 2 == 1:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_Parity(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is odd by using the modulus operator\n    # If the remainder when divided by 2 is 1, the number is odd\n    if number % 2 == 1:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine the parity of the input number and return `True` if it is odd and `False` if it is even.",
