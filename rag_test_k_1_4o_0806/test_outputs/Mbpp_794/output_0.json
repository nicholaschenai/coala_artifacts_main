    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given string starts with the letter 'a', can have any characters in between, and ends with the letter 'b'.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to verify two conditions for the input string:\n   - The string must start with the letter 'a'.\n   - The string must end with the letter 'b'.\n   If both conditions are satisfied, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function text_starta_endb(s):\n       if the length of s is at least 2:\n           if the first character of s is 'a' and the last character of s is 'b':\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef text_starta_endb(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string has at least two characters\n    if len(s) >= 2:\n        # Check if the first character is 'a' and the last character is 'b'\n        if s[0] == 'a' and s[-1] == 'b':\n            return True\n    # Return False if any of the conditions are not met\n    return False\n```",
