    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of items, where each item is represented as a dictionary with a 'name' and a 'price', and an integer `n`. The function should return a list of the `n` most expensive items from the input list, sorted in descending order of their price.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to sort the list of items based on their 'price' in descending order.\n   - Once sorted, we can simply take the first `n` items from this sorted list, as they will be the most expensive.\n   - Return this list of `n` most expensive items.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function expensive_items(items, n):\n       Sort the items list in descending order based on the 'price' key\n       Select the first n items from the sorted list\n       Return the selected items\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef expensive_items(items, n):\n    # Sort the items in descending order based on the 'price' key\n    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)\n    # Select the first n items from the sorted list\n    most_expensive_items = sorted_items[:n]\n    # Return the selected items\n    return most_expensive_items\n```",
