INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/585 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an item with a 'name' and a 'price'. The function should also take an integer `n` and return a list of the `n` most expensive items from the input list, sorted by price in descending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, we need to sort the list of items based on their 'price' in descending order.
   - After sorting, we can simply take the first `n` items from this sorted list, as they will be the most expensive.
   - Return this list of `n` most expensive items.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function expensive_items(items, n):
       Sort the items list by 'price' in descending order
       Select the first n items from the sorted list
       Return the selected items
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def expensive_items(items, n):
    # Sort the items by 'price' in descending order
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: item['price'], reverse=True)
    # Select the first n items from the sorted list
    most_expensive_items = sorted_items[:n]
    # Return the selected items
    return most_expensive_items
```

    \index{greedy algorithm}

    A \key{greedy algorithm}
    constructs a solution to the problem
    by always making a choice that looks
    the best at the moment.
    A greedy algorithm never takes back
    its choices, but directly constructs
    the final solution.
    For this reason, greedy algorithms
    are usually very efficient.

    The difficulty in designing greedy algorithms
    is to find a greedy strategy
    that always produces an optimal solution
    to the problem.
    The locally optimal choices in a greedy
    algorithm should also be globally optimal.
    It is often difficult to argue that
    a greedy algorithm works.

    \section{Coin problem}

    As a first example, we consider a problem
    where we are given a set of coins
    and our task is to form a sum of money $n$
    using the coins.
    The values of the coins are
    $\texttt{coins}=\{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k\}$,
    and each coin can be used as many times we want.
    What is the minimum number of coins needed?

    For example, if the coins are the euro coins (in cents)
    \[\{1,2,5,10,20,50,100,200\}\]
    and $n=520$,
    we need at least four coins.
    The optimal solution is to select coins
    $200+200+100+20$ whose sum is 520.

    \subsubsection{Greedy algorithm}

    A simple greedy algorithm to the problem
    always selects the largest possible coin,
    until the required sum of money has been constructed.
    This algorithm works in the example case,
    because we first select two 200 cent coins,
    then one 100 cent coin and finally one 20 cent coin.
    But does this algorithm always work?

    It turns out that if the coins are the euro coins,
    the greedy algorithm \emph{always} works, i.e.,
    it always produces a solution with the fewest
    possible number of coins.
    The correctness of the algorithm can be
    shown as follows:

    First, each coin 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 appears
    at most once in an optimal solution,
    because if the
    solution would contain two such coins,
    we could replace them by one coin and
    obtain a better solution.
    For example, if the solution would contain
    coins $5+5$, we could replace them by coin $10$.

    In the same way, coins 2 and 20 appear
    at most twice in an optimal solution,
    because we could replace
    coins $2+2+2$ by coins $5+1$ and
    coins $20+20+20$ by coins $50+10$.
    Moreover, an optimal solution cannot contain
    coins $2+2+1$ or $20+20+10$,
    because we could replace them by coins $5$ and $50$.

    Using these observations,
    we can show for each coin $x$ that
    it is not possible to optimally construct
    a sum $x$ or any larger sum by only using coins
    that are smaller than $x$.
    For example, if $x=100$, the largest optimal
    sum using the smaller coins is  $50+20+20+5+2+2=99$.
    Thus, the greedy algorithm that always selects
    the largest coin produces the optimal solution.

    This example shows that it can be difficult
    to argue that a greedy algorithm works,
    even if the algorithm itself is simple.

    \subsubsection{General case}

    In the general case, the coin set can contain any coins
    and the greedy algorithm \emph{does not} necessarily produce
    an optimal solution.

    We can prove that a greedy algorithm does not work
    by showing a counterexample
    where the algorithm gives a wrong answer.
    In this problem we can easily find a counterexample:
    if the coins are $\{1,3,4\}$ and the target sum
    is 6, the greedy algorithm produces the solution
    $4+1+1$ while the optimal solution is $3+3$.

    It is not known if the general coin problem
    can be solved using any greedy algorithm\footnote{However, it is possible
    to \emph{check} in polynomial time
    if the greedy algorithm presented in this chapter works for
    a given set of coins \cite{pea05}.}.
    However, as we will see in Chapter 7,
    in some cases,
    the general problem can be efficiently
    solved using a dynamic
    programming algorithm that always gives the
    correct answer.
