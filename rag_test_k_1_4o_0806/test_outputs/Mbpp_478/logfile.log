### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and removes all lowercase substrings from it. A lowercase substring is any sequence of consecutive lowercase letters. The function should return the modified string with only the non-lowercase parts.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.
   - We will build a new string by adding only those characters that are not lowercase.
   - If a character is uppercase or not a letter, it will be added to the new string.
   - Finally, we will return the new string which will have all lowercase substrings removed.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function remove_lowercase with parameter input_string
       Initialize an empty string result
       For each character in input_string
           If the character is not lowercase
               Append the character to result
       Return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def remove_lowercase(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to store the result
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character is not lowercase
        if not char.islower():
            # Append the character to the result if it is not lowercase
            result += char
    
    # Return the result string with all lowercase substrings removed
    return result
```

This function will iterate through the input string, check each character to see if it is lowercase, and build a new string with only the non-lowercase characters. This effectively removes all lowercase substrings from the input.

    ### Shortest non-appearing string

    Given a string $S$ and a certain alphabet.
    We have to find a string of smallest length, that doesn't appear in $S$.

    We will apply dynamic programming on the suffix automaton built for the string $S$.

    Let $d[v]$ be the answer for the node $v$, i.e. we already processed part of the substring, are currently in the state $v$, and want to find the smallest number of characters that have to be added to find a non-existent transition.
    Computing $d[v]$ is very simple.
    If there is not transition using at least one character of the alphabet, then $d[v] = 1$.
    Otherwise one character is not enough, and so we need to take the minimum of all answers of all transitions:

    $$d[v] = 1 + \min_{w:(v,w,c) \in SA} d[w].$$

    The answer to the problem will be $d[t_0]$, and the actual string can be restored using the computed array $d[]$.

    ### Longest common substring of two strings

    Given two strings $S$ and $T$.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in $S$ and also in $T$.

    We construct a suffix automaton for the string $S$.

    We will now take the string $T$, and for each prefix look for the longest suffix of this prefix in $S$.
    In other words, for each position in the string $T$, we want to find the longest common substring of $S$ and $T$ ending in that position.

    For this we will use two variables, the **current state** $v$, and the **current length** $l$.
    These two variables will describe the current matching part: its length and the state that corresponds to it.

    Initially $v = t_0$ and $l = 0$, i.e. the match is empty.

    Now let us describe how we can add a character $T[i]$ and recalculate the answer for it.

      - If there is a transition from $v$ with the character $T[i]$, then we simply follow the transition and increase $l$ by one.
      - If there is no such transition, we have to shorten the current matching part, which means that we need to follow the suffix link: $v = link(v)$.
        At the same time, the current length has to be shortened.
        Obviously we need to assign $l = len(v)$, since after passing through the suffix link we end up in state whose corresponding longest string is a substring.
      - If there is still no transition using the required character, we repeat and again go through the suffix link and decrease $l$, until we find a transition or we reach the fictional state $-1$ (which means that the symbol $T[i]$ doesn't appear at all in $S$, so we assign $v = l = 0$).

    The answer to the task will be the maximum of all the values $l$.

    The complexity of this part is $O(length(T))$, since in one move we can either increase $l$ by one, or make several passes through the suffix links, each one ends up reducing the value $l$.

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    string lcs (string S, string T) {
        sa_init();
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++)
            sa_extend(S[i]);
 
        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {
            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st[v].link ;
                l = st[v].len;
            }
            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {
                v = st [v].next[T[i]];
                l++;
            }
            if (l > best) {
                best = l;
                bestpos = i;
            }
        }
        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);
    } 
    ```

    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings

    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.
    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.

    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):

    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \dots + S_k + D_k.$$

    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.

    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.
    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \dots, D_k$.

    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.
    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.
    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.
