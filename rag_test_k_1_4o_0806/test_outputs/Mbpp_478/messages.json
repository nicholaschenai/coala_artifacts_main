A lowercase substring is any sequence of consecutive lowercase letters. The function should return the modified string with only the non-lowercase parts.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.\n   - We will build a new string by adding only those characters that are not lowercase.\n   - If a character is uppercase or not a letter, it will be added to the new string.\n   - Finally, we will return the new string which will have all lowercase substrings removed.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function remove_lowercase with parameter input_string\n       Initialize an empty string result\n       For each character in input_string\n           If the character is not lowercase\n               Append the character to result\n       Return result\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_lowercase(input_string: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # Check if the character is not lowercase\n        if not char.islower():\n            # Append the character to the result if it is not lowercase\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the result string with all lowercase substrings removed\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will iterate through the input string, check each character to see if it is lowercase, and build a new string with only the non-lowercase characters. This effectively removes all lowercase substrings from the input."

i < S.size(); i++)\n            sa_extend(S[i]);\n \n        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {\n            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st[v].link ;\n                l = st[v].len;\n            }\n            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st [v].next[T[i]];\n                l++;\n            }\n            if (l > best) {\n                best = l;\n                bestpos = i;\n            }\n        }\n        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);\n    } \n    ```\n\n    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings\n\n    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.\n    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.\n\n    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):\n\n    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \\dots + S_k + D_k.$$\n\n    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.\n\n    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.\n    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \\dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \\dots, D_k$.\n\n    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.\n    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.\n    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
