The function should return a tuple containing the first two words that start with the letter 'p' or 'P' from the entire list of strings.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize a List**: Start with an empty list to store words that start with 'p' or 'P'.\n2. **Iterate Over Strings**: Loop through each string in the input list.\n3. **Split Words**: For each string, split it into individual words.\n4. **Check Words**: For each word, check if it starts with 'p' or 'P'.\n5. **Collect Words**: If a word starts with 'p' or 'P', add it to the list.\n6. **Return Result**: Once we have collected two words, return them as a tuple.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction start_withp(words_list):\n    Initialize an empty list called 'p_words'\n    For each string in words_list:\n        Split the string into individual words\n        For each word in the split words:\n            If the word starts with 'p' or 'P':\n                Add the word to 'p_words'\n                If the length of 'p_words' is 2:\n                    Return the first two elements of 'p_words' as a tuple\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef start_withp(words_list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store words starting with 'p' or 'P'\n    p_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each string in the input list\n    for string in words_list:\n        # Split the string into individual words\n        words = string.split()\n        \n        # Check each word\n        for word in words:\n            # If the word starts with 'p' or 'P', add it to the list\n            if word.lower().startswith('p'):\n                p_words.append(word)\n                \n                # If we have found two words, return them as a tuple\n                if len(p_words) == 2:\n                    return (p_words[0], p_words[1])\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list of strings, splits each string into words, and checks each word to see if it starts with 'p' or 'P'. It collects the first two such words and returns them as a tuple."
