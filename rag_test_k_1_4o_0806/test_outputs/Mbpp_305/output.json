    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of strings, where each string contains multiple words. The function should return a tuple containing the first two words that start with the letter 'p' or 'P' from the entire list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize an empty list to store words that start with 'p' or 'P'.\n   - Iterate over each string in the list.\n   - For each string, split it into individual words.\n   - Check each word to see if it starts with 'p' or 'P'.\n   - If it does, add it to the list of words that start with 'p'.\n   - Stop once we have found two such words.\n   - Return these two words as a tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function start_withp(words_list):\n       Initialize an empty list called 'p_words'\n       For each string in words_list:\n           Split the string into individual words\n           For each word in the split words:\n               If the word starts with 'p' or 'P':\n                   Add the word to 'p_words'\n                   If the length of 'p_words' is 2:\n                       Return the first two elements of 'p_words' as a tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef start_withp(words_list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store words starting with 'p' or 'P'\n    p_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each string in the input list\n    for string in words_list:\n        # Split the string into individual words\n        words = string.split()\n        \n        # Check each word\n        for word in words:\n            # If the word starts with 'p' or 'P', add it to the list\n            if word.lower().startswith('p'):\n                p_words.append(word)\n                \n                # If we have found two words, return them as a tuple\n                if len(p_words) == 2:\n                    return (p_words[0], p_words[1])\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find and return the first two words starting with 'p' or 'P' from the list of strings.",
