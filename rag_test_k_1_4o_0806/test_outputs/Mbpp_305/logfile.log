INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/305 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of strings as input. Each string contains multiple words separated by spaces. The function should return a tuple containing the first two words that start with the letter 'p' or 'P' from the entire list of strings.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize a List**: Start with an empty list to store words that start with 'p' or 'P'.
2. **Iterate Over Strings**: Loop through each string in the input list.
3. **Split Words**: For each string, split it into individual words.
4. **Check Words**: For each word, check if it starts with 'p' or 'P'.
5. **Collect Words**: If a word starts with 'p' or 'P', add it to the list.
6. **Return Result**: Once we have collected two words, return them as a tuple.

### Pseudocode

```
function start_withp(words_list):
    Initialize an empty list called 'p_words'
    For each string in words_list:
        Split the string into individual words
        For each word in the split words:
            If the word starts with 'p' or 'P':
                Add the word to 'p_words'
                If the length of 'p_words' is 2:
                    Return the first two elements of 'p_words' as a tuple
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def start_withp(words_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store words starting with 'p' or 'P'
    p_words = []
    
    # Iterate over each string in the input list
    for string in words_list:
        # Split the string into individual words
        words = string.split()
        
        # Check each word
        for word in words:
            # If the word starts with 'p' or 'P', add it to the list
            if word.lower().startswith('p'):
                p_words.append(word)
                
                # If we have found two words, return them as a tuple
                if len(p_words) == 2:
                    return (p_words[0], p_words[1])
```

This solution iterates through the list of strings, splits each string into words, and checks each word to see if it starts with 'p' or 'P'. It collects the first two such words and returns them as a tuple.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
