    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine how many numbers are odd when we rotate a given binary string a specified number of times. Each rotation involves moving the first character of the string to the end. We then convert each rotated binary string to a decimal number and check if it is odd.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start with the given binary string.\n   - For each rotation (up to the specified number of times):\n     - Rotate the string by moving the first character to the end.\n     - Convert the rotated binary string to a decimal number.\n     - Check if the decimal number is odd (a number is odd if its last binary digit is 1).\n     - Count how many of these numbers are odd.\n   - Return the count of odd numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function odd_Equivalent(binary_string, num_rotations):\n       count_odd = 0\n       for i from 0 to num_rotations - 1:\n           rotate the binary_string by 1 position to the left\n           convert the rotated binary_string to a decimal number\n           if the decimal number is odd:\n               increment count_odd\n       return count_odd\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_Equivalent(binary_string: str, num_rotations: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the count of odd numbers\n    count_odd = 0\n    \n    # Convert the binary string to a list for easy manipulation\n    binary_list = list(binary_string)\n    \n    # Perform the rotations\n    for _ in range(num_rotations):\n        # Rotate the binary string by moving the first character to the end\n        first_char = binary_list.pop(0)\n        binary_list.append(first_char)\n        \n        # Convert the rotated binary list back to a string\n        rotated_binary_string = ''.join(binary_list)\n        \n        # Convert the binary string to a decimal number\n        decimal_value = int(rotated_binary_string, 2)\n        \n        # Check if the decimal number is odd\n        if decimal_value % 2 == 1:\n            # Increment the count if the number is odd\n            count_odd += 1\n    \n    # Return the count of odd numbers\n    return count_odd\n```\n\nThis solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and uses basic string and list operations to achieve the desired result.",
