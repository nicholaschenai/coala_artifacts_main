Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains integers. The function should calculate the sum of all the integers in all the tuples and return this cumulative sum.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n- Initialize a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum, starting at zero.\n- Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n- For each tuple, iterate over each integer.\n- Add each integer to the cumulative sum.\n- After processing all tuples, return the cumulative sum.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction cummulative_sum(tuple_list):\n    initialize total_sum to 0\n    for each tuple in tuple_list:\n        for each number in tuple:\n            add number to total_sum\n    return total_sum\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef cummulative_sum(tuple_list):\n    # Initialize the cumulative sum to zero\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for tuple_ in tuple_list:\n        # Iterate over each number in the current tuple\n        for number in tuple_:\n            # Add the number to the cumulative sum\n            total_sum += number\n    \n    # Return the final cumulative sum\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the cumulative sum of all integers in the list of tuples, as required by the problem statement."
