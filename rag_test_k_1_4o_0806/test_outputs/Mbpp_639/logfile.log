INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/639 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of names as input. The function should remove any names that start with a lowercase letter, then calculate and return the sum of the lengths of the remaining names.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total length of the names that start with an uppercase letter.
2. Iterate through each name in the list.
3. For each name, check if the first character is an uppercase letter.
4. If it is, add the length of that name to the total length.
5. After iterating through all the names, return the total length.

## Pseudocode

```
function sample_nam(names):
    initialize total_length to 0
    for each name in names:
        if the first character of name is uppercase:
            add the length of name to total_length
    return total_length
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def sample_nam(names: list) -> int:
    # Initialize the total length to 0
    total_length = 0
    
    # Iterate over each name in the list
    for name in names:
        # Check if the first character of the name is uppercase
        if name[0].isupper():
            # Add the length of the name to the total length
            total_length += len(name)
    
    # Return the total length of names that start with an uppercase letter
    return total_length
```

    Part: 1/1
    # Length of the union of segments

    Given $n$ segments on a line, each described by a pair of coordinates $(a_{i1}, a_{i2})$.
    We have to find the length of their union.

    The following algorithm was proposed by Klee in 1977.
    It works in $O(n\log n)$ and has been proven to be the asymptotically optimal.

    ## Solution

    We store in an array $x$ the endpoints of all the segments sorted by their values.
    And additionally we store whether it is a left end or a right end of a segment.
    Now we iterate over the array, keeping a counter $c$ of currently opened segments.
    Whenever the current element is a left end, we increase this counter, and otherwise we decrease it.
    To compute the answer, we take the length between the last to $x$ values $x_i - x_{i-1}$, whenever we come to a new coordinate, and there is currently at least one segment is open.

    ## Implementation

    ```cpp
    int length_union(const vector<pair<int, int>> &a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<pair<int, bool>> x(n*2);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            x[i*2] = {a[i].first, false};
            x[i*2+1] = {a[i].second, true};
        }

        sort(x.begin(), x.end());

        int result = 0;
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
            if (i > 0 && x[i].first > x[i-1].first && c > 0)
                result += x[i].first - x[i-1].first;
            if (x[i].second)
                c--;
            else
                c++;
        }
        return result;
    }
    ```
