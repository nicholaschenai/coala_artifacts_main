    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a sentence as input and finds the first adverb in the sentence along with its start and end positions. An adverb is typically a word that ends with \"ly\". The function should return a tuple containing the start index, end index, and the adverb itself.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Split the sentence into words.\n   - Iterate over each word to check if it ends with \"ly\".\n   - If a word ends with \"ly\", determine its start and end positions in the original sentence.\n   - Return the start index, end index, and the adverb as a tuple.\n   - If no adverb is found, return `None`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_adverb_position(sentence):\n       split the sentence into words\n       initialize current_position to 0\n       for each word in words:\n           if the word ends with \"ly\":\n               calculate start_index as current_position\n               calculate end_index as start_index + length of word\n               return (start_index, end_index, word)\n           update current_position by adding length of word + 1 (for space)\n       return None\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str):\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    current_position = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each word\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word ends with \"ly\"\n        if word.endswith(\"ly\"):\n            # Calculate the start and end indices of the adverb\n            start_index = current_position\n            end_index = start_index + len(word)\n            # Return the start index, end index, and the adverb\n            return (start_index, end_index, word)\n        \n        # Update the current position by adding the length of the word and a space\n        current_position += len(word) + 1\n    \n    # Return None if no adverb is found\n    return None\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the words in the sentence, checks for the \"ly\" suffix, and calculates the positions based on the current index in the sentence.",
