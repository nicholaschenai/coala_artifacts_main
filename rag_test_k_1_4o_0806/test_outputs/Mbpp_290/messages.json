The first element of the tuple should be the length of the longest list, and the second element should be the longest list itself. If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, we can return any one of them.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found so far, starting with zero.\n   - Initialize another variable to store the list with the maximum length.\n   - Iterate over each list in the input list of lists.\n   - For each list, check its length.\n   - If the length of the current list is greater than the maximum length found so far, update the maximum length and store the current list as the longest list.\n   - After iterating through all lists, return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_length(list_of_lists):\n       max_len = 0\n       longest_list = []\n       \n       for each list in list_of_lists:\n           if length of list > max_len:\n               max_len = length of list\n               longest_list = list\n       \n       return (max_len, longest_list)\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_length(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize the maximum length to zero\n    max_len = 0\n    # Initialize the longest list as an empty list\n    longest_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        # Check if the current list's length is greater than the current maximum length\n        if len(lst) > max_len:\n            # Update the maximum length\n            max_len = len(lst)\n            # Update the longest list\n            longest_list = lst\n    \n    # Return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list\n    return (max_len, longest_list)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find and return the longest list and its length from a list of lists."

example\n\n        $$\\begin{array}{ll}\n        a &= \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\} \\\\\n        d &= \\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\\}\n        \\end{array}$$\n\n        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\\}$ or $\\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\\{0, 1\\}$ having length 2.\n\n    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.\n    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.\n\n    So let the current index be $i$.\n    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \\dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.\n    Then there are two options:\n\n    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.\n\n    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.\n        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.\n\n        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.\n        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.\n  \n        $$d[i] = \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(1, \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)\\right)$$\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {\n                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;\n                    p[i] = j;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if (d[i] > ans) {\n                ans = d[i];\n                pos = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        vector<int> subseq;\n        while (pos != -1) {\n            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);\n            pos = p[pos];\n        }\n        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());\n        return subseq;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
