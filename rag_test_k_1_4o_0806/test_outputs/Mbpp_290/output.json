    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the maximum length along with its length. If there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, we can return any one of them.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found so far and another variable to store the list with that maximum length.\n   - Iterate through each list in the list of lists.\n   - For each list, check its length.\n   - If the length of the current list is greater than the maximum length found so far, update the maximum length and store the current list as the list with the maximum length.\n   - After iterating through all the lists, return the maximum length and the corresponding list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_length(list_of_lists):\n       max_len = 0\n       max_list = []\n       \n       for each list in list_of_lists:\n           if length of list > max_len:\n               max_len = length of list\n               max_list = list\n       \n       return (max_len, max_list)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_length(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum length and the corresponding list\n    max_len = 0\n    max_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each list in the list of lists\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        # Check if the current list's length is greater than the maximum length found so far\n        if len(lst) > max_len:\n            # Update the maximum length and the corresponding list\n            max_len = len(lst)\n            max_list = lst\n    \n    # Return the maximum length and the corresponding list\n    return (max_len, max_list)\n```",
