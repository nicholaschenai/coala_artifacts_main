    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that finds all the \"ludic numbers\" that are less than or equal to a given integer. A ludic number is a number that remains after a specific sieving process, similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes used for finding prime numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find ludic numbers up to a given integer `n`, we start with a list of numbers from 1 to `n`. We then repeatedly remove numbers from this list using a sieving process:\n   - Start with the first number in the list (which is 1) and consider it as a ludic number.\n   - Remove every second number from the list starting from the second position.\n   - Move to the next number in the list that hasn't been removed, consider it as a ludic number, and remove every third number from the list starting from its position.\n   - Continue this process, each time moving to the next available number and removing every k-th number, where k is the position of the current number in the list.\n   - Stop when there are no more numbers to sieve.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function get_ludic(n):\n       create a list `numbers` containing integers from 1 to n\n       initialize an empty list `ludic_numbers`\n       \n       while `numbers` is not empty:\n           take the first number from `numbers` and add it to `ludic_numbers`\n           let `step` be the first number\n           remove every `step`-th number from `numbers`, starting from the position of the first number\n       \n       return `ludic_numbers`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n: int) -> list:\n    # Create a list of numbers from 1 to n\n    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))\n    # Initialize an empty list to store ludic numbers\n    ludic_numbers = []\n    \n    # Continue the process until there are no more numbers to sieve\n    while numbers:\n        # The first number in the list is a ludic number\n        first = numbers[0]\n        ludic_numbers.append(first)\n        \n        # Remove every `first`-th number from the list\n        # Start from the index `first` (1-based), which is `first - 1` in 0-based index\n        numbers = [num for i, num in enumerate(numbers) if (i + 1) % first != 0]\n    \n    return ludic_numbers\n```\n\nThis code implements the sieving process to find all ludic numbers up to a given integer `n`. It starts with a list of numbers from 1 to `n` and iteratively removes numbers according to the ludic number sieving rules.",
