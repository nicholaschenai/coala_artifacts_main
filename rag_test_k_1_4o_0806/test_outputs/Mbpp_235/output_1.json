    "raw_msg": "Let's fix the solution based on the insights from the previous analysis. The goal is to set all even bits of the given number `n` without assuming a fixed bit-width. We will only consider the bits that are part of the input number's binary representation.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize mask to 0\n    mask = 0\n    \n    # Determine the number of bits in the input number\n    num_bits = n.bit_length()\n    \n    # Set even bits in the mask up to the highest bit in n\n    for i in range(0, num_bits, 2):\n        mask |= (1 << i)\n    \n    # Set even bits in the input number using the mask\n    result = n | mask\n    \n    # Return the result\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`n.bit_length()`**: This function returns the number of bits required to represent the number `n` in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. This ensures we only consider the relevant bits of `n`.\n- **Loop `for i in range(0, num_bits, 2)`**: This loop iterates over even bit positions up to the highest bit position in `n`.\n- **`mask |= (1 << i)`**: This operation sets the `i`-th bit in the mask to 1.\n- **`result = n | mask`**: This operation sets all even bits in `n` to 1 by using the bitwise OR operation with the mask.\n- The function returns the modified number with all even bits set.",
