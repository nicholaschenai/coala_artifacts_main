    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns a new integer where all the even-positioned bits (0-indexed) of the input number are set to 1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to identify which bits are considered \"even\" in a binary representation. In a 0-indexed system, the even bits are at positions 0, 2, 4, 6, etc. We can create a mask where all these even bits are set to 1. Then, we can use the bitwise OR operation to set these bits in the input number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   - Initialize a variable `mask` to 0.\n   - For each even bit position `i` from 0 to a reasonable limit (e.g., 31 for a 32-bit integer):\n     - Set the `i`-th bit in `mask` using bitwise OR and left shift.\n   - Use the bitwise OR operation between the input number and `mask` to set all even bits.\n   - Return the result.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize mask to 0\n    mask = 0\n    \n    # Set even bits in the mask\n    for i in range(0, 32, 2):  # Assuming a 32-bit integer\n        mask |= (1 << i)\n    \n    # Set even bits in the input number using the mask\n    result = n | mask\n    \n    # Return the result\n    return result\n```\n\n- The loop `for i in range(0, 32, 2)` iterates over even indices from 0 to 30, setting the corresponding bits in the `mask`.\n- The bitwise OR operation `n | mask` ensures that all even bits in `n` are set to 1.\n- The function returns the modified number with all even bits set.",
