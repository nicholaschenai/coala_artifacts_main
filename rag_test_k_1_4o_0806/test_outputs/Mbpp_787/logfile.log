INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/787 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'a' followed immediately by exactly three 'b's. If the string contains this pattern, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and look for the pattern 'abbb'. We will check each character in the string to see if it is 'a', and if it is, we will check the next three characters to see if they are all 'b'. If we find such a pattern, we return `True`. If we reach the end of the string without finding the pattern, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function text_match_three with parameter text
       Loop through each character in text up to the length of text minus 3
           If the current character is 'a' and the next three characters are 'b'
               Return True
       Return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_match_three(text: str) -> bool:
    # Loop through each character in the string up to the length minus 3
    for i in range(len(text) - 3):
        # Check if the current character is 'a' and the next three are 'b'
        if text[i] == 'a' and text[i+1] == 'b' and text[i+2] == 'b' and text[i+3] == 'b':
            return True
    # If no such pattern is found, return False
    return False

    Title: Aho-Corasick algorithm
    Part: 1/3
    # Aho-Corasick algorithm

    The Aho-Corasick algorithm allows us to quickly search for multiple patterns in a text.
    The set of pattern strings is also called a _dictionary_.
    We will denote the total length of its constituent strings by $m$ and the size of the alphabet by $k$.
    The algorithm constructs a finite state automaton based on a trie in $O(m k)$ time and then uses it to process the text.

    The algorithm was proposed by Alfred Aho and Margaret Corasick in 1975.

    ## Construction of the trie

    <i>A trie based on words "Java", "Rad", "Rand", "Rau", "Raum" and "Rose".</i>

    Formally, a trie is a rooted tree, where each edge of the tree is labeled with some letter
    and outgoing edges of a vertex have distinct labels.

    We will identify each vertex in the trie with the string formed by the labels on the path from the root to that vertex.

    Each vertex will also have a flag $\text{output}$ which will be set
    if the vertex corresponds to a pattern in the dictionary.

    Accordingly, a trie for a set of strings is a trie such that each $\text{output}$ vertex corresponds to one string from the set, and conversely, each string of the set corresponds to one $\text{output}$ vertex.

    We now describe how to construct a trie for a given set of strings in linear time with respect to their total length.

    We introduce a structure for the vertices of the tree:
    ```{.cpp file=aho_corasick_trie_definition}
    const int K = 26;

    struct Vertex {
        int next[K];
        bool output = false;

        Vertex() {
            fill(begin(next), end(next), -1);
        }
    };

    vector<Vertex> trie(1);
    ```

    Here, we store the trie as an array of $\text{Vertex}$.
    Each $\text{Vertex}$ contains the flag $\text{output}$ and the edges in the form of an array $\text{next}[]$, where $\text{next}[i]$ is the index of the vertex that we reach by following the character $i$, or $-1$ if there is no such edge.
    Initially, the trie consists of only one vertex - the root - with the index $0$.

    Now we implement a function that will add a string $s$ to the trie.
    The implementation is simple:
    we start at the root node, and as long as there are edges corresponding to the characters of $s$ we follow them.
    If there is no edge for one character, we generate a new vertex and connect it with an edge.
    At the end of the process we mark the last vertex with the flag $\text{output}$.

    ```{.cpp file=aho_corasick_trie_add}
    void add_string(string const& s) {
        int v = 0;
        for (char ch : s) {
            int c = ch - 'a';
            if (trie[v].next[c] == -1) {
                trie[v].next[c] = trie.size();
                trie.emplace_back();
            }
            v = trie[v].next[c];
        }
        trie[v].output = true;
    }
