    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that checks if a given number is divisible by 11. The function should return `True` if the number is divisible by 11 and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11. We can implement this by iterating over the digits of the number, calculating the alternating sum, and checking if the result is divisible by 11.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function is_Diff(n):\n       Convert n to a string to iterate over each digit\n       Initialize two sums: odd_sum and even_sum to 0\n       For each digit in the string representation of n:\n           If the position of the digit is odd (1-based index):\n               Add the digit to odd_sum\n           Else:\n               Add the digit to even_sum\n       Calculate the difference: diff = odd_sum - even_sum\n       If diff is divisible by 11:\n           Return True\n       Else:\n           Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_Diff(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string to iterate over each digit\n    str_n = str(n)\n    \n    # Initialize sums for odd and even positioned digits\n    odd_sum = 0\n    even_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the digits with their index\n    for i, digit in enumerate(str_n):\n        # Convert the character to an integer\n        num = int(digit)\n        \n        # Check if the position is odd or even (1-based index)\n        if (i + 1) % 2 == 1:\n            # Add to odd_sum if the position is odd\n            odd_sum += num\n        else:\n            # Add to even_sum if the position is even\n            even_sum += num\n    \n    # Calculate the difference between odd_sum and even_sum\n    diff = odd_sum - even_sum\n    \n    # Check if the difference is divisible by 11\n    return diff % 11 == 0\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if a number is divisible by 11 using the alternating sum method.",
