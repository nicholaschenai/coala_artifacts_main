    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a square matrix where each cell has a specific cost. We need to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix. The path can only move right or down. Our goal is to find the path that has the maximum average cost, where the average is calculated as the total cost of the path divided by the number of cells in the path.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We'll create a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum total cost of reaching cell `(i, j)` from the top-left corner. We will initialize `dp[0][0]` with the cost of the top-left cell. For each cell `(i, j)`, we can only come from the left `(i, j-1)` or from above `(i-1, j)`. Therefore, the value of `dp[i][j]` will be the cost of the current cell plus the maximum of the values from the left or above. Once we fill the `dp` table, the maximum average path cost will be the value at `dp[N-1][N-1]` divided by the number of cells in the path, which is `2N-1` for an `N*N` matrix.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function maxAverageOfPath(matrix):\n       N = length of matrix\n       create a 2D list dp of size N*N initialized to 0\n       dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]\n       \n       for i from 0 to N-1:\n           for j from 0 to N-1:\n               if i > 0:\n                   dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + matrix[i][j])\n               if j > 0:\n                   dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + matrix[i][j])\n       \n       total_cost = dp[N-1][N-1]\n       number_of_cells = 2 * N - 1\n       return total_cost / number_of_cells\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef maxAverageOfPath(matrix):\n    N = len(matrix)\n    # Create a 2D list dp to store the maximum total cost to reach each cell\n    dp = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]\n    \n    # Initialize the starting point\n    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]\n    \n    # Fill the dp table\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if i > 0:\n                # Update dp[i][j] considering the path from above\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + matrix[i][j])\n            if j > 0:\n                # Update dp[i][j] considering the path from the left\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + matrix[i][j])\n    \n    # Calculate the total cost of the maximum path\n    total_cost = dp[N-1][N-1]\n    # Calculate the number of cells in the path\n    number_of_cells = 2 * N - 1\n    # Return the maximum average cost\n    return total_cost / number_of_cells\n```",
