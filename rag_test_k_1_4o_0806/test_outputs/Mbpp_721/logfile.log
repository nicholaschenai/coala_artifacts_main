INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/721 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a square matrix where each cell has a specific cost. We need to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix. The path can only move right or down. Our goal is to find the path that has the maximum average cost, where the average is calculated as the total cost of the path divided by the number of cells in the path.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. We'll maintain a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum total cost of reaching cell `(i, j)` from the top-left corner `(0, 0)`.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - Start by initializing `dp[0][0]` with the cost of the top-left cell, as this is the starting point.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, calculate the maximum cost to reach that cell by considering the maximum cost of reaching the cell from the top `(i-1, j)` or from the left `(i, j-1)`.
   - The formula will be: `dp[i][j] = cost[i][j] + max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

4. **Calculate the Average**:
   - The number of cells in any path from `(0, 0)` to `(N-1, N-1)` is `2N - 1`.
   - The maximum average cost will be `dp[N-1][N-1] / (2N - 1)`.

5. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated maximum average.

## Pseudocode

```
function maxAverageOfPath(cost):
    N = length of cost
    create a 2D list dp of size N x N
    dp[0][0] = cost[0][0]
    
    for i from 1 to N-1:
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
        dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1] + cost[0][i]
    
    for i from 1 to N-1:
        for j from 1 to N-1:
            dp[i][j] = cost[i][j] + max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    
    max_total_cost = dp[N-1][N-1]
    max_average = max_total_cost / (2 * N - 1)
    
    return max_average
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def maxAverageOfPath(cost):
    N = len(cost)
    dp = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]
    
    # Initialize the starting point
    dp[0][0] = cost[0][0]
    
    # Fill the first row and first column
    for i in range(1, N):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
        dp[0][i] = dp[0][i-1] + cost[0][i]
    
    # Fill the rest of the dp table
    for i in range(1, N):
        for j in range(1, N):
            dp[i][j] = cost[i][j] + max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    
    # Calculate the maximum average
    max_total_cost = dp[N-1][N-1]
    max_average = max_total_cost / (2 * N - 1)
    
    return max_average

    Title: Divide and Conquer DP
    Part: 1/1
    # Divide and Conquer DP

    Divide and Conquer is a dynamic programming optimization.

    ### Preconditions
    Some dynamic programming problems have a recurrence of this form: 

    $$
    dp(i, j) = \min_{0 \leq k \leq j} \\{ dp(i - 1, k - 1) + C(k, j) \\}
    $$

    where $C(k, j)$ is a cost function and $dp(i, j) = 0$ when $j \lt 0$. 

    Say $0 \leq i \lt m$ and $0 \leq j \lt n$, and evaluating $C$ takes $O(1)$
    time. Then the straightforward evaluation of the above recurrence is $O(m n^2)$. There
    are $m \times n$ states, and $n$ transitions for each state.

    Let $opt(i, j)$ be the value of $k$ that minimizes the above expression. Assuming that the 
    cost function satisfies the quadrangle inequality, we can show that 
    $opt(i, j) \leq opt(i, j + 1)$ for all $i, j$. This is known as the _monotonicity condition_. 
    Then, we can apply divide and conquer DP. The optimal
    "splitting point" for a fixed $i$ increases as $j$ increases.

    This lets us solve for all states more efficiently. Say we compute $opt(i, j)$
    for some fixed $i$ and $j$. Then for any $j' < j$ we know that $opt(i, j') \leq opt(i, j)$.
    This means when computing $opt(i, j')$, we don't have to consider as many
    splitting points!

    To minimize the runtime, we apply the idea behind divide and conquer. First,
    compute $opt(i, n / 2)$. Then, compute $opt(i, n / 4)$, knowing that it is less
    than or equal to $opt(i, n / 2)$ and $opt(i, 3 n / 4)$ knowing that it is
    greater than or equal to $opt(i, n / 2)$. By recursively keeping track of the
    lower and upper bounds on $opt$, we reach a $O(m n \log n)$ runtime. Each
    possible value of $opt(i, j)$ only appears in $\log n$ different nodes.

    Note that it doesn't matter how "balanced" $opt(i, j)$ is. Across a fixed
    level, each value of $k$ is used at most twice, and there are at most $\log n$
    levels.

    ## Generic implementation

    Even though implementation varies based on problem, here's a fairly generic
    template.
    The function `compute` computes one row $i$ of states `dp_cur`, given the previous row $i-1$ of states `dp_before`.
    It has to be called with `compute(0, n-1, 0, n-1)`. The function `solve` computes `m` rows and returns the result.

    ```{.cpp file=divide_and_conquer_dp}
    int m, n;
    vector<long long> dp_before(n), dp_cur(n);

    long long C(int i, int j);

    // compute dp_cur[l], ... dp_cur[r] (inclusive)
    void compute(int l, int r, int optl, int optr) {
        if (l > r)
            return;

        int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
        pair<long long, int> best = {LLONG_MAX, -1};

        for (int k = optl; k <= min(mid, optr); k++) {
            best = min(best, {(k ? dp_before[k - 1] : 0) + C(k, mid), k});
        }

        dp_cur[mid] = best.first;
        int opt = best.second;

        compute(l, mid - 1, optl, opt);
        compute(mid + 1, r, opt, optr);
    }

    int solve() {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            dp_before[i] = C(0, i);

        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            compute(0, n - 1, 0, n - 1);
            dp_before = dp_cur;
        }

        return dp_before[n - 1];
    }
    ```

    ### Things to look out for

    The greatest difficulty with Divide and Conquer DP problems is proving the
    monotonicity of $opt$. One special case where this is true is when the cost function satisfies the quadrangle inequality, i.e., $C(a, c) + C(b, d) \leq C(a, d) + C(b, c)$ for all $a \leq b \leq c \leq d$. 
    Many Divide and Conquer DP problems can also be solved with the Convex Hull trick or vice-versa. It is useful to know and understand
    both!

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/721 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a square matrix where each cell has a specific cost. We need to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix. The path can only move right or down. Our goal is to find the path that has the maximum average cost, where the average is calculated as the total cost of the path divided by the number of cells in the path.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We'll create a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum total cost of reaching cell `(i, j)` from the top-left corner. We will initialize `dp[0][0]` with the cost of the top-left cell. For each cell `(i, j)`, we can only come from the left `(i, j-1)` or from above `(i-1, j)`. Therefore, the value of `dp[i][j]` will be the cost of the current cell plus the maximum of the values from the left or above. Once we fill the `dp` table, the maximum average path cost will be the value at `dp[N-1][N-1]` divided by the number of cells in the path, which is `2N-1` for an `N*N` matrix.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function maxAverageOfPath(matrix):
       N = length of matrix
       create a 2D list dp of size N*N initialized to 0
       dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]
       
       for i from 0 to N-1:
           for j from 0 to N-1:
               if i > 0:

               if j > 0:
                   dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + matrix[i][j])
       
       total_cost = dp[N-1][N-1]
