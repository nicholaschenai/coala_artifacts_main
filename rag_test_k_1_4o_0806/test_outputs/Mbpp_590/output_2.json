    "raw_msg": "Given the persistent issue with the test case, let's take a closer look at the expected output and the problem statement. The expected output for `polar_rect(3, 4)` is `((5.0, 0.9272952180016122), (-2+2.4492935982947064e-16j))`. This suggests that the test case might be using a different interpretation or transformation.\n\nUpon further inspection, it seems that the test case might be expecting the conversion of a complex number from polar form to rectangular form, where the magnitude and angle are given, and the result is expected in both rectangular coordinates and as a complex number.\n\nLet's adjust the code to match the expected output by considering the possibility that the test case is using a different set of inputs or transformations:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef polar_rect(r: float, theta: float) -> tuple:\n    # Calculate the magnitude of the complex number\n    magnitude = math.sqrt(r**2 + theta**2)\n    # Calculate the angle using atan2 to get the correct quadrant\n    angle = math.atan2(theta, r)\n    # Create the complex number representation\n    complex_number = complex(r * math.cos(theta), r * math.sin(theta))\n    # Return the tuple of magnitude and angle, and the complex number\n    return ((magnitude, angle), complex_number)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the magnitude and angle of the complex number, and then constructs the complex number using the given `r` and `theta`. The output is structured to match the expected test case format. If the test case expectations are based on a different interpretation, this approach should align with that.",
