1] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. \n    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).\n\n    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:\n    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.\n    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).\n    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.\n\n    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:\n    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.\n    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).\n\n    ## Related tasks\n\n    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence\n\n    This is in fact nearly the same problem.\n    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.\n\n    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.\n    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.\n\n    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences\n\n    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.\n    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.\n\n    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.\n    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.\n\n    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.\n\n    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence\n\n    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \\dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.\n\n    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    **Proof**:\n    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.\n\n    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.\n    We need to prove that $x = y$.\n\n    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.\n    Therefore we have $y \\ge x$.\n\n    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.\n    Suppose that $y > x$.\n    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.\n    We transform this in set in the following way:\n    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.\n    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.\n    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.\n\n    Thus it follows that $y = x$.\n\n    **Restoring the sequences**:\n    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.\n    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
