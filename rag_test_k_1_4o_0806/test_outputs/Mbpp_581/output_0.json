    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that calculates the surface area of a square pyramid given its base edge length and height. The function should return the surface area as an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the surface area of a square pyramid, we need to calculate the area of its base and the area of its four triangular faces. The base is a square, so its area is the square of the base edge length. Each triangular face has a base equal to the base edge and a height that can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, considering the height of the pyramid and half of the base edge as the two legs of a right triangle. The surface area is the sum of the base area and the four triangular face areas.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function surface_Area(base_edge, height):\n       Calculate base_area as base_edge * base_edge\n       Calculate slant_height using the Pythagorean theorem: sqrt((base_edge / 2)^2 + height^2)\n       Calculate lateral_area as 4 * (0.5 * base_edge * slant_height)\n       Calculate total_surface_area as base_area + lateral_area\n       Return total_surface_area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef surface_Area(base_edge: int, height: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of the base (a square)\n    base_area = base_edge * base_edge\n    \n    # Calculate the slant height of the triangular faces using the Pythagorean theorem\n    slant_height = ((base_edge / 2) ** 2 + height ** 2) ** 0.5\n    \n    # Calculate the lateral surface area (area of the four triangular faces)\n    lateral_area = 4 * (0.5 * base_edge * slant_height)\n    \n    # Calculate the total surface area\n    total_surface_area = base_area + lateral_area\n    \n    # Return the total surface area as an integer\n    return int(total_surface_area)\n```",
