    "raw_msg": "Let's correct the solution by ensuring that the calculation of the surface area is accurate and that the result is properly rounded to match the expected output. The previous solution used `int()` to truncate the result, which might have caused the discrepancy. Using `round()` should address this issue.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef surface_Area(base_edge: int, height: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of the base (a square)\n    base_area = base_edge * base_edge\n    \n    # Calculate the slant height of the triangular faces using the Pythagorean theorem\n    slant_height = ((base_edge / 2) ** 2 + height ** 2) ** 0.5\n    \n    # Calculate the lateral surface area (area of the four triangular faces)\n    lateral_area = 4 * (0.5 * base_edge * slant_height)\n    \n    # Calculate the total surface area\n    total_surface_area = base_area + lateral_area\n    \n    # Return the total surface area rounded to the nearest integer\n    return round(total_surface_area)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the surface area of a square pyramid by:\n- Computing the base area as the square of the base edge.\n- Calculating the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem.\n- Determining the lateral surface area by summing the areas of the four triangular faces.\n- Summing the base area and lateral area to get the total surface area.\n- Rounding the result to the nearest integer to ensure it matches the expected output.",
