    "raw_msg": "Let's revisit the problem and the solution to identify the mistake and correct it.\n\n1. **Understanding the Surface Area Calculation:**\n   - The surface area of a square pyramid consists of the area of the square base and the area of the four triangular faces.\n   - The base area is straightforward: \\( \\text{base\\_area} = \\text{base\\_edge}^2 \\).\n   - The lateral surface area is the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. Each triangular face has a base equal to the base edge and a height equal to the slant height.\n\n2. **Slant Height Calculation:**\n   - The slant height is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. The slant height is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is half the base edge and the other leg is the height of the pyramid.\n   - Formula: \\( \\text{slant\\_height} = \\sqrt{(\\text{base\\_edge} / 2)^2 + \\text{height}^2} \\).\n\n3. **Lateral Surface Area Calculation:**\n   - The area of one triangular face is \\( 0.5 \\times \\text{base\\_edge} \\times \\text{slant\\_height} \\).\n   - The total lateral area is four times the area of one triangular face: \\( 4 \\times 0.5 \\times \\text{base\\_edge} \\times \\text{slant\\_height} \\).\n\n4. **Error Identification:**\n   - The error in the previous solution was due to the incorrect calculation of the lateral surface area. The formula used was correct, but the result was not rounded or truncated to an integer, which might have caused a discrepancy in the expected result.\n\n5. **Solution Correction:**\n   - Ensure that the final result is rounded or truncated to match the expected integer output.\n\nLet's correct the code to ensure it returns the expected integer value:\n\n```python\ndef surface_Area(base_edge: int, height: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of the base (a square)\n    base_area = base_edge * base_edge\n    \n    # Calculate the slant height of the triangular faces using the Pythagorean theorem\n    slant_height = ((base_edge / 2) ** 2 + height ** 2) ** 0.5\n    \n    # Calculate the lateral surface area (area of the four triangular faces)\n    lateral_area = 2 * base_edge * slant_height\n    \n    # Calculate the total surface area\n    total_surface_area = base_area + lateral_area\n    \n    # Return the total surface area rounded to the nearest integer\n    return int(total_surface_area)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the surface area of a square pyramid by:\n- Computing the base area as the square of the base edge.\n- Calculating the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem.\n- Determining the lateral surface area by summing the areas of the four triangular faces.\n- Summing the base area and lateral area to get the total surface area.\n- Rounding the result to the nearest integer to ensure it matches the expected output.",
