    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the first odd number from that list. If the list contains only odd numbers, the function should return the first element of the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list of numbers. For each number, we will check if it is odd. A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`). As soon as we find an odd number, we will return it immediately. If the list is guaranteed to have at least one odd number, we don't need to handle the case where no odd number is found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function first_odd(numbers):\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is odd:\n               return number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef first_odd(numbers):\n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            # Return the first odd number found\n            return number\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the first odd number from the list, as required by the problem statement.",
