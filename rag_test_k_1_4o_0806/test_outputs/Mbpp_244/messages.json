A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, find the integer part of the square root of the given number. This will give us the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given number.\n   - Increment this integer by 1 to get the next integer.\n   - Calculate the square of this new integer. This will be the next perfect square greater than the given number.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Compute the integer square root of the given number.\n   - Increment this integer by 1.\n   - Return the square of this incremented integer.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef next_Perfect_Square(n: int) -> int:\n    # Step 1: Find the integer part of the square root of n\n    root = int(n**0.5)\n    \n    # Step 2: Increment the root by 1 to find the next integer\n    next_root = root + 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the square of the next integer\n    return next_root * next_root\n```\n\nThis function calculates the next perfect square greater than the given number by following the steps outlined in the pseudocode."
