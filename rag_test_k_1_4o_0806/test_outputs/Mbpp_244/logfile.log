You are an expert programmer tasked with solving the problem below.

Follow the user's instructions to solve the problem.
The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to find the smallest perfect square that is greater than a given integer. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, find the integer part of the square root of the given number. This will give us the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given number.
   - Increment this integer by 1 to get the next integer.
   - Calculate the square of this new integer. This will be the next perfect square greater than the given number.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Compute the integer square root of the given number.
   - Increment this integer by 1.
   - Return the square of this incremented integer.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def next_Perfect_Square(n: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Find the integer part of the square root of n
    root = int(n**0.5)
    
    # Step 2: Increment the root by 1 to find the next integer
    next_root = root + 1
    
    # Step 3: Return the square of the next integer
    return next_root * next_root
```

This function calculates the next perfect square greater than the given number by following the steps outlined in the pseudocode.
