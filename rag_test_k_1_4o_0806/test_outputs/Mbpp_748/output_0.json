    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and inserts spaces before each word that starts with a capital letter. If the string is a single word starting with a capital letter, it should remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize an empty result string.\n   - Iterate through each character in the input string.\n   - If a character is a capital letter and it is not the first character, append a space to the result string before appending the character.\n   - Otherwise, just append the character to the result string.\n   - Return the result string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function capital_words_spaces(s):\n       initialize result as an empty string\n       for each character c in string s:\n           if c is uppercase and not the first character:\n               append a space to result\n           append c to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef capital_words_spaces(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty result string\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        # If the character is uppercase and not the first character, add a space\n        if c.isupper() and i != 0:\n            result += \" \"\n        # Append the current character to the result\n        result += c\n    \n    # Return the final result string\n    return result\n```",
