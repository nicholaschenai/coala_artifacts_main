    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the number that appears most frequently in the list. If there is a tie, we can return any one of the numbers with the highest frequency.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the list. We will iterate through the list, updating the count for each number in the dictionary. After counting all occurrences, we will find the number with the maximum count in the dictionary and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function max_occurrences with parameter lst\n       Create an empty dictionary called frequency_count\n       For each number in lst\n           If the number is not in frequency_count\n               Add the number to frequency_count with a count of 1\n           Else\n               Increment the count of the number in frequency_count\n       Initialize max_count to 0\n       Initialize max_item to None\n       For each key-value pair (number, count) in frequency_count\n           If count is greater than max_count\n               Set max_count to count\n               Set max_item to number\n       Return max_item\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_occurrences(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each number\n    frequency_count = {}\n    \n    # Count the occurrences of each number in the list\n    for number in lst:\n        if number not in frequency_count:\n            frequency_count[number] = 1\n        else:\n            frequency_count[number] += 1\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum frequency and the corresponding number\n    max_count = 0\n    max_item = None\n    \n    # Find the number with the maximum frequency\n    for number, count in frequency_count.items():\n        if count > max_count:\n            max_count = count\n            max_item = number\n    \n    # Return the number with the maximum frequency\n    return max_item\n```",
