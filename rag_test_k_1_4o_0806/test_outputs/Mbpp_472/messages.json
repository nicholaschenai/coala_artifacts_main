        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to determine if a given list of integers contains consecutive numbers. Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order, without any gaps. For example, the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is consecutive, but `[1, 3, 4, 5]` is not because there is a gap between 1 and 3.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - To check if a list contains consecutive numbers, we can first sort the list. Then, we iterate through the sorted list and check if each number is exactly one more than the previous number. If we find any number that is not one more than the previous number, the list is not consecutive. If we reach the end of the list without finding any such number, the list is consecutive.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Sort the list of numbers.\n   - Iterate through the sorted list from the first element to the second-to-last element.\n     - For each element, check if the next element is exactly one more than the current element.\n     - If any element does not satisfy this condition, return `False`.\n   - If all elements satisfy the condition, return `True`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(lst: list) -> bool:\n    # Step 1: Sort the list\n    lst.sort()\n    \n    # Step 2: Iterate through the sorted list\n    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):\n        # Step 3: Check if the next element is exactly one more than the current element\n        if lst[i] + 1 != lst[i + 1]:\n            # If not, the list is not consecutive\n            return False\n    \n    # Step 4: If all elements are consecutive, return True\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function sorts the list and checks for consecutive numbers by ensuring each number is followed by its successor. If any number is not followed by its successor, it returns `False`. If all numbers are consecutive, it returns `True`."

On this board there are $15$ playing tiles numbered from 1 to 15. One cell is left empty (denoted by 0). You need to get the board to the position presented below by repeatedly moving one of the tiles to the free space:\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\ 13 & 14 & 15 & 0 \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    The game \"15 Puzzle\u201d was created by Noyes Chapman in 1880.\n\n    ## Existence Of The Solution\n\n    Let's consider this problem: given a position on the board, determine whether a sequence of moves which leads to a solution exists.\n\n    Suppose we have some position on the board:\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \\\\ a_5 & a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \\\\ a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    where one of the elements equals zero and indicates an empty cell $a_z  = 0$\n\n    Let\u2019s consider the permutation:\n\n    $$a_1 a_2 ... a_{z-1} a_{z+1} ... a_{15} a_{16}$$\n\n    i.e. the permutation of numbers corresponding to the position on the board without a zero element\n\n    Let $N$ be the number of inversions in this permutation (i.e. the number of such elements $a_i$  and $a_j$  that $i < j$, but $a_i  > a_j$).\n\n    Suppose $K$ is an index of a row where the empty element is located (i.e. using our convention, $K = (z - 1) \\div \\ 4 + 1$).\n\n    Then, **the solution exists iff $N + K$ is even**.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    The algorithm above can be illustrated with the following program code:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int a[16];\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        cin >> a[i];\n\n    int inv = 0;\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        if (a[i])\n            for (int j=0; j<i; ++j)\n                if (a[j] > a[i])\n                    ++inv;\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        if (a[i] == 0)\n            inv += 1 + i / 4;\n\n    puts ((inv & 1) ? \"No Solution\" : \"Solution Exists\");\n    ```\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    In 1879 Johnson proved that if $N + K$ is odd, then the solution doesn\u2019t exist, and in the same year Story proved that all positions when $N + K$ is even have a solution.\n\n    However, all these proofs were quite complex.\n\n    In 1999 Archer proposed a much simpler proof (you can download his article [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf)).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
