INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/472 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to determine if a given list of integers contains consecutive numbers. Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order, without any gaps. For example, the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` is consecutive, but `[1, 3, 4, 5]` is not because there is a gap between 1 and 3.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To check if a list contains consecutive numbers, we can first sort the list. Then, we iterate through the sorted list and check if each number is exactly one more than the previous number. If we find any number that is not one more than the previous number, the list is not consecutive. If we reach the end of the list without finding any such number, the list is consecutive.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Sort the list of numbers.
   - Iterate through the sorted list from the first element to the second-to-last element.
     - For each element, check if the next element is exactly one more than the current element.
     - If any element does not satisfy this condition, return `False`.
   - If all elements satisfy the condition, return `True`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_Consecutive(lst: list) -> bool:
    # Step 1: Sort the list
    lst.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the sorted list
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        # Step 3: Check if the next element is exactly one more than the current element
        if lst[i] + 1 != lst[i + 1]:
            # If not, the list is not consecutive
            return False
    
    # Step 4: If all elements are consecutive, return True
    return True
```

This function sorts the list and checks for consecutive numbers by ensuring each number is followed by its successor. If any number is not followed by its successor, it returns `False`. If all numbers are consecutive, it returns `True`.

    # 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution

    This game is played on a $4 \times 4$ board. On this board there are $15$ playing tiles numbered from 1 to 15. One cell is left empty (denoted by 0). You need to get the board to the position presented below by repeatedly moving one of the tiles to the free space:

    $$\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\ 13 & 14 & 15 & 0 \end{matrix}$$

    The game "15 Puzzle‚Äù was created by Noyes Chapman in 1880.

    ## Existence Of The Solution

    Let's consider this problem: given a position on the board, determine whether a sequence of moves which leads to a solution exists.

    Suppose we have some position on the board:

    $$\begin{matrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \\ a_5 & a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \\ a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} \end{matrix}$$

    where one of the elements equals zero and indicates an empty cell $a_z  = 0$

    Let‚Äôs consider the permutation:

    $$a_1 a_2 ... a_{z-1} a_{z+1} ... a_{15} a_{16}$$

    i.e. the permutation of numbers corresponding to the position on the board without a zero element

    Let $N$ be the number of inversions in this permutation (i.e. the number of such elements $a_i$  and $a_j$  that $i < j$, but $a_i  > a_j$).

    Suppose $K$ is an index of a row where the empty element is located (i.e. using our convention, $K = (z - 1) \div \ 4 + 1$).

    Then, **the solution exists iff $N + K$ is even**.

    ## Implementation

    The algorithm above can be illustrated with the following program code:

    ```cpp
    int a[16];
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        cin >> a[i];

    int inv = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        if (a[i])
            for (int j=0; j<i; ++j)
                if (a[j] > a[i])
                    ++inv;
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        if (a[i] == 0)
            inv += 1 + i / 4;

    puts ((inv & 1) ? "No Solution" : "Solution Exists");
    ```

    ## Proof

    In 1879 Johnson proved that if $N + K$ is odd, then the solution doesn‚Äôt exist, and in the same year Story proved that all positions when $N + K$ is even have a solution.

    However, all these proofs were quite complex.

    In 1999 Archer proposed a much simpler proof (you can download his article [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf)).

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/472 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine if a given list of numbers contains consecutive numbers. Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order, without any gaps. For example, the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` contains consecutive numbers, but `[1, 3, 4, 5]` does not.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To check if a list contains consecutive numbers, we can follow these steps:
   - First, sort the list to arrange the numbers in ascending order.
   - Then, iterate through the sorted list and check if each number is exactly one more than the previous number.
   - If we find any number that is not one more than the previous number, the list does not contain consecutive numbers.
   - If we reach the end of the list without finding any gaps, the list contains consecutive numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function check_Consecutive(numbers):
       sort the list 'numbers'
       for each index i from 0 to length of numbers - 2:
           if numbers[i] + 1 is not equal to numbers[i + 1]:

       return True
   ```

            # If not, the numbers are not consecutive
