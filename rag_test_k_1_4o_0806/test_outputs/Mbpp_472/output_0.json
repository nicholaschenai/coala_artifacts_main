    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine if a given list of numbers contains consecutive numbers. Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order, without any gaps. For example, the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` contains consecutive numbers, but `[1, 3, 4, 5]` does not.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To check if a list contains consecutive numbers, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, sort the list to arrange the numbers in ascending order.\n   - Then, iterate through the sorted list and check if each number is exactly one more than the previous number.\n   - If we find any number that is not one more than the previous number, the list does not contain consecutive numbers.\n   - If we reach the end of the list without finding any gaps, the list contains consecutive numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function check_Consecutive(numbers):\n       sort the list 'numbers'\n       for each index i from 0 to length of numbers - 2:\n           if numbers[i] + 1 is not equal to numbers[i + 1]:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(numbers):\n    # Sort the list to ensure numbers are in ascending order\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Iterate through the sorted list\n    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):\n        # Check if the current number is followed by the next consecutive number\n        if numbers[i] + 1 != numbers[i + 1]:\n            # If not, the numbers are not consecutive\n            return False\n    \n    # If all numbers are consecutive, return True\n    return True\n```",
