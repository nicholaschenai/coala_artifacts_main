INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/281 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if all elements in a given list are unique. If all elements are unique, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

To determine if all elements in a list are unique, we can use the properties of a set. A set is a collection that automatically removes duplicate elements. Therefore, if we convert the list to a set and the length of the set is the same as the length of the list, then all elements in the list are unique. If the lengths differ, it means there were duplicates in the list.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `all_unique` that takes a list `lst` as an argument.
2. Convert the list `lst` to a set, which will remove any duplicate elements.
3. Compare the length of the set with the length of the list.
4. If the lengths are equal, return `True` (indicating all elements are unique).
5. If the lengths are not equal, return `False` (indicating there are duplicates).

### Final Python Solution

```python
def all_unique(lst):
    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_elements = set(lst)
    
    # Compare the length of the set with the length of the list
    # If they are equal, all elements were unique
    return len(unique_elements) == len(lst)
```

This solution efficiently checks for uniqueness by leveraging the properties of a set, ensuring that the function runs in linear time relative to the size of the list.
