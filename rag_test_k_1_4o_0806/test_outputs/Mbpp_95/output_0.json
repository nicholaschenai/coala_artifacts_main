    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the smallest list within that list of lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate over each list in the list of lists and determine its length. We will keep track of the smallest length encountered during this iteration. Finally, we will return this smallest length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function Find_Min_Length that takes a list of lists as input.\n   Initialize a variable min_length to a very large number (infinity).\n   For each list in the list of lists:\n       Calculate the length of the current list.\n       If this length is smaller than min_length, update min_length with this length.\n   Return min_length.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize min_length to a very large number\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        # Calculate the length of the current list\n        current_length = len(lst)\n        \n        # If the current length is smaller than min_length, update min_length\n        if current_length < min_length:\n            min_length = current_length\n    \n    # Return the smallest length found\n    return min_length\n```",
