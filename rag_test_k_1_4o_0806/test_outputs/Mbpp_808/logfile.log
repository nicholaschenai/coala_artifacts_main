INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/808 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that checks if a given integer `k` is present in a tuple of integers. The function should return `True` if `k` is found in the tuple, and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will define a function that takes two parameters: a tuple of integers and an integer `k`.
   - We will use the `in` keyword in Python to check if `k` is present in the tuple.
   - If `k` is found in the tuple, the function will return `True`.
   - If `k` is not found in the tuple, the function will return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function check_K with parameters (tuple_of_integers, k)
       If k is in tuple_of_integers
           Return True
       Else
           Return False
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_K(tuple_of_integers, k):
    # Check if k is present in the tuple_of_integers
    if k in tuple_of_integers:
        # If k is found, return True
        return True
    else:
        # If k is not found, return False
        return False
```

This function uses the `in` keyword to determine if `k` is an element of the tuple, which is a straightforward and efficient way to perform this check in Python.

    # 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution

    This game is played on a $4 \times 4$ board. On this board there are $15$ playing tiles numbered from 1 to 15. One cell is left empty (denoted by 0). You need to get the board to the position presented below by repeatedly moving one of the tiles to the free space:

    $$\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\ 13 & 14 & 15 & 0 \end{matrix}$$

    The game "15 Puzzle‚Äù was created by Noyes Chapman in 1880.

    ## Existence Of The Solution

    Let's consider this problem: given a position on the board, determine whether a sequence of moves which leads to a solution exists.

    Suppose we have some position on the board:

    $$\begin{matrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \\ a_5 & a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \\ a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} \end{matrix}$$

    where one of the elements equals zero and indicates an empty cell $a_z  = 0$

    Let‚Äôs consider the permutation:

    $$a_1 a_2 ... a_{z-1} a_{z+1} ... a_{15} a_{16}$$

    i.e. the permutation of numbers corresponding to the position on the board without a zero element

    Let $N$ be the number of inversions in this permutation (i.e. the number of such elements $a_i$  and $a_j$  that $i < j$, but $a_i  > a_j$).

    Suppose $K$ is an index of a row where the empty element is located (i.e. using our convention, $K = (z - 1) \div \ 4 + 1$).

    Then, **the solution exists iff $N + K$ is even**.

    ## Implementation

    The algorithm above can be illustrated with the following program code:

    ```cpp
    int a[16];
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        cin >> a[i];

    int inv = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        if (a[i])
            for (int j=0; j<i; ++j)
                if (a[j] > a[i])
                    ++inv;
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        if (a[i] == 0)
            inv += 1 + i / 4;

    puts ((inv & 1) ? "No Solution" : "Solution Exists");
    ```

    ## Proof

    In 1879 Johnson proved that if $N + K$ is odd, then the solution doesn‚Äôt exist, and in the same year Story proved that all positions when $N + K$ is even have a solution.

    However, all these proofs were quite complex.

    In 1999 Archer proposed a much simpler proof (you can download his article [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf)).
