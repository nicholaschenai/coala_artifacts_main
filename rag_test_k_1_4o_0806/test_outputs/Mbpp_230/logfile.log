INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/230 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a string and a character as inputs. The function should replace all blank spaces in the string with the given character and return the modified string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We can solve this problem by iterating over the string and checking each character. If a character is a blank space, we replace it with the specified character. We can use Python's built-in string method `replace` to achieve this efficiently.

3. **Pseudocode Solution:**
   - Define a function `replace_blank` that takes two parameters: `input_string` and `replacement_char`.
   - Use the `replace` method of the string to replace all occurrences of the space character `' '` with `replacement_char`.
   - Return the modified string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def replace_blank(input_string: str, replacement_char: str) -> str:
    # Use the replace method to replace all spaces with the replacement character
    modified_string = input_string.replace(' ', replacement_char)
    # Return the modified string
    return modified_string
```

This solution uses the `replace` method, which is a straightforward and efficient way to replace all occurrences of a specified substring (in this case, a space) with another substring (the replacement character).

    Chapter: Introduction
    Section: Input and output
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Input and output}

    \index{input and output}

    In most contests, standard streams are used for
    reading input and writing output.
    In C++, the standard streams are
    \texttt{cin} for input and \texttt{cout} for output.
    In addition, the C functions
    \texttt{scanf} and \texttt{printf} can be used.

    The input for the program usually consists of
    numbers and strings that are separated with
    spaces and newlines.
    They can be read from the \texttt{cin} stream
    as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a, b;
    string x;
    cin >> a >> b >> x;
    \end{lstlisting}

    This kind of code always works,
    assuming that there is at least one space
    or newline between each element in the input.
    For example, the above code can read
    both of the following inputs:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    123 456 monkey
    \end{lstlisting}
    \begin{lstlisting}
    123    456
    monkey
    \end{lstlisting}
    The \texttt{cout} stream is used for output
    as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a = 123, b = 456;
    string x = "monkey";
    cout << a << " " << b << " " << x << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    Input and output is sometimes
    a bottleneck in the program.
    The following lines at the beginning of the code
    make input and output more efficient:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that the newline \texttt{"\textbackslash n"}
    works faster than \texttt{endl},
    because \texttt{endl} always causes
    a flush operation.

    The C functions \texttt{scanf}
    and \texttt{printf} are an alternative
    to the C++ standard streams.
    They are usually a bit faster,
    but they are also more difficult to use.
    The following code reads two integers from the input:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    \end{lstlisting}
    The following code prints two integers:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a = 123, b = 456;
    printf("%d %d\n", a, b);
    \end{lstlisting}

    Sometimes the program should read a whole line
    from the input, possibly containing spaces.
    This can be accomplished by using the
    \texttt{getline} function:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    string s;
    getline(cin, s);
    \end{lstlisting}

    If the amount of data is unknown, the following
    loop is useful:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    while (cin >> x) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    This loop reads elements from the input
    one after another, until there is no
    more data available in the input.

    In some contest systems, files are used for
    input and output.
    An easy solution for this is to write
    the code as usual using standard streams,
    but add the following lines to the beginning of the code:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this, the program reads the input from the file
    ''input.txt'' and writes the output to the file
    ''output.txt''.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/230 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a string and a character as inputs. The function should replace all spaces in the string with the given character and return the modified string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate over each character in the input string. If a character is a space, we replace it with the specified character. If it's not a space, we keep the character as it is. We then join all these characters back into a single string and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function replace_blank with parameters input_string and replacement_char
       Initialize an empty list to store characters
       For each character in input_string
           If the character is a space
               Append replacement_char to the list
           Else
               Append the character to the list
       Join the list into a single string
       Return the resulting string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def replace_blank(input_string: str, replacement_char: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the characters of the new string
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # If the character is a space, append the replacement character
        if char == ' ':
            result.append(replacement_char)
        else:

            result.append(char)
    
    # Join the list of characters into a single string

```

This function will replace all spaces in the input string with the specified character and return the modified string.
