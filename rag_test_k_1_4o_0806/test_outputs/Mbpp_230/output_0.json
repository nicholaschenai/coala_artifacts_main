    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a string and a character as inputs. The function should replace all spaces in the string with the given character and return the modified string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate over each character in the input string. If a character is a space, we replace it with the specified character. If it's not a space, we keep the character as it is. We then join all these characters back into a single string and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function replace_blank with parameters input_string and replacement_char\n       Initialize an empty list to store characters\n       For each character in input_string\n           If the character is a space\n               Append replacement_char to the list\n           Else\n               Append the character to the list\n       Join the list into a single string\n       Return the resulting string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef replace_blank(input_string: str, replacement_char: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the characters of the new string\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # If the character is a space, append the replacement character\n        if char == ' ':\n            result.append(replacement_char)\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, append the original character\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list of characters into a single string\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\nThis function will replace all spaces in the input string with the specified character and return the modified string.",
