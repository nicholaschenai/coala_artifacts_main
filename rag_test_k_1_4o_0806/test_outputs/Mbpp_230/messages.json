The function should replace all blank spaces in the string with the given character and return the modified string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We can solve this problem by iterating over the string and checking each character. If a character is a blank space, we replace it with the specified character. We can use Python's built-in string method `replace` to achieve this efficiently.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution:**\n   - Define a function `replace_blank` that takes two parameters: `input_string` and `replacement_char`.\n   - Use the `replace` method of the string to replace all occurrences of the space character `' '` with `replacement_char`.\n   - Return the modified string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef replace_blank(input_string: str, replacement_char: str) -> str:\n    # Use the replace method to replace all spaces with the replacement character\n    modified_string = input_string.replace(' ', replacement_char)\n    # Return the modified string\n    return modified_string\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `replace` method, which is a straightforward and efficient way to replace all occurrences of a specified substring (in this case, a space) with another substring (the replacement character)."
