    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that calculates the sum and average of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should return a tuple containing these two values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. This can be done using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \\( \\text{sum} = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\).\n   - Next, we calculate the average by dividing the sum by `n`.\n   - Finally, we return a tuple containing the sum and the average.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function sum_average(n):\n       Calculate sum using formula: sum = n * (n + 1) / 2\n       Calculate average: average = sum / n\n       Return tuple (sum, average)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_average(n: int) -> tuple:\n    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula\n    total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    \n    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by n\n    average = total_sum / n\n    \n    # Return the sum and average as a tuple\n    return (total_sum, average)\n```",
