### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum and average of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should return a tuple containing the sum and the average.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Sum of First n Natural Numbers**: The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the arithmetic series sum formula.

2. **Average of First n Natural Numbers**: Once we have the sum, the average can be calculated by dividing the sum by `n`.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return a tuple containing the sum and the average.

### Pseudocode

```
function sum_average(n):
    sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
    average = sum / n
    return (sum, average)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_average(n: int) -> tuple:
    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula
    sum_n = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
    
    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by n
    average_n = sum_n / n
    
    # Return the sum and average as a tuple
    return (sum_n, average_n)
```

This solution efficiently calculates the sum and average using mathematical formulas, ensuring that the function runs in constant time, O(1). The use of integer division `//` ensures that the sum is an integer, which is appropriate since the sum of natural numbers is always an integer. The average is calculated as a float, which is suitable for the division operation.
