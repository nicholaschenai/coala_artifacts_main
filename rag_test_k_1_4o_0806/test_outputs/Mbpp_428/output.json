    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to implement a sorting algorithm called Shell Sort to sort a given list of numbers in ascending order. The function should be named `shell_sort` and should return the sorted list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Shell Sort is an optimization over Insertion Sort. It works by comparing elements that are a certain gap apart and sorting them. The gap is reduced gradually until it becomes 1, at which point the list is sorted using a final pass of Insertion Sort. The idea is to allow the exchange of far apart elements to reduce the number of inversions, leading to a more efficient sorting process.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function shell_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       gap = n // 2\n       while gap > 0:\n           for i from gap to n-1:\n               temp = arr[i]\n               j = i\n               while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                   arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                   j = j - gap\n               arr[j] = temp\n           gap = gap // 2\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef shell_sort(arr):\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Initialize the gap size\n    gap = n // 2\n    \n    # Continue the process until the gap is reduced to 0\n    while gap > 0:\n        # Perform a gapped insertion sort for this gap size\n        for i in range(gap, n):\n            # Store the current element in a temporary variable\n            temp = arr[i]\n            # Initialize j to the current index\n            j = i\n            # Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found\n            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                j -= gap\n            # Place the temp element at its correct position\n            arr[j] = temp\n        # Reduce the gap for the next iteration\n        gap //= 2\n    \n    # Return the sorted array\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the Shell Sort algorithm, which sorts the input list by progressively reducing the gap between compared elements and performing a gapped insertion sort. The process continues until the gap is reduced to zero, at which point the list is fully sorted.",
