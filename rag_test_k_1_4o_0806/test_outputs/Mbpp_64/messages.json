The function should return a new list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the second element (the mark) of each tuple.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities to sort the list of tuples.\n2. The `sorted()` function can be used to sort the list, and we can specify a custom sorting key.\n3. The custom key will be a function that extracts the second element of each tuple, which is the mark.\n4. The `sorted()` function will then sort the tuples based on these extracted marks.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `subject_marks` that takes a list of tuples `marks_list` as input.\n2. Use the `sorted()` function to sort `marks_list`.\n   - Use a lambda function as the key to extract the second element of each tuple.\n3. Return the sorted list.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef subject_marks(marks_list):\n    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple\n    sorted_list = sorted(marks_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    return sorted_list\n```\n\nThis function will take a list of tuples, sort them by the second element of each tuple (the mark), and return the sorted list."
