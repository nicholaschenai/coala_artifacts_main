    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a 32-bit integer and rotates its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. The function should return the resulting integer after the rotation.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To rotate the bits of a 32-bit integer to the left by `d` positions:\n   - Shift the bits of the number to the left by `d` positions.\n   - Capture the bits that overflow beyond the 32-bit boundary and wrap them around to the right side of the number.\n   - Combine these two results using a bitwise OR operation to get the final rotated number.\n   - Since the number is 32-bit, use a mask to ensure that only the lower 32 bits are considered.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function left_rotate(n, d):\n       # Shift the number n to the left by d positions\n       left_shifted = n << d\n       \n       # Shift the number n to the right by (32 - d) positions to capture overflow bits\n       right_shifted = n >> (32 - d)\n       \n       # Combine the left and right shifted results using bitwise OR\n       result = (left_shifted | right_shifted) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n       \n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef left_rotate(n: int, d: int) -> int:\n    # Shift the number n to the left by d positions\n    left_shifted = n << d\n    \n    # Shift the number n to the right by (32 - d) positions to capture overflow bits\n    right_shifted = n >> (32 - d)\n    \n    # Combine the left and right shifted results using bitwise OR\n    # Use a mask to ensure the result is within 32 bits\n    result = (left_shifted | right_shifted) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly rotate the bits of a 32-bit integer to the left by `d` positions and return the resulting integer.",
