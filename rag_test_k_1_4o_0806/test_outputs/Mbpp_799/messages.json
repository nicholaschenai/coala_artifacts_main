        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a 32-bit integer and rotates its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. The function should return the resulting integer after the rotation.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Bit Rotation**: Rotating bits to the left by `d` positions means that each bit in the number is shifted `d` positions to the left. The bits that overflow on the left are wrapped around to the right end of the number.\n\n2. **32-bit Constraint**: Since the number is 32-bit, we need to ensure that the rotation respects this bit width. This means that after shifting, any bits that go beyond the 32nd position should wrap around to the beginning.\n\n3. **Steps to Rotate**:\n   - Shift the number to the left by `d` positions.\n   - Capture the bits that overflow beyond the 32nd bit.\n   - Shift these overflow bits to the right end of the number.\n   - Combine the two results using a bitwise OR operation.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since rotating by 32 or more positions results in the same number, we can use `d % 32` to simplify the rotation.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Calculate `d = d % 32` to handle cases where `d` is 32 or more.\n2. Perform a left shift on the number by `d` positions.\n3. Capture the overflow bits by right shifting the number by `(32 - d)` positions.\n4. Combine the results using a bitwise OR to get the final rotated number.\n5. Return the result.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef left_rotate(n: int, d: int) -> int:\n    # Step 1: Normalize d to be within 0 to 31\n    d = d % 32\n    \n    # Step 2: Perform the left rotation\n    # Left shift the number by d positions\n    left_shifted = n << d\n    \n    # Step 3: Capture the overflow bits\n    # Right shift the number by (32 - d) positions\n    overflow_bits = n >> (32 - d)\n    \n    # Step 4: Combine the left shifted and overflow bits using bitwise OR\n    result = (left_shifted | overflow_bits) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n    \n    # Step 5: Return the result\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code will correctly rotate the bits of a 32-bit integer to the left by `d` positions, wrapping any overflow bits around to the right end. The use of `0xFFFFFFFF` ensures that the result is constrained to 32 bits."

GCC defines a list at [Built-in Functions Provided by GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html) that also work in older versions of C++:\n\n    - `__builtin_popcount(unsigned int)` returns the number of set bits (`__builtin_popcount(0b0001'0010'1100) == 4`)\n    - `__builtin_ffs(int)` finds the index of the first (most right) set bit (`__builtin_ffs(0b0001'0010'1100) == 3`)\n    - `__builtin_clz(unsigned int)` the count of leading zeros (`__builtin_clz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 23`)\n    - `__builtin_ctz(unsigned int)` the count of trailing zeros (`__builtin_ctz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 2`)\n\n    _Note that some of the operations (both the C++20 functions and the Compiler Built-in ones) might be quite slow in GCC if you don't enable a specific compiler target with `#pragma GCC target(\"popcnt\")`._\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
