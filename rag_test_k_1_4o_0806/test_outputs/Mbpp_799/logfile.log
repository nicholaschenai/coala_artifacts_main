INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/799 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a 32-bit integer and rotates its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. The function should return the resulting integer after the rotation.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand Bit Rotation**: Rotating bits to the left by `d` positions means that each bit in the number is shifted `d` positions to the left. The bits that overflow on the left are wrapped around to the right end of the number.

2. **32-bit Constraint**: Since the number is 32-bit, we need to ensure that the rotation respects this bit width. This means that after shifting, any bits that go beyond the 32nd position should wrap around to the beginning.

3. **Steps to Rotate**:
   - Shift the number to the left by `d` positions.
   - Capture the bits that overflow beyond the 32nd bit.
   - Shift these overflow bits to the right end of the number.
   - Combine the two results using a bitwise OR operation.

4. **Modulo Operation**: Since rotating by 32 or more positions results in the same number, we can use `d % 32` to simplify the rotation.

### Pseudocode

1. Calculate `d = d % 32` to handle cases where `d` is 32 or more.
2. Perform a left shift on the number by `d` positions.
3. Capture the overflow bits by right shifting the number by `(32 - d)` positions.
4. Combine the results using a bitwise OR to get the final rotated number.
5. Return the result.

### Python Code

```python
def left_rotate(n: int, d: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Normalize d to be within 0 to 31
    d = d % 32
    
    # Step 2: Perform the left rotation
    # Left shift the number by d positions
    left_shifted = n << d
    
    # Step 3: Capture the overflow bits
    # Right shift the number by (32 - d) positions
    overflow_bits = n >> (32 - d)
    
    # Step 4: Combine the left shifted and overflow bits using bitwise OR
    result = (left_shifted | overflow_bits) & 0xFFFFFFFF
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return result
```

This code will correctly rotate the bits of a 32-bit integer to the left by `d` positions, wrapping any overflow bits around to the right end. The use of `0xFFFFFFFF` ensures that the result is constrained to 32 bits.

    ### Language and compiler support

    C++ supports some of those operations since C++20 via the [bit](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/bit) standard library:

    - `has_single_bit`: checks if the number is a power of two
    - `bit_ceil` / `bit_floor`: round up/down to the next power of two
    - `rotl` / `rotr`: rotate the bits in the number
    - `countl_zero` / `countr_zero` / `countl_one` / `countr_one`: count the leading/trailing zeros/ones
    - `popcount`: count the number of set bits

    Additionally, there are also predefined functions in some compilers that help working with bits.
    E.g. GCC defines a list at [Built-in Functions Provided by GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html) that also work in older versions of C++:

    - `__builtin_popcount(unsigned int)` returns the number of set bits (`__builtin_popcount(0b0001'0010'1100) == 4`)
    - `__builtin_ffs(int)` finds the index of the first (most right) set bit (`__builtin_ffs(0b0001'0010'1100) == 3`)
    - `__builtin_clz(unsigned int)` the count of leading zeros (`__builtin_clz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 23`)
    - `__builtin_ctz(unsigned int)` the count of trailing zeros (`__builtin_ctz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 2`)

    _Note that some of the operations (both the C++20 functions and the Compiler Built-in ones) might be quite slow in GCC if you don't enable a specific compiler target with `#pragma GCC target("popcnt")`._

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/799 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a 32-bit integer and rotates its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. The function should return the resulting integer after the rotation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To rotate the bits of a 32-bit integer to the left by `d` positions:
   - Shift the bits of the number to the left by `d` positions.
   - Capture the bits that overflow beyond the 32-bit boundary and wrap them around to the right side of the number.
   - Combine these two results using a bitwise OR operation to get the final rotated number.
   - Since the number is 32-bit, use a mask to ensure that only the lower 32 bits are considered.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function left_rotate(n, d):
       # Shift the number n to the left by d positions
       left_shifted = n << d
       
       # Shift the number n to the right by (32 - d) positions to capture overflow bits
       right_shifted = n >> (32 - d)
       
       # Combine the left and right shifted results using bitwise OR
       result = (left_shifted | right_shifted) & 0xFFFFFFFF
       
       return result
   ```
