INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/596 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function named `tuple_size` that takes a tuple as input and returns the size of that tuple in bytes. The size should be determined using Python's built-in method for measuring the size of an object in memory.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Python provides a built-in function `sys.getsizeof()` that returns the size of an object in bytes. This function includes the overhead of the object itself.
   - We will use this function to determine the size of the input tuple.
   - The function `tuple_size` will take a tuple as an argument and return the result of `sys.getsizeof()` applied to that tuple.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   - Import the `sys` module to access the `getsizeof` function.
   - Define the function `tuple_size` that takes a single parameter `tup`.
   - Inside the function, use `sys.getsizeof(tup)` to get the size of the tuple.
   - Return the size obtained from `sys.getsizeof(tup)`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
import sys

# Define the function tuple_size
def tuple_size(tup: tuple) -> int:
    # Use sys.getsizeof to get the size of the tuple in bytes
    return sys.getsizeof(tup)
```

This solution imports the `sys` module and defines the `tuple_size` function, which returns the size of the input tuple in bytes using `sys.getsizeof()`.

    Chapter: Introduction
    Section: Shortening code
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Shortening code}

    Short code is ideal in competitive programming,
    because programs should be written
    as fast as possible.
    Because of this, competitive programmers often define
    shorter names for datatypes and other parts of code.

    \subsubsection{Type names}
    \index{tuppdef@\texttt{typedef}}
    Using the command \texttt{typedef}
    it is possible to give a shorter name
    to a datatype.
    For example, the name \texttt{long long} is long,
    so we can define a shorter name \texttt{ll}:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    typedef long long ll;
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this, the code
    \begin{lstlisting}
    long long a = 123456789;
    long long b = 987654321;
    cout << a*b << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}
    can be shortened as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    ll a = 123456789;
    ll b = 987654321;
    cout << a*b << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The command \texttt{typedef}
    can also be used with more complex types.
    For example, the following code gives
    the name \texttt{vi} for a vector of integers
    and the name \texttt{pi} for a pair
    that contains two integers.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    typedef vector<int> vi;
    typedef pair<int,int> pi;
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Macros}
    \index{macro}
    Another way to shorten code is to define
    \key{macros}.
    A macro means that certain strings in
    the code will be changed before the compilation.
    In C++, macros are defined using the
    \texttt{\#define} keyword.

    For example, we can define the following macros:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    #define F first
    #define S second
    #define PB push_back
    #define MP make_pair
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this, the code
    \begin{lstlisting}
    v.push_back(make_pair(y1,x1));
    v.push_back(make_pair(y2,x2));
    int d = v[i].first+v[i].second;
    \end{lstlisting}
    can be shortened as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    v.PB(MP(y1,x1));
    v.PB(MP(y2,x2));
    int d = v[i].F+v[i].S;
    \end{lstlisting}

    A macro can also have parameters
    which makes it possible to shorten loops and other
    structures.
    For example, we can define the following macro:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    #define REP(i,a,b) for (int i = a; i <= b; i++)
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this, the code
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        search(i);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    can be shortened as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    REP(i,1,n) {
        search(i);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Sometimes macros cause bugs that may be difficult
    to detect. For example, consider the following macro
    that calculates the square of a number:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    #define SQ(a) a*a
    \end{lstlisting}
    This macro \emph{does not} always work as expected.
    For example, the code
    \begin{lstlisting}
    cout << SQ(3+3) << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}
    corresponds to the code
    \begin{lstlisting}
    cout << 3+3*3+3 << "\n"; // 15
    \end{lstlisting}

    A better version of the macro is as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    #define SQ(a) (a)*(a)
    \end{lstlisting}
    Now the code
    \begin{lstlisting}
    cout << SQ(3+3) << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}
    corresponds to the code
    \begin{lstlisting}
    cout << (3+3)*(3+3) << "\n"; // 36
    \end{lstlisting}
