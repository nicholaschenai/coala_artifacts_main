        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes an IP address as a string input and removes any leading zeros from each of its segments. An IP address is typically represented in the format \"x.x.x.x\", where each \"x\" is a number between 0 and 255. The task is to ensure that each segment of the IP address does not have any leading zeros.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Split the IP address string into its four segments using the period ('.') as a delimiter.\n   - For each segment, convert it to an integer to automatically remove any leading zeros.\n   - Convert each integer back to a string.\n   - Join the segments back together with periods to form the corrected IP address.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function removezero_ip(ip_address):\n       split the ip_address by '.'\n       for each segment in the split result:\n           convert the segment to an integer (this removes leading zeros)\n           convert the integer back to a string\n       join the segments with '.' to form the new IP address\n       return the new IP address\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip_address: str) -> str:\n    # Split the IP address into its segments\n    segments = ip_address.split('.')\n    \n    # Process each segment to remove leading zeros\n    processed_segments = []\n    for segment in segments:\n        # Convert to integer to remove leading zeros, then back to string\n        processed_segment = str(int(segment))\n        processed_segments.append(processed_segment)\n    \n    # Join the processed segments back into a single IP address string\n    return '.'.join(processed_segments)\n```\n\nThis solution effectively removes leading zeros from each segment of the IP address by leveraging the conversion to an integer, which inherently strips any leading zeros. The segments are then reassembled into a valid IP address format."
