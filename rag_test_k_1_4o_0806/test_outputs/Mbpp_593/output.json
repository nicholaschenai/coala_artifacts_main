    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes an IP address as a string input and removes any leading zeros from each of its segments. An IP address is typically represented as four numbers separated by dots, and each number can have leading zeros that should be removed.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Split the input IP address string into its four segments using the dot (.) as a delimiter.\n   - For each segment, convert it to an integer to automatically remove any leading zeros.\n   - Convert each integer back to a string.\n   - Join the segments back together with dots to form the cleaned IP address.\n   - Return the cleaned IP address.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function removezero_ip(ip_address):\n       split the ip_address by '.' to get a list of segments\n       for each segment in the list:\n           convert the segment to an integer to remove leading zeros\n           convert the integer back to a string\n       join the list of segments with '.' to form the cleaned IP address\n       return the cleaned IP address\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip_address: str) -> str:\n    # Split the IP address into segments using '.' as the delimiter\n    segments = ip_address.split('.')\n    \n    # Process each segment to remove leading zeros\n    cleaned_segments = []\n    for segment in segments:\n        # Convert the segment to an integer to remove leading zeros\n        # Then convert it back to a string\n        cleaned_segment = str(int(segment))\n        cleaned_segments.append(cleaned_segment)\n    \n    # Join the cleaned segments with '.' to form the cleaned IP address\n    cleaned_ip_address = '.'.join(cleaned_segments)\n    \n    # Return the cleaned IP address\n    return cleaned_ip_address\n```",
