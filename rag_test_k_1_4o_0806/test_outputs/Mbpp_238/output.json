    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts the number of non-empty substrings in a given string. A substring is any sequence of characters that appears consecutively within the string. For example, for the string \"abc\", the substrings are \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"ab\", \"bc\", and \"abc\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the number of non-empty substrings of a string, we can use the following approach:\n   - For a string of length `n`, each character can be the start of a substring.\n   - For each starting character, the substring can end at any position from the start to the end of the string.\n   - Therefore, for a string of length `n`, the number of substrings is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function number_of_substrings(s):\n       n = length of s\n       return n * (n + 1) / 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(s: str) -> int:\n    # Calculate the length of the string\n    n = len(s)\n    # Use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers to find the number of substrings\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function calculates the number of non-empty substrings by using the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which efficiently gives us the count of all possible substrings in the string.",
