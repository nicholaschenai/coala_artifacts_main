INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/773 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that finds the first occurrence of a given substring within a larger string. The function should return a tuple containing the substring, the starting index of the substring, and the ending index of the substring. If the substring is not found, the function should return `None`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Substring**: Use Python's string method to find the first occurrence of the substring within the main string.
2. **Determine Indices**: If the substring is found, calculate the starting and ending indices of the substring.
3. **Return Result**: Return a tuple with the substring and its indices. If the substring is not found, return `None`.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `occurance_substring` that takes two parameters: `main_string` and `substring`.
2. Use the `find` method of the string to get the starting index of the `substring` in `main_string`.
3. If the starting index is `-1`, return `None` (indicating the substring is not found).
4. Otherwise, calculate the ending index as the starting index plus the length of the substring.
5. Return a tuple containing the substring, the starting index, and the ending index.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def occurance_substring(main_string: str, substring: str):
    # Find the starting index of the substring in the main string
    start_index = main_string.find(substring)
    
    # If the substring is not found, return None
    if start_index == -1:
        return None
    
    # Calculate the ending index of the substring
    end_index = start_index + len(substring)
    
    # Return the tuple with the substring and its indices
    return (substring, start_index, end_index)
```

This solution uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is found, it calculates the ending index by adding the length of the substring to the starting index. The function then returns the required tuple. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

    Part: 1/2
    # Finding repetitions

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.

    A **repetition** is two occurrences of a string in a row.
    In other words a repetition can be described by a pair of indices $i < j$ such that the substring $s[i \dots j]$ consists of two identical strings written after each other.

    The challenge is to **find all repetitions** in a given string $s$.
    Or a simplified task: find **any** repetition or find the **longest** repetition.

    The algorithm described here was published in 1982 by Main and Lorentz.

    ## Example

    Consider the repetitions in the following example string:

    $$acababaee$$

    The string contains the following three repetitions:

    - $s[2 \dots 5] = abab$
    - $s[3 \dots 6] = baba$
    - $s[7 \dots 7] = ee$

    Another example:

    $$abaaba$$

    Here there are only two repetitions

    - $s[0 \dots 5] = abaaba$
    - $s[2 \dots 3] = aa$

    ## Number of repetitions

    In general there can be up to $O(n^2)$ repetitions in a string of length $n$.
    An obvious example is a string consisting of $n$ times the same letter, in this case any substring of even length is a repetition.
    In general any periodic string with a short period will contain a lot of repetitions.

    On the other hand this fact does not prevent computing the number of repetitions in $O(n \log n)$ time, because the algorithm can give the repetitions in compressed form, in groups of several pieces at once.

    There is even the concept, that describes groups of periodic substrings with tuples of size four.
    It has been proven that we the number of such groups is at most linear with respect to the string length.

    Also, here are some more interesting results related to the number of repetitions:

      - The number of primitive repetitions (those whose halves are not repetitions) is at most $O(n \log n)$.
      - If we encode repetitions with tuples of numbers (called Crochemore triples) $(i,~ p,~ r)$ (where $i$ is the position of the beginning, $p$ the length of the repeating substring, and $r$ the number of repetitions), then all repetitions can be described with $O(n \log n)$ such triples.
      - Fibonacci strings, defined as 
    
        \[\begin{align}
        t_0 &= a, \\\\
        t_1 &= b, \\\\
        t_i &= t_{i-1} + t_{i-2},
        \end{align}\]
    
        are "strongly" periodic.
        The number of repetitions in the Fibonacci string $f_i$, even in the compressed with Crochemore triples, is $O(f_n \log f_n)$.
        The number of primitive repetitions is also $O(f_n \log f_n)$.

    ## Main-Lorentz algorithm

    The idea behind the Main-Lorentz algorithm is **divide-and-conquer**.

    It splits the initial string into halves, and computes the number of repetitions that lie completely in each halve by two recursive calls.
    Then comes the difficult part.
    The algorithm finds all repetitions starting in the first half and ending in the second half (which we will call **crossing repetitions**).
    This is the essential part of the Main-Lorentz algorithm, and we will discuss it in detail here.

    The complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms is well researched.
    The [master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)) says, that we will end up with an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm, if we can compute the crossing repetitions in $O(n)$ time.

    ### Search for crossing repetitions

    So we want to find all such repetitions that start in the first half of the string, let's call it $u$, and end in the second half, let's call it $v$:

    $$s = u + v$$

    Their lengths are approximately equal to the length of $s$ divided by two.

    Consider an arbitrary repetition and look at the middle character (more precisely the first character of the second half of the repetition).
    I.e. if the repetition is a substring $s[i \dots j]$, then the middle character is $(i + j + 1) / 2$.

    We call a repetition **left** or **right** depending on which string this character is located - in the string $u$ or in the string $v$.
    In other words a string is called left, if the majority of it lies in $u$, otherwise we call it right.

    We will now discuss how to find **all left repetitions**.
    Finding all right repetitions can be done in the same way.

    Let us denote the length of the left repetition by $2l$ (i.e. each half of the repetition has length $l$).
    Consider the first character of the repetition falling into the string $v$ (it is at position $|u|$ in the string $s$).
    It coincides with the character $l$ positions before it, let's denote this position $cntr$.

    We will fixate this position $cntr$, and **look for all repetitions at this position** $cntr$.

    For example:

    $$c ~ \underset{cntr}{a} ~ c ~ | ~ a ~ d ~ a$$

    The vertical lines divides the two halves.
    Here we fixated the position $cntr = 1$, and at this position we find the repetition $caca$.

    It is clear, that if we fixate the position $cntr$, we simultaneously fixate the length of the possible repetitions: $l = |u| - cntr$.
    Once we know how to find these repetitions, we will iterate over all possible values for $cntr$ from $0$ to $|u|-1$, and find all left crossover repetitions of length $l = |u|,~ |u|-1,~ \dots, 1$.

    ### Criterion for left crossing repetitions

    Now, how can we find all such repetitions for a fixated $cntr$?
    Keep in mind that there still can be multiple such repetitions.

    Let's again look at a visualization, this time for the repetition $abcabc$:

    $$\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ \overbrace{\underset{cntr}{b} ~ c}^{l_2} ~ \overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ | ~ \overbrace{b ~ c}^{l_2}$$

    Here we denoted the lengths of the two pieces of the repetition with $l_1$ and $l_2$:
    $l_1$ is the length of the repetition up to the position $cntr-1$, and $l_2$ is the length of the repetition from $cntr$ to the end of the half of the repetition.
    We have $2l = l_1 + l_2 + l_1 + l_2$ as the total length of the repetition.

    Let us generate **necessary and sufficient** conditions for such a repetition at position $cntr$ of length $2l = 2(l_1 + l_2) = 2(|u| - cntr)$:

    - Let $k_1$ be the largest number such that the first $k_1$ characters before the position $cntr$ coincide with the last $k_1$ characters in the string $u$:
  
    $$
    u[cntr - k_1 \dots cntr - 1] = u[|u| - k_1 \dots |u| - 1]
    $$
  
    - Let $k_2$ be the largest number such that the $k_2$ characters starting at position $cntr$ coincide with the first $k_2$ characters in the string $v$:

    $$  
      u[cntr \dots cntr + k_2 - 1] = v[0 \dots k_2 - 1]
    $$
  
    - Then we have a repetition exactly for any pair $(l_1,~ l_2)$ with

    $$
      \begin{align}
      l_1 &\le k_1, \\\\
      l_2 &\le k_2. \\\\
      \end{align}
    $$

    To summarize:

    - We fixate a specific position $cntr$.
    - All repetition which we will find now have length $2l = 2(|u| - cntr)$.
      There might be multiple such repetitions, they depend on the lengths $l_1$ and $l_2 = l - l_1$.
    - We find $k_1$ and $k_2$ as described above.
    - Then all suitable repetitions are the ones for which the lengths of the pieces $l_1$ and $l_2$ satisfy the conditions:

    $$
      \begin{align}
      l_1 + l_2 &= l = |u| - cntr \\\\
      l_1 &\le k_1, \\\\
      l_2 &\le k_2. \\\\
      \end{align}
    $$

    Therefore the only remaining part is how we can compute the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ quickly for every position $cntr$.
    Luckily we can compute them in $O(1)$ using the [Z-function](../string/z-function.md):

    - To can find the value $k_1$ for each position by calculating the Z-function for the string $\overline{u}$ (i.e. the reversed string $u$).
      Then the value $k_1$ for a particular $cntr$ will be equal to the corresponding value of the array of the Z-function.
    - To precompute all values $k_2$, we calculate the Z-function for the string $v + \# + u$ (i.e. the string $u$ concatenated with the separator character $\#$ and the string $v$).
      Again we just need to look up the corresponding value in the Z-function to get the $k_2$ value.

    So this is enough to find all left crossing repetitions.

    ### Right crossing repetitions

    For computing the right crossing repetitions we act similarly:
    we define the center $cntr$ as the character corresponding to the last character in the string $u$.
