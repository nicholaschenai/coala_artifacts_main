    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts how many times elements from a given list appear in a given tuple. The function should return the total count of these occurrences.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each element in the list.\n   - For each element in the list, we will count how many times it appears in the tuple.\n   - We will keep a running total of these counts.\n   - Finally, we will return the total count.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function count_Occurrence with parameters (tuple_data, list_data)\n       Initialize total_count to 0\n       For each element in list_data\n           Count occurrences of the element in tuple_data\n           Add the count to total_count\n       Return total_count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_Occurrence(tuple_data: tuple, list_data: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of total occurrences\n    total_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in list_data:\n        # Count how many times the current element appears in the tuple\n        count = tuple_data.count(element)\n        \n        # Add the count to the total count\n        total_count += count\n    \n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return total_count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the occurrences of each element from the list in the tuple and return the total count.",
