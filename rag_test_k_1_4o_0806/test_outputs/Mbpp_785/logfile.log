INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/785 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a string representation of a tuple containing integers and converts it into an actual tuple of integers.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - The input is a string that looks like a tuple, for example, "(7, 8, 9)".
   - We need to remove the parentheses and split the string by commas to get individual string numbers.
   - Convert these string numbers into integers.
   - Finally, return these integers as a tuple.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   - Define a function `tuple_str_int` that takes a string `s`.
   - Remove the parentheses from the string `s`.
   - Split the resulting string by commas to get a list of string numbers.
   - Convert each string number in the list to an integer.
   - Return the integers as a tuple.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**

```python
def tuple_str_int(s: str) -> tuple:
    # Remove the parentheses from the string
    s = s.strip("()")
    
    # Split the string by commas to get a list of string numbers
    str_numbers = s.split(", ")
    
    # Convert each string number to an integer
    int_numbers = tuple(int(num) for num in str_numbers)
    
    # Return the tuple of integers
    return int_numbers
```

This function will take a string like "(7, 8, 9)", remove the parentheses, split the string by commas, convert each part to an integer, and return the result as a tuple of integers.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
