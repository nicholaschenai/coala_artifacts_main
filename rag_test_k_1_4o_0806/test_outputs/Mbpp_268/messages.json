A star number is a figurate number that represents a centered hexagram (a six-pointed star), like the Star of David. The nth star number can be calculated using a specific formula.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The formula to find the nth star number is given by: `Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1`. This formula calculates the number of points in a star shape for a given n. We will implement this formula in a function to compute the nth star number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `find_star_num` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n   - Use the formula `Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1` to calculate the nth star number.\n   - Return the result.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**\n\n```python\ndef find_star_num(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth star number using the formula\n    # Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n    star_number = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n    # Return the calculated star number\n    return star_number\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the nth star number using the given formula."
