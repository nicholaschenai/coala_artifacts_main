INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/268 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the nth star number. A star number is a figurate number that represents a centered hexagram (a six-pointed star), like the Star of David. The nth star number can be calculated using a specific formula.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The formula to find the nth star number is given by: `Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1`. This formula calculates the number of points in a star shape for a given n. We will implement this formula in a function to compute the nth star number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `find_star_num` that takes an integer `n` as input.
   - Use the formula `Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1` to calculate the nth star number.
   - Return the result.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**

```python
def find_star_num(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth star number using the formula
    # Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1
    star_number = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1
    # Return the calculated star number
    return star_number
```

This function will correctly compute the nth star number using the given formula.

    Title: Stars and bars
    Part: 1/1
    # Stars and bars

    Stars and bars is a mathematical technique for solving certain combinatorial problems.
    It occurs whenever you want to count the number of ways to group identical objects.

    ## Theorem

    The number of ways to put $n$ identical objects into $k$ labeled boxes is

    $$\binom{n + k - 1}{n}.$$

    The proof involves turning the objects into stars and separating the boxes using bars (therefore the name).
    E.g. we can represent with $\bigstar | \bigstar \bigstar |~| \bigstar \bigstar$ the following situation:
    in the first box is one object, in the second box are two objects, the third one is empty and in the last box are two objects.
    This is one way of dividing 5 objects into 4 boxes.

    It should be pretty obvious, that every partition can be represented using $n$ stars and $k - 1$ bars and every stars and bars permutation using $n$ stars and $k - 1$ bars represents one partition.
    Therefore the number of ways to divide $n$ identical objects into $k$ labeled boxes is the same number as there are permutations of $n$ stars and $k - 1$ bars.
    The [Binomial Coefficient](binomial-coefficients.md) gives us the desired formula.

    ## Number of non-negative integer sums

    This problem is a direct application of the theorem.

    You want to count the number of solution of the equation 

    $$x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = n$$

    with $x_i \ge 0$.

    Again we can represent a solution using stars and bars.
    E.g. the solution $1 + 3 + 0 = 4$ for $n = 4$, $k = 3$ can be represented using $\bigstar | \bigstar \bigstar \bigstar |$.

    It is easy to see, that this is exactly the stars and bars theorem.
    Therefore the solution is $\binom{n + k - 1}{n}$.

    ## Number of lower-bound integer sums

    This can easily be extended to integer sums with different lower bounds.
    I.e. we want to count the number of solutions for  the equation

    $$x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_k = n$$

    with $x_i \ge a_i$.

    After substituting $x_i' := x_i - a_i$ we receive the modified equation

    $$(x_1' + a_i) + (x_2' + a_i) + \dots + (x_k' + a_k) = n$$

    $$\Leftrightarrow ~ ~ x_1' + x_2' + \dots + x_k' = n - a_1 - a_2 - \dots - a_k$$

    with $x_i' \ge 0$.
    So we have reduced the problem to the simpler case with $x_i' \ge 0$ and again can apply the stars and bars theorem.

    ## Number of upper-bound integer sums

    With some help of the [Inclusion-Exclusion Principle](./inclusion-exclusion.md), you can also restrict the integers with upper bounds.
    See the [Number of upper-bound integer sums](./inclusion-exclusion.md#number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums) section in the corresponding article.

   We need to write a function that calculates the nth star number. A star number is a figurate number that represents a centered hexagram (a six-pointed star). The sequence of star numbers starts with 1, 13, 37, 73, etc. We need to find the formula for the nth star number and implement it in a function.

   This formula arises from the geometric arrangement of points in a star shape. We will use this formula to compute the nth star number.
