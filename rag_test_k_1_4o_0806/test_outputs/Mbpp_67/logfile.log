INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/67 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

The problem asks us to find the number of ways to partition a set of size `n` using Bell numbers. The Bell number for a given `n` represents the number of different ways to partition a set of `n` elements into non-empty subsets.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Bell Numbers**: Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that represent the number of ways to partition a set. For example, the Bell number for `n=0` is `1` (the empty set), for `n=1` is `1` (one element can only be in one subset), for `n=2` is `2` (either both elements are in one subset or each element is in its own subset), and so on.

2. **Recursive Formula**: Bell numbers can be calculated using a recursive formula:
   - \( B(n+1) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} B(k) \)
   - This means the Bell number for `n+1` is the sum of combinations of `n` taken `k` at a time multiplied by the Bell number of `k`.

3. **Iterative Calculation**: We can calculate Bell numbers iteratively using a table (or list) to store previously calculated Bell numbers to avoid redundant calculations.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a list `bell` with the first Bell number `B(0) = 1`.
2. For each number from `1` to `n`:
   - Initialize a temporary list `current` to store the Bell numbers for the current `n`.
   - Set the first element of `current` to the last element of `bell`.
   - For each `j` from `1` to `i` (where `i` is the current number):
     - Calculate the current Bell number using the formula: `current[j] = current[j-1] + bell[j-1]`.
   - Append the last element of `current` to `bell`.
3. Return the last element of `bell` which is `B(n)`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def bell_number(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the list with the first Bell number
    bell = [1]
    
    # Calculate Bell numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Initialize the current row with the first element
        current = [bell[-1]]
        
        # Fill the current row using the previous row
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            current.append(current[j - 1] + bell[j - 1])
        
        # Append the last element of the current row to the bell list
        bell.append(current[-1])
    
    # Return the nth Bell number
    return bell[n]
```

This code calculates the Bell number for a given `n` using an iterative approach, storing intermediate results to efficiently compute the desired Bell number.

    Title: Catalan Numbers
    Part: 1/1
    # Catalan Numbers
    Catalan numbers is a number sequence, which is found useful in a number of combinatorial problems, often involving recursively-defined objects.

    This sequence was named after the Belgian mathematician [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan), who lived in the 19th century. (In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).

    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):

     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \ldots$

    ### Application in some combinatorial problems

    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for

    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.
    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.
    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.
    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).
    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.
    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).
    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).
    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).
    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.
    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).


    ## Calculations

    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.

    ### Recursive formula
 
    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$

    $$C_n = \sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \geq 2$$

    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.

    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.

    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :

    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.

    #### C++ implementation 

    ```cpp
    const int MOD = ....
    const int MAX = ....
    int catalan[MAX];
    void init() {
        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;
        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {
            catalan[i] = 0;
            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {
                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;
                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {
                    catalan[i] -= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Analytical formula

    $$C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1} {\binom{2n}{n}}$$

    (here $\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).

    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \times n$ is given by $\binom{2n}{n}$.

    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \times n$.

    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$ are $\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as "bad" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above "bad" paths, obtaining the formula:

    $$C_n = \binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n + 1} \binom{2n}{n} , {n} \geq 0$$

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/67 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the Bell number for a given integer `n`. The Bell number represents the number of ways to partition a set of `n` elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Bell numbers can be calculated using a recursive relationship. The Bell number for `n` can be derived from the Bell numbers of smaller sets. Specifically, the Bell number `B(n)` can be calculated using the formula:
   
   \[
   B(n+1) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} B(k)
   \]

   This means that to find the Bell number for `n+1`, we sum up the products of binomial coefficients and Bell numbers for all `k` from `0` to `n`.

   We can use a dynamic programming approach to calculate Bell numbers up to `n` by storing previously calculated Bell numbers in a list and using them to calculate the next Bell number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function bell_number(n):
       Initialize a list `bell` with size `n+1` and set bell[0] = 1
       For i from 1 to n:
           Set bell[i] = 0
           For j from 0 to i-1:
               Calculate binomial coefficient C(i-1, j)
               Add C(i-1, j) * bell[j] to bell[i]
       Return bell[n]
   ```

        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    k = min(k, n - k)  # Take advantage of symmetry
    c = 1
    for i in range(k):
        c = c * (n - i) // (i + 1)
    return c

def bell_number(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize a list to store Bell numbers up to n
    bell = [0] * (n + 1)
    bell[0] = 1  # Base case: B(0) = 1

    # Calculate Bell numbers from 1 to n
