If there are duplicates, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To find duplicates in a list, we can use a set to track the numbers we have already seen. As we iterate through the list, we check if the current number is already in the set. If it is, we have found a duplicate and return `True`. If it is not, we add the number to the set and continue. If we finish iterating through the list without finding any duplicates, we return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function test_duplicate(arr):\n       create an empty set called seen_numbers\n       for each number in arr:\n           if number is in seen_numbers:\n               return True\n           else:\n               add number to seen_numbers\n       return False\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef test_duplicate(arr):\n    # Create an empty set to keep track of numbers we have seen\n    seen_numbers = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        # If the number is already in the set, we found a duplicate\n        if number in seen_numbers:\n            return True\n        # Otherwise, add the number to the set\n        else:\n            seen_numbers.add(number)\n    \n    # If we finish the loop without finding duplicates, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently checks for duplicates by leveraging the properties of a set, which allows for average O(1) time complexity for both membership checks and insertions."

On this board there are $15$ playing tiles numbered from 1 to 15. One cell is left empty (denoted by 0). You need to get the board to the position presented below by repeatedly moving one of the tiles to the free space:\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\ 13 & 14 & 15 & 0 \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    The game \"15 Puzzle\u201d was created by Noyes Chapman in 1880.\n\n    ## Existence Of The Solution\n\n    Let's consider this problem: given a position on the board, determine whether a sequence of moves which leads to a solution exists.\n\n    Suppose we have some position on the board:\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \\\\ a_5 & a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \\\\ a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    where one of the elements equals zero and indicates an empty cell $a_z  = 0$\n\n    Let\u2019s consider the permutation:\n\n    $$a_1 a_2 ... a_{z-1} a_{z+1} ... a_{15} a_{16}$$\n\n    i.e. the permutation of numbers corresponding to the position on the board without a zero element\n\n    Let $N$ be the number of inversions in this permutation (i.e. the number of such elements $a_i$  and $a_j$  that $i < j$, but $a_i  > a_j$).\n\n    Suppose $K$ is an index of a row where the empty element is located (i.e. using our convention, $K = (z - 1) \\div \\ 4 + 1$).\n\n    Then, **the solution exists iff $N + K$ is even**.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    The algorithm above can be illustrated with the following program code:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int a[16];\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        cin >> a[i];\n\n    int inv = 0;\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        if (a[i])\n            for (int j=0; j<i; ++j)\n                if (a[j] > a[i])\n                    ++inv;\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        if (a[i] == 0)\n            inv += 1 + i / 4;\n\n    puts ((inv & 1) ? \"No Solution\" : \"Solution Exists\");\n    ```\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    In 1879 Johnson proved that if $N + K$ is odd, then the solution doesn\u2019t exist, and in the same year Story proved that all positions when $N + K$ is even have a solution.\n\n    However, all these proofs were quite complex.\n\n    In 1999 Archer proposed a much simpler proof (you can download his article [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf)).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
