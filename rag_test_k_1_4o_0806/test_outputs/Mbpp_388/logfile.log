INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/388 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given integer `n`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1 (i.e., 2^0).
   - Continuously multiply by 2 to get the next power of 2.
   - Stop when the next power of 2 would be greater than `n`.
   - The last power of 2 that was less than or equal to `n` is the answer.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize power as 1
   While power * 2 is less than or equal to n:
       Multiply power by 2
   Return power
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def highest_Power_of_2(n: int) -> int:
    # Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1 (2^0)
    power = 1
    
    # Keep multiplying by 2 until the next power would exceed n
    while power * 2 <= n:
        power *= 2
    
    # Return the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n
    return power
```

This function initializes `power` to 1 and keeps doubling it until doubling again would exceed `n`. The last valid `power` is returned as the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

    Title: Finding Power of Factorial Divisor
    Part: 1/1
    # Finding Power of Factorial Divisor

    You are given two numbers $n$ and $k$. Find the largest power of $k$ $x$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $k^x$.

    ## Prime $k$ {data-toc-label="Prime k"}

    Let's first consider the case of prime $k$. The explicit expression for factorial

    $$n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \ldots (n-1) \cdot n$$

    Note that every $k$-th element of the product is divisible by $k$, i.e. adds $+1$ to the answer; the number of such elements is $\Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k}\Bigr\rfloor$.

    Next, every $k^2$-th element is divisible by $k^2$, i.e. adds another $+1$ to the answer (the first power of $k$ has already been counted in the previous paragraph). The number of such elements is $\Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k^2}\Bigr\rfloor$.

    And so on, for every $i$ each $k^i$-th element adds another $+1$ to the answer, and there are $\Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k^i}\Bigr\rfloor$ such elements.

    The final answer is

    $$\Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k}\Bigr\rfloor + \Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k^2}\Bigr\rfloor + \ldots + \Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k^i}\Bigr\rfloor + \ldots$$

    This result is also known as [Legendre's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula).
    The sum is of course finite, since only approximately the first $\log_k n$ elements are not zeros. Thus, the runtime of this algorithm is $O(\log_k n)$.

    ### Implementation

    ```cpp

    int fact_pow (int n, int k) {
    	int res = 0;
    	while (n) {
    		n /= k;
    		res += n;
    	}
    	return res;
    }

    ```

    ## Composite $k$ {data-toc-label="Composite k"}

    The same idea can't be applied directly. Instead we can factor $k$, representing it as $k = k_1^{p_1} \cdot \ldots \cdot k_m^{p_m}$. For each $k_i$, we find the number of times it is present in $n!$ using the algorithm described above - let's call this value $a_i$. The answer for composite $k$ will be

    $$\min_ {i=1 \ldots m} \dfrac{a_i}{p_i}$$

   We need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given number `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`, we can start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1, and keep doubling it until it exceeds `n`. The last power of 2 that does not exceed `n` is our answer.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a variable `power` to 1 (which is 2^0).
   While `power` is less than or equal to `n`:
       Double the value of `power`.
   Divide `power` by 2 to get the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.
   Return `power`.
