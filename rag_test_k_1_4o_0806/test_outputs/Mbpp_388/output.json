    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given number `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`, we can start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1, and keep doubling it until it exceeds `n`. The last power of 2 that does not exceed `n` is our answer.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a variable `power` to 1 (which is 2^0).\n   While `power` is less than or equal to `n`:\n       Double the value of `power`.\n   Divide `power` by 2 to get the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.\n   Return `power`.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef highest_Power_of_2(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize power to 1, which is 2^0\n    power = 1\n    \n    # Double the power until it exceeds n\n    while power <= n:\n        power *= 2\n    \n    # The loop exits when power is greater than n, so divide by 2 to get the largest power of 2 <= n\n    power //= 2\n    \n    # Return the result\n    return power\n```\n\nThis function starts with the smallest power of 2 and keeps doubling it until it surpasses `n`. The last valid power of 2 before it exceeds `n` is returned as the result.",
