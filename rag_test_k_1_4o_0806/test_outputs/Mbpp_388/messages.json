Find the largest power of $k$ $x$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $k^x$.\n\n    ## Prime $k$ {data-toc-label=\"Prime k\"}\n\n    Let's first consider the case of prime $k$. The explicit expression for factorial\n\n    $$n! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\ldots (n-1) \\cdot n$$\n\n    Note that every $k$-th element of the product is divisible by $k$, i.e. adds $+1$ to the answer; the number of such elements is $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k}\\Bigr\\rfloor$.\n\n    Next, every $k^2$-th element is divisible by $k^2$, i.e. adds another $+1$ to the answer (the first power of $k$ has already been counted in the previous paragraph). The number of such elements is $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^2}\\Bigr\\rfloor$.\n\n    And so on, for every $i$ each $k^i$-th element adds another $+1$ to the answer, and there are $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^i}\\Bigr\\rfloor$ such elements.\n\n    The final answer is\n\n    $$\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k}\\Bigr\\rfloor + \\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^2}\\Bigr\\rfloor + \\ldots + \\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^i}\\Bigr\\rfloor + \\ldots$$\n\n    This result is also known as [Legendre's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula).\n    The sum is of course finite, since only approximately the first $\\log_k n$ elements are not zeros. Thus, the runtime of this algorithm is $O(\\log_k n)$.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n\n    int fact_pow (int n, int k) {\n    \tint res = 0;\n    \twhile (n) {\n    \t\tn /= k;\n    \t\tres += n;\n    \t}\n    \treturn res;\n    }\n\n    ```\n\n    ## Composite $k$ {data-toc-label=\"Composite k\"}\n\n    The same idea can't be applied directly. Instead we can factor $k$, representing it as $k = k_1^{p_1} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot k_m^{p_m}$. For each $k_i$, we find the number of times it is present in $n!$ using the algorithm described above - let's call this value $a_i$. The answer for composite $k$ will be\n\n    $$\\min_ {i=1 \\ldots m} \\dfrac{a_i}{p_i}$$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
