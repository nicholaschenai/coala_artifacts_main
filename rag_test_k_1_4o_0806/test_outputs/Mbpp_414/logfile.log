### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if there is any common element between two sequences. If there is at least one common element, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input**: Two sequences (e.g., lists, tuples).
2. **Output**: A boolean value (`True` or `False`).
3. **Approach**:
   - Iterate through each element in the first sequence.
   - For each element, check if it exists in the second sequence.
   - If a common element is found, return `True`.
   - If no common elements are found after checking all elements, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

```
function overlapping(seq1, seq2):
    for each element in seq1:
        if element is in seq2:
            return True
    return False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def overlapping(seq1, seq2):
    # Iterate over each element in the first sequence
    for element in seq1:
        # Check if the current element is present in the second sequence
        if element in seq2:
            # If a common element is found, return True
            return True
    # If no common elements are found, return False
    return False

    Chapter: Data structures
    Section: Comparison to sorting
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Comparison to sorting}

    It is often possible to solve a problem
    using either data structures or sorting.
    Sometimes there are remarkable differences
    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,
    which may be hidden in their time complexities.

    Let us consider a problem where
    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$
    that both contain $n$ elements.
    Our task is to calculate the number of elements
    that belong to both of the lists.
    For example, for the lists
    \[A = [5,2,8,9] \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\]
    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5
    and 9 belong to both of the lists.

    A straightforward solution to the problem is
    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,
    but next we will focus on
    more efficient algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,
    and after this, we iterate through the elements
    of $B$ and check for each elements if it
    also belongs to $A$.
    This is efficient because the elements of $A$
    are in a set.
    Using the \texttt{set} structure,
    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,
    so instead of the \texttt{set} structure
    we can also use the \texttt{unordered\_set} structure.
    This is an easy way to make the algorithm
    more efficient, because we only have to change
    the underlying data structure.
    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.
    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.
    After this, we iterate through both the lists
    at the same time and find the common elements.
    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n)$,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    so the total time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    The following table shows how efficient
    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and
    the elements of the lists are random
    integers between $1 \ldots 10^9$:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\
    $2 \cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\
    $3 \cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\
    $4 \cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\
    $5 \cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that
    they use different set structures.
    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on
    the running time, because Algorithm 2
    is 4â€“5 times faster than Algorithm 1.

    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3
    which uses sorting.
    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.
    Interestingly, the time complexity of both
    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \log n)$,
    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.
    This can be explained by the fact that
    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done
    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.
    On the other hand,
    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree
    during the whole algorithm.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/414 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if there is any common element between two sequences (like lists or tuples). If there is at least one common element, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a set to store the elements of the first sequence. Then, we iterate through the second sequence and check if any of its elements are present in the set. If we find a common element, we return `True`. If we finish checking all elements without finding any common ones, we return `False`.

   ```
   Define function overlapping(seq1, seq2):
       Convert seq1 to a set called set1
       For each element in seq2:
           If the element is in set1:
