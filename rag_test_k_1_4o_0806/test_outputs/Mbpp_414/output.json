    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if there is any common element between two sequences (like lists or tuples). If there is at least one common element, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a set to store the elements of the first sequence. Then, we iterate through the second sequence and check if any of its elements are present in the set. If we find a common element, we return `True`. If we finish checking all elements without finding any common ones, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n       Convert seq1 to a set called set1\n       For each element in seq2:\n           If the element is in set1:\n               Return True\n       Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    # Convert the first sequence to a set for O(1) average time complexity lookups\n    set1 = set(seq1)\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the second sequence\n    for element in seq2:\n        # Check if the current element is in the set of the first sequence\n        if element in set1:\n            # If a common element is found, return True\n            return True\n    \n    # If no common elements are found, return False\n    return False\n```",
