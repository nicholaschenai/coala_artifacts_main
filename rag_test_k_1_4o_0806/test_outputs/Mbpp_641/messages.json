A nonagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the nonagon (a nine-sided polygon). The nth nonagonal number can be calculated using a specific formula.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth nonagonal number, we can use the formula for nonagonal numbers: \n   \\[\n   N(n) = \\frac{7n^2 - 5n}{2}\n   \\]\n   This formula gives us the nth nonagonal number directly. We will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth nonagonal number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function is_nonagonal(n):\n       Calculate nonagonal number using formula: (7 * n^2 - 5 * n) / 2\n       Return the calculated nonagonal number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_nonagonal(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth nonagonal number using the formula\n    nonagonal_number = (7 * n * n - 5 * n) // 2\n    # Return the calculated nonagonal number\n    return nonagonal_number\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the nth nonagonal number using the given formula."
