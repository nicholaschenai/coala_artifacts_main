    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes three integers as input and returns the count of how many of these integers are equal to each other.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to compare the three integers. There are a few possible scenarios:\n   - All three integers are the same.\n   - Two of the integers are the same, and the third is different.\n   - All three integers are different.\n\n   Based on these scenarios, we can determine the count of equal numbers:\n   - If all three are the same, the count is 3.\n   - If two are the same, the count is 2.\n   - If all are different, the count is 0.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function test_three_equal(a, b, c):\n       if a == b and b == c:\n           return 3\n       elif a == b or b == c or a == c:\n           return 2\n       else:\n           return 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef test_three_equal(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Check if all three numbers are equal\n    if a == b and b == c:\n        return 3\n    # Check if any two numbers are equal\n    elif a == b or b == c or a == c:\n        return 2\n    # If none of the above, all numbers are different\n    else:\n        return 0\n```\n\nThis function checks the equality of the three integers and returns the count of equal numbers based on the conditions described.",
