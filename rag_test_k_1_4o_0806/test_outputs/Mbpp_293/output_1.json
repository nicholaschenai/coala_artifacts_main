    "raw_msg": "Let's correct the solution by ensuring that we handle both scenarios: when the given sides are both legs of the triangle and when one of them is the hypotenuse. Here's the revised code:\n\n```python\ndef otherside_rightangle(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n    # Determine if we are given the hypotenuse or both legs\n    if a > b:\n        # a is the hypotenuse, b is a leg\n        hypotenuse = a\n        leg = b\n        # Calculate the other leg\n        third_side = (hypotenuse**2 - leg**2)**0.5\n    elif b > a:\n        # b is the hypotenuse, a is a leg\n        hypotenuse = b\n        leg = a\n        # Calculate the other leg\n        third_side = (hypotenuse**2 - leg**2)**0.5\n    else:\n        # Both are legs, calculate the hypotenuse\n        third_side = (a**2 + b**2)**0.5\n    \n    # Return the calculated length of the third side\n    return third_side\n```\n\nThis code correctly identifies whether the given sides are both legs or if one is the hypotenuse, and calculates the third side accordingly using the Pythagorean theorem.",
