INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/293 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle when given the lengths of the other two sides. The function should return the length of the third side as a floating-point number.

## Conceptual Solution

1. In a right-angled triangle, the relationship between the sides is given by the Pythagorean theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \), where \( c \) is the hypotenuse (the longest side), and \( a \) and \( b \) are the other two sides.
2. Given two sides, we need to determine if one of them is the hypotenuse or if we need to calculate the hypotenuse.
3. If one side is the hypotenuse, we can find the other side using the formula: \( \text{other side} = \sqrt{c^2 - a^2} \).
4. If neither side is the hypotenuse, we calculate the hypotenuse using: \( c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `otherside_rightangle(a, b)`.
2. Determine which side is the hypotenuse by comparing `a` and `b`.
3. If `a` is greater than `b`, assume `a` is the hypotenuse:
   - Calculate the other side using the formula: \( \text{other side} = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2} \).
4. If `b` is greater than `a`, assume `b` is the hypotenuse:
   - Calculate the other side using the formula: \( \text{other side} = \sqrt{b^2 - a^2} \).
5. If `a` and `b` are equal, calculate the hypotenuse using: \( c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).
6. Return the calculated side.

## Python Code

```python
def otherside_rightangle(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    # Determine which side is the hypotenuse
    if a > b:
        # a is the hypotenuse, calculate the other side
        return (a**2 - b**2) ** 0.5
    elif b > a:
        # b is the hypotenuse, calculate the other side
        return (b**2 - a**2) ** 0.5
    else:
        # a and b are equal, calculate the hypotenuse
        return (a**2 + b**2) ** 0.5
```

This code will correctly calculate the third side of a right-angled triangle given two sides, using the Pythagorean theorem.

    \index{Lagrange's theorem}

    \key{Lagrange's theorem}
    %\footnote{J.-L. Lagrange (1736--1813) was an Italian mathematician.}
    states that every positive integer
    can be represented as a sum of four squares, i.e.,
    $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$.
    For example, the number 123 can be represented
    as the sum $8^2+5^2+5^2+3^2$.

    \key{Zeckendorf's theorem}
    %\footnote{E. Zeckendorf published the theorem in 1972 \cite{zec72}; however, this was not a new result.}
    states that every
    positive integer has a unique representation
    as a sum of Fibonacci numbers such that
    no two numbers are equal or consecutive
    Fibonacci numbers.
    For example, the number 74 can be represented
    as the sum $55+13+5+1$.

    \subsubsection{Pythagorean triples}

    \index{Pythagorean triple}
    \index{Euclid's formula}

    A \key{Pythagorean triple} is a triple $(a,b,c)$
    that satisfies the Pythagorean theorem
    $a^2+b^2=c^2$, which means that there is a right triangle
    with side lengths $a$, $b$ and $c$.
    For example, $(3,4,5)$ is a Pythagorean triple.

    If $(a,b,c)$ is a Pythagorean triple,
    all triples of the form $(ka,kb,kc)$
    are also Pythagorean triples where $k>1$.
    A Pythagorean triple is \emph{primitive} if
    $a$, $b$ and $c$ are coprime,
    and all Pythagorean triples can be constructed
    from primitive triples using a multiplier $k$.

    \key{Euclid's formula} can be used to produce
    all primitive Pythagorean triples.
    Each such triple is of the form
    \[(n^2-m^2,2nm,n^2+m^2),\]
    where $0<m<n$, $n$ and $m$ are coprime
    and at least one of $n$ and $m$ is even.
    For example, when $m=1$ and $n=2$, the formula
    produces the smallest Pythagorean triple
    \[(2^2-1^2,2\cdot2\cdot1,2^2+1^2)=(3,4,5).\]

    \subsubsection{Wilson's theorem}

    \index{Wilson's theorem}

    \key{Wilson's theorem}
    %\footnote{J. Wilson (1741--1793) was an English mathematician.}
    states that a number $n$
    is prime exactly when
    \[(n-1)! \bmod n = n-1.\]
    For example, the number 11 is prime, because
    \[10! \bmod 11 = 10,\]
    and the number 12 is not prime, because
    \[11! \bmod 12 = 0 \neq 11.\]

    Hence, Wilson's theorem can be used to find out
    whether a number is prime. However, in practice, the theorem cannot be
    applied to large values of $n$, because it is difficult
    to calculate values of $(n-1)!$ when $n$ is large.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/293 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake occurred:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given two sides of a right-angled triangle and need to find the length of the third side.
   - The problem does not specify which of the given sides is the hypotenuse or if they are both legs of the triangle.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The Pythagorean theorem states: \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \), where \( c \) is the hypotenuse.
   - If we are given the hypotenuse and one leg, we should calculate the other leg using: \( \text{leg} = \sqrt{c^2 - \text{leg}^2} \).
   - If we are given both legs, we should calculate the hypotenuse using: \( c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

3. **Mistake in the Solution:**
   - The current solution assumes that one of the given sides is always the hypotenuse, which is incorrect.
   - The solution should check if the given sides are both legs or if one is the hypotenuse.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - If the given sides are both legs, calculate the hypotenuse.
   - If one side is the hypotenuse, calculate the missing leg.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
def otherside_rightangle(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    # Determine if we are given the hypotenuse or both legs
    if a > b:
        # a is the hypotenuse, b is a leg
        hypotenuse = a
        leg = b
        # Calculate the other leg
        third_side = (hypotenuse**2 - leg**2)**0.5
    elif b > a:
        # b is the hypotenuse, a is a leg
        hypotenuse = b
        leg = a
        # Calculate the other leg
        third_side = (hypotenuse**2 - leg**2)**0.5
    else:
        # Both are legs, calculate the hypotenuse
        third_side = (a**2 + b**2)**0.5
    
    # Return the calculated length of the third side
    return third_side
```

This solution correctly handles both scenarios: when one of the given sides is the hypotenuse and when both are legs.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/293 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution to identify where the mistake occurred:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given two sides of a right-angled triangle and need to find the length of the third side.
   - The problem does not specify which of the given sides is the hypotenuse or if they are both legs of the triangle.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The Pythagorean theorem states: \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \), where \( c \) is the hypotenuse.
   - If we are given the hypotenuse and one leg, we should calculate the other leg using: \( \text{leg} = \sqrt{c^2 - \text{leg}^2} \).
   - If we are given both legs, we should calculate the hypotenuse using: \( c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

3. **Mistake in the Solution:**
   - The current solution assumes that one of the given sides is always the hypotenuse, which is incorrect.
   - The solution should check if the given sides are both legs or if one is the hypotenuse.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - If the given sides are both legs, calculate the hypotenuse.
   - If one side is the hypotenuse, calculate the missing leg.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
def otherside_rightangle(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    # Determine if we are given the hypotenuse or both legs
    if a > b:
        # a is the hypotenuse, b is a leg
        hypotenuse = a
        leg = b
        # Calculate the other leg
        third_side = (hypotenuse**2 - leg**2)**0.5
    elif b > a:
        # b is the hypotenuse, a is a leg
        hypotenuse = b
        leg = a
        # Calculate the other leg
        third_side = (hypotenuse**2 - leg**2)**0.5
    else:
        # Both are legs, calculate the hypotenuse
        third_side = (a**2 + b**2)**0.5
    
    # Return the calculated length of the third side
    return third_side
```

This solution correctly handles both scenarios: when one of the given sides is the hypotenuse and when both are legs.

    Title: Basic Geometry
    Part: 2/3
    ```

    To see the next important property we should take a look at the set of points $\mathbf r$ for which $\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf a = C$ for some fixed constant $C$.
    You can see that this set of points is exactly the set of points for which the projection onto $\mathbf a$ is the point $C \cdot \dfrac{\mathbf a}{|\mathbf a|}$ and they form a hyperplane orthogonal to $\mathbf a$.
    You can see the vector $\mathbf a$ alongside with several such vectors having same dot product with it in 2D on the picture below:

    <center>![Vectors having same dot product with a](https://i.imgur.com/eyO7St4.png)</center>

    In 2D these vectors will form a line, in 3D they will form a plane.
    Note that this result allows us to define a line in 2D as $\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n=C$ or $(\mathbf r - \mathbf r_0)\cdot \mathbf n=0$ where $\mathbf n$ is vector orthogonal to the line and $\mathbf r_0$ is any vector already present on the line and $C = \mathbf r_0\cdot \mathbf n$.
    In the same manner a plane can be defined in 3D.

    ## Cross product

    ### Definition

    Assume you have three vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ in 3D space joined in a parallelepiped as in the picture below:
    <center>![Three vectors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Parallelepiped_volume.svg/240px-Parallelepiped_volume.svg.png)</center>

    How would you calculate its volume?
    From school we know that we should multiply the area of the base with the height, which is projection of $\mathbf a$ onto direction orthogonal to base.
    That means that if we define $\mathbf b \times \mathbf c$ as the vector which is orthogonal to both $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ and which length is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ then $|\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times\mathbf c)|$ will be equal to the volume of the parallelepiped.
    For integrity we will say that $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ will be always directed in such way that the rotation from the vector $\mathbf b$ to the vector $\mathbf c$ from the point of $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ is always counter-clockwise (see the picture below).

    <center>![cross product](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Cross_product_vector.svg/250px-Cross_product_vector.svg.png)</center>

    This defines the cross (or vector) product $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ of the vectors $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ and the triple product $\mathbf a\cdot(\mathbf b\times \mathbf c)$ of the vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$.

    Some notable properties of cross and triple products:

    1.  $\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = -\mathbf b\times \mathbf a$
    2.  $(\alpha \cdot \mathbf a)\times \mathbf b = \alpha \cdot (\mathbf a\times \mathbf b)$
    3.  For any $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ there is exactly one vector $\mathbf r$ such that $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf a\cdot\mathbf r$ for any vector $\mathbf a$. <br>Indeed if there are two such vectors $\mathbf r_1$ and $\mathbf r_2$ then $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf r_1 - \mathbf r_2)=0$ for all vectors $\mathbf a$ which is possible only when $\mathbf r_1 = \mathbf r_2$.
    4.  $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf b\cdot (\mathbf c\times \mathbf a) = -\mathbf a\cdot( \mathbf c\times \mathbf b)$
    5.  $(\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c = \mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c$.
        Indeed for all vectors $\mathbf r$ the chain of equations holds:

        \[\mathbf r\cdot( (\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c) = (\mathbf a + \mathbf b) \cdot (\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) =  \mathbf a \cdot(\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) + \mathbf b\cdot(\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) = \mathbf r\cdot (\mathbf a\times \mathbf c) + \mathbf r\cdot(\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf r\cdot(\mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c)\]

        Which proves $(\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c = \mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ due to point 3.

    6.  $|\mathbf a\times \mathbf b|=|\mathbf a| \cdot |\mathbf b| \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is angle between $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$, since $|\mathbf a\times \mathbf b|$ equals to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$. 

    Given all this and that the following equation holds for the unit vectors

    $$\mathbf e_x\times \mathbf e_x = \mathbf e_y\times \mathbf e_y = \mathbf e_z\times \mathbf e_z = \mathbf 0,\\
    \mathbf e_x\times \mathbf e_y = \mathbf e_z,~\mathbf e_y\times \mathbf e_z = \mathbf e_x,~\mathbf e_z\times \mathbf e_x = \mathbf e_y$$

    we can calculate the cross product of $\mathbf a = (x_1;y_1;z_1)$ and $\mathbf b = (x_2;y_2;z_2)$ in coordinate form:

    $$\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = (x_1 \cdot \mathbf e_x + y_1 \cdot \mathbf e_y + z_1 \cdot \mathbf e_z)\times (x_2 \cdot \mathbf e_x + y_2 \cdot \mathbf e_y + z_2 \cdot \mathbf e_z) =$$

    $$(y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2)\mathbf e_x  + (z_1 x_2 - x_1 z_2)\mathbf e_y + (x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2)$$

    Which also can be written in the more elegant form:

    $$\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = \begin{vmatrix}\mathbf e_x & \mathbf e_y & \mathbf e_z \\ x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \end{vmatrix},~a\cdot(b\times c) = \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\ x_3 & y_3 & z_3 \end{vmatrix}$$

    Here $| \cdot |$ stands for the determinant of a matrix. 

    Some kind of cross product (namely the pseudo-scalar product) can also be implemented in the 2D case.
    If we would like to calculate the area of parallelogram formed by vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ we would compute $|\mathbf e_z\cdot(\mathbf a\times \mathbf b)| = |x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2|$.
    Another way to obtain the same result is to multiply $|\mathbf a|$ (base of parallelogram) with the height, which is the projection of vector $\mathbf b$ onto vector $\mathbf a$ rotated by $90^\circ$ which in turn is $\widehat{\mathbf a}=(-y_1;x_1)$.
    That is, to calculate $|\widehat{\mathbf a}\cdot\mathbf b|=|x_1y_2 - y_1 x_2|$. 

    If we will take the sign into consideration then the area will be positive if the rotation from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ (i.e. from the view of the point of $\mathbf e_z$) is performed counter-clockwise and negative otherwise.
    That defines the pseudo-scalar product.
    Note that it also equals $|\mathbf a| \cdot |\mathbf b| \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is angle from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ count counter-clockwise (and negative if rotation is clockwise).

    Let's implement all this stuff!

    ```{.cpp file=crossproduct}
    point3d cross(point3d a, point3d b) {
        return point3d(a.y * b.z - a.z * b.y,
                       a.z * b.x - a.x * b.z,
                       a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x);
    }
    ftype triple(point3d a, point3d b, point3d c) {
        return dot(a, cross(b, c));
    }
    ftype cross(point2d a, point2d b) {
        return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/293 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle when given the lengths of the other two sides. The function should return the length of the third side as a floating-point number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   In a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Given two sides, we can determine if one of them is the hypotenuse by comparing their lengths. If one side is longer, it is the hypotenuse. If both sides are equal, either can be considered the hypotenuse. We then use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the third side.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function otherside_rightangle(a, b):
       If a > b:
           hypotenuse = a
           other_side = b
       Else:
           hypotenuse = b
           other_side = a
       
       Calculate the third side using the Pythagorean theorem:
       third_side = sqrt(hypotenuse^2 - other_side^2)
       
       Return third_side
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def otherside_rightangle(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    # Determine which side is the hypotenuse
    if a > b:
        hypotenuse = a
        other_side = b
    else:
        hypotenuse = b
        other_side = a
    
    # Calculate the length of the third side using the Pythagorean theorem
    # third_side^2 = hypotenuse^2 - other_side^2
    third_side = (hypotenuse**2 - other_side**2)**0.5
    
    # Return the calculated length of the third side
    return third_side
```

This function will correctly compute the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of the other two sides.

   - If we are given both legs, we should calculate the hypotenuse using: \( c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

3. **Mistake in the Solution:**
   - The current solution assumes that one of the given sides is always the hypotenuse, which is incorrect.
   - The solution should check if the given sides are both legs or if one is the hypotenuse.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - If the given sides are both legs, calculate the hypotenuse.
   - If one side is the hypotenuse, calculate the missing leg.

5. **Re-evaluation of the Test Case:**
   - The test case `otherside_rightangle(7,8)` expects the result to be `10.63014581273465`.
   - This indicates that both 7 and 8 are legs, and we need to calculate the hypotenuse.

Let's correct the solution:

```python
def otherside_rightangle(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the hypotenuse when both sides are legs
    third_side = (a**2 + b**2)**0.5
    
    # Return the calculated length of the hypotenuse
    return third_side
```

This solution assumes that both given sides are legs of the triangle, which aligns with the test case provided.

and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/293 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle when given the lengths of the other two sides. The function should return the length of the third side as a floating-point number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   In a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Given two sides, we can determine if one of them is the hypotenuse by comparing their lengths. If one side is longer, it is the hypotenuse. If both sides are equal, either can be considered the hypotenuse. We then use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the third side.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function otherside_rightangle(a, b):
       If a > b:
           hypotenuse = a
           other_side = b
       Else:
           hypotenuse = b
           other_side = a
       
       Calculate the third side using the Pythagorean theorem:
       third_side = sqrt(hypotenuse^2 - other_side^2)
       
       Return third_side
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def otherside_rightangle(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    # Determine which side is the hypotenuse
    if a > b:
        hypotenuse = a
        other_side = b
    else:
        hypotenuse = b
        other_side = a
    
    # Calculate the length of the third side using the Pythagorean theorem
    # third_side^2 = hypotenuse^2 - other_side^2
    third_side = (hypotenuse**2 - other_side**2)**0.5
    
    # Return the calculated length of the third side
    return third_side
```

This function will correctly compute the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of the other two sides.

    Title: Basic Geometry
    Part: 2/3
    ```

    To see the next important property we should take a look at the set of points $\mathbf r$ for which $\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf a = C$ for some fixed constant $C$.
    You can see that this set of points is exactly the set of points for which the projection onto $\mathbf a$ is the point $C \cdot \dfrac{\mathbf a}{|\mathbf a|}$ and they form a hyperplane orthogonal to $\mathbf a$.
    You can see the vector $\mathbf a$ alongside with several such vectors having same dot product with it in 2D on the picture below:

    <center>![Vectors having same dot product with a](https://i.imgur.com/eyO7St4.png)</center>

    In 2D these vectors will form a line, in 3D they will form a plane.
    Note that this result allows us to define a line in 2D as $\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n=C$ or $(\mathbf r - \mathbf r_0)\cdot \mathbf n=0$ where $\mathbf n$ is vector orthogonal to the line and $\mathbf r_0$ is any vector already present on the line and $C = \mathbf r_0\cdot \mathbf n$.
    In the same manner a plane can be defined in 3D.

    ## Cross product

    ### Definition

    Assume you have three vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ in 3D space joined in a parallelepiped as in the picture below:
    <center>![Three vectors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Parallelepiped_volume.svg/240px-Parallelepiped_volume.svg.png)</center>

    How would you calculate its volume?
    From school we know that we should multiply the area of the base with the height, which is projection of $\mathbf a$ onto direction orthogonal to base.
    That means that if we define $\mathbf b \times \mathbf c$ as the vector which is orthogonal to both $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ and which length is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ then $|\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times\mathbf c)|$ will be equal to the volume of the parallelepiped.
    For integrity we will say that $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ will be always directed in such way that the rotation from the vector $\mathbf b$ to the vector $\mathbf c$ from the point of $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ is always counter-clockwise (see the picture below).

    <center>![cross product](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Cross_product_vector.svg/250px-Cross_product_vector.svg.png)</center>

    This defines the cross (or vector) product $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ of the vectors $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ and the triple product $\mathbf a\cdot(\mathbf b\times \mathbf c)$ of the vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$.

    Some notable properties of cross and triple products:

    1.  $\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = -\mathbf b\times \mathbf a$
    2.  $(\alpha \cdot \mathbf a)\times \mathbf b = \alpha \cdot (\mathbf a\times \mathbf b)$
    3.  For any $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ there is exactly one vector $\mathbf r$ such that $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf a\cdot\mathbf r$ for any vector $\mathbf a$. <br>Indeed if there are two such vectors $\mathbf r_1$ and $\mathbf r_2$ then $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf r_1 - \mathbf r_2)=0$ for all vectors $\mathbf a$ which is possible only when $\mathbf r_1 = \mathbf r_2$.
    4.  $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf b\cdot (\mathbf c\times \mathbf a) = -\mathbf a\cdot( \mathbf c\times \mathbf b)$
    5.  $(\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c = \mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c$.
        Indeed for all vectors $\mathbf r$ the chain of equations holds:

        \[\mathbf r\cdot( (\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c) = (\mathbf a + \mathbf b) \cdot (\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) =  \mathbf a \cdot(\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) + \mathbf b\cdot(\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) = \mathbf r\cdot (\mathbf a\times \mathbf c) + \mathbf r\cdot(\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf r\cdot(\mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c)\]

        Which proves $(\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c = \mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ due to point 3.

    6.  $|\mathbf a\times \mathbf b|=|\mathbf a| \cdot |\mathbf b| \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is angle between $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$, since $|\mathbf a\times \mathbf b|$ equals to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$. 

    Given all this and that the following equation holds for the unit vectors

    $$\mathbf e_x\times \mathbf e_x = \mathbf e_y\times \mathbf e_y = \mathbf e_z\times \mathbf e_z = \mathbf 0,\\
    \mathbf e_x\times \mathbf e_y = \mathbf e_z,~\mathbf e_y\times \mathbf e_z = \mathbf e_x,~\mathbf e_z\times \mathbf e_x = \mathbf e_y$$

    we can calculate the cross product of $\mathbf a = (x_1;y_1;z_1)$ and $\mathbf b = (x_2;y_2;z_2)$ in coordinate form:

    $$\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = (x_1 \cdot \mathbf e_x + y_1 \cdot \mathbf e_y + z_1 \cdot \mathbf e_z)\times (x_2 \cdot \mathbf e_x + y_2 \cdot \mathbf e_y + z_2 \cdot \mathbf e_z) =$$

    $$(y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2)\mathbf e_x  + (z_1 x_2 - x_1 z_2)\mathbf e_y + (x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2)$$

    Which also can be written in the more elegant form:

    $$\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = \begin{vmatrix}\mathbf e_x & \mathbf e_y & \mathbf e_z \\ x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \end{vmatrix},~a\cdot(b\times c) = \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\ x_3 & y_3 & z_3 \end{vmatrix}$$

    Here $| \cdot |$ stands for the determinant of a matrix. 

    Some kind of cross product (namely the pseudo-scalar product) can also be implemented in the 2D case.
    If we would like to calculate the area of parallelogram formed by vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ we would compute $|\mathbf e_z\cdot(\mathbf a\times \mathbf b)| = |x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2|$.
    Another way to obtain the same result is to multiply $|\mathbf a|$ (base of parallelogram) with the height, which is the projection of vector $\mathbf b$ onto vector $\mathbf a$ rotated by $90^\circ$ which in turn is $\widehat{\mathbf a}=(-y_1;x_1)$.
    That is, to calculate $|\widehat{\mathbf a}\cdot\mathbf b|=|x_1y_2 - y_1 x_2|$. 

    If we will take the sign into consideration then the area will be positive if the rotation from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ (i.e. from the view of the point of $\mathbf e_z$) is performed counter-clockwise and negative otherwise.
    That defines the pseudo-scalar product.
    Note that it also equals $|\mathbf a| \cdot |\mathbf b| \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is angle from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ count counter-clockwise (and negative if rotation is clockwise).

    Let's implement all this stuff!

    ```{.cpp file=crossproduct}
    point3d cross(point3d a, point3d b) {
        return point3d(a.y * b.z - a.z * b.y,

    }
    ftype triple(point3d a, point3d b, point3d c) {
        return dot(a, cross(b, c));
    }
