    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle when given the lengths of the other two sides. The function should return the length of the third side as a floating-point number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   In a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Given two sides, we can determine if one of them is the hypotenuse by comparing their lengths. If one side is longer, it is the hypotenuse. If both sides are equal, either can be considered the hypotenuse. We then use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the third side.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function otherside_rightangle(a, b):\n       If a > b:\n           hypotenuse = a\n           other_side = b\n       Else:\n           hypotenuse = b\n           other_side = a\n       \n       Calculate the third side using the Pythagorean theorem:\n       third_side = sqrt(hypotenuse^2 - other_side^2)\n       \n       Return third_side\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef otherside_rightangle(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n    # Determine which side is the hypotenuse\n    if a > b:\n        hypotenuse = a\n        other_side = b\n    else:\n        hypotenuse = b\n        other_side = a\n    \n    # Calculate the length of the third side using the Pythagorean theorem\n    # third_side^2 = hypotenuse^2 - other_side^2\n    third_side = (hypotenuse**2 - other_side**2)**0.5\n    \n    # Return the calculated length of the third side\n    return third_side\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of the other two sides.",
