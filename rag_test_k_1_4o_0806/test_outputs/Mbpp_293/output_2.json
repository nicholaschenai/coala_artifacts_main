    "raw_msg": "Let's revisit the problem and the solution to ensure we are addressing the requirements correctly:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We are given two sides of a right-angled triangle and need to find the length of the third side.\n   - The test case `otherside_rightangle(7,8)` expects the result to be `10.63014581273465`, which suggests that both 7 and 8 are legs of the triangle, and we need to calculate the hypotenuse.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Solution:**\n   - The Pythagorean theorem states: \\( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\), where \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse.\n   - If both given sides are legs, we calculate the hypotenuse using: \\( c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n\n3. **Mistake in the Solution:**\n   - The previous solution incorrectly assumed that one of the given sides could be the hypotenuse, which was not the case for the provided test.\n\n4. **Correct Approach:**\n   - Assume both given sides are legs and calculate the hypotenuse.\n\nLet's correct the solution with this understanding:\n\n```python\ndef otherside_rightangle(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the hypotenuse when both sides are legs\n    third_side = (a**2 + b**2)**0.5\n    \n    # Return the calculated length of the hypotenuse\n    return third_side\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that both given sides are legs of the triangle, which aligns with the test case provided.",
