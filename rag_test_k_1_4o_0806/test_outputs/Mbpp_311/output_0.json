    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and sets the leftmost unset (0) bit in its binary representation to 1. The function should return the new integer value after this modification.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to identify the leftmost bit in the binary representation of the number that is currently unset (0) and set it to 1. We can achieve this by iterating through the bits of the number from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost) until we find a 0. Once we find this 0, we set it to 1 using a bitwise OR operation with a mask that has only that bit set to 1.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function set_left_most_unset_bit(n):\n       bit_position = 0\n       while (1 << bit_position) <= n:\n           if (n & (1 << bit_position)) == 0:\n               n = n | (1 << bit_position)\n               return n\n           bit_position += 1\n       # If all bits up to the current number are set, set the next bit\n       n = n | (1 << bit_position)\n       return n\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n: int) -> int:\n    # Start checking from the least significant bit\n    bit_position = 0\n    \n    # Continue until the bit position exceeds the current number\n    while (1 << bit_position) <= n:\n        # Check if the current bit is unset (0)\n        if (n & (1 << bit_position)) == 0:\n            # Set the current bit to 1\n            n = n | (1 << bit_position)\n            return n\n        # Move to the next bit position\n        bit_position += 1\n    \n    # If all bits up to the current number are set, set the next bit\n    n = n | (1 << bit_position)\n    return n\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the bits of the number, checking each one to see if it is unset. When it finds the first unset bit, it sets it and returns the modified number. If all bits up to the current number are set, it sets the next higher bit.",
