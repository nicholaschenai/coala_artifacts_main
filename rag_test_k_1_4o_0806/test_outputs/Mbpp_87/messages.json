If there are any duplicate keys among the dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary with that key should be used in the merged dictionary.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will take three dictionaries as input.\n2. We will create a new dictionary to store the merged result.\n3. We will update this new dictionary with the key-value pairs from each of the three input dictionaries in sequence.\n4. If a key appears in more than one dictionary, the value from the last dictionary containing that key will be used.\n5. Finally, we will return the merged dictionary.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):\n    create an empty dictionary called merged_dict\n    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict1\n    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict2\n    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict3\n    return merged_dict\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries_three(dict1: dict, dict2: dict, dict3: dict) -> dict:\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store the merged result\n    merged_dict = {}\n    \n    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the first dictionary\n    merged_dict.update(dict1)\n    \n    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the second dictionary\n    merged_dict.update(dict2)\n    \n    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the third dictionary\n    merged_dict.update(dict3)\n    \n    # Return the merged dictionary\n    return merged_dict\n```"
