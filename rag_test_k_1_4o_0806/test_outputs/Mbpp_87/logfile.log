INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/87 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes three dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any duplicate keys among the dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary with that key should be used in the merged dictionary.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will take three dictionaries as input.
2. We will create a new dictionary to store the merged result.
3. We will update this new dictionary with the key-value pairs from each of the three input dictionaries in sequence.
4. If a key appears in more than one dictionary, the value from the last dictionary containing that key will be used.
5. Finally, we will return the merged dictionary.

## Pseudocode

```
function merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):
    create an empty dictionary called merged_dict
    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict1
    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict2
    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict3
    return merged_dict
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1: dict, dict2: dict, dict3: dict) -> dict:
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the merged result
    merged_dict = {}
    
    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the first dictionary
    merged_dict.update(dict1)
    
    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the second dictionary
    merged_dict.update(dict2)
    
    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the third dictionary
    merged_dict.update(dict3)
    
    # Return the merged dictionary
    return merged_dict
```

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
