INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/269 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

The task is to write a function that takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value. The ASCII value is a numerical representation of a character in the ASCII table.

## Conceptual Solution

1. The input to the function will be a single character string.
2. We need to find the ASCII value of this character.
3. In Python, the built-in function `ord()` can be used to get the ASCII value of a character.
4. The function will return the result of `ord()` applied to the input character.

## Pseudocode

```
function ascii_value(character):
    return ord(character)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def ascii_value(character: str) -> int:
    # Use the built-in ord() function to get the ASCII value of the character
    return ord(character)
```

    # Balanced Ternary

    !["Setun computer using Balanced Ternary system"](https://earltcampbell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/setun.jpeg?w=300)

    This is a non-standard but still positional **numeral system**. Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.
    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,
    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the
    computers utilizing it.

    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:

    ```nohighlight
        0    0
        1    1
        2    1Z
        3    10
        4    11
        5    1ZZ
        6    1Z0
        7    1Z1
        8    10Z
        9    100
    ```

    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.

    ```nohighlight
        -1   Z
        -2   Z1
        -3   Z0
        -4   ZZ
        -5   Z11
    ```

    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.

    ## Conversion algorithm

    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is
    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,
    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -
    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.

    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.

    The final result is `1Z101`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \cdot 1 + 27 \cdot (-1) + 9 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$

    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.

    The final result is `100Z10`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \cdot 1 + 81 \cdot 0 + 27 \cdot 0 + 9 \cdot (-1) + 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$

   We need to write a function that takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   In Python, we can use the built-in function `ord()` to get the ASCII value of a character. The function `ord()` takes a single character as input and returns its corresponding ASCII integer value. We will define a function named `ascii_value` that uses `ord()` to return the ASCII value of the input character.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `ascii_value` that takes one parameter `char`.
   - Use the `ord()` function to get the ASCII value of `char`.
   - Return the result from `ord()`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def ascii_value(char: str) -> int:
    # Use the ord() function to get the ASCII value of the character
    return ord(char)
```

This function will correctly return the ASCII value of the input character, as demonstrated by the assertion `assert ascii_value('A') == 65`.
