INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/392 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function `get_max_sum(n)` that calculates the maximum sum possible using the equation `f(n) = max((f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5)), n)`. The function should return the maximum sum for a given integer `n`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - The function `f(n)` is defined recursively. For a given `n`, it compares two values:
     - The sum of the function applied to the integer divisions of `n` by 2, 3, 4, and 5.
     - The value of `n` itself.
   - The function should return the maximum of these two values.
   - To avoid recalculating values for the same `n` multiple times, we can use memoization to store already computed results.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function get_max_sum(n):
       Create a dictionary memo to store computed results

       Define a helper function f(x):
           If x is in memo, return memo[x]
           If x is 0, return 0
           Calculate sum_parts as f(x//2) + f(x//3) + f(x//4) + f(x//5)
           Calculate result as max(sum_parts, x)
           Store result in memo with key x
           Return result

       Return f(n)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def get_max_sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Dictionary to store already computed results for memoization
    memo = {}

    # Helper function to compute f(x) using recursion and memoization
    def f(x: int) -> int:
        # If the result for x is already computed, return it
        if x in memo:
            return memo[x]
        # Base case: if x is 0, the maximum sum is 0
        if x == 0:
            return 0
        # Calculate the sum of f(x//2), f(x//3), f(x//4), and f(x//5)
        sum_parts = f(x // 2) + f(x // 3) + f(x // 4) + f(x // 5)
        # The result is the maximum of sum_parts and x itself
        result = max(sum_parts, x)
        # Store the result in the memo dictionary
        memo[x] = result
        return result

    # Return the result of f(n)
    return f(n)

    Section: Maximum subarray sum
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Maximum subarray sum}

    \index{maximum subarray sum}

    There are often several possible algorithms
    for solving a problem such that their
    time complexities are different.
    This section discusses a classic problem that
    has a straightforward $O(n^3)$ solution.
    However, by designing a better algorithm, it
    is possible to solve the problem in $O(n^2)$
    time and even in $O(n)$ time.

    Given an array of $n$ numbers,
    our task is to calculate the
    \key{maximum subarray sum}, i.e.,
    the largest possible sum of 
    a sequence of consecutive values
    in the array\footnote{J. Bentley's
    book \emph{Programming Pearls} \cite{ben86} made the problem popular.}.
    The problem is interesting when there may be
    negative values in the array.
    For example, in the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{samepage}
    the following subarray produces the maximum sum $10$:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (6,1);
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \end{samepage}

    We assume that an empty subarray is allowed,
    so the maximum subarray sum is always at least $0$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    A straightforward way to solve the problem
    is to go through all possible subarrays,
    calculate the sum of values in each subarray and maintain
    the maximum sum.
    The following code implements this algorithm:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int k = a; k <= b; k++) {
                sum += array[k];
            }
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The variables \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} fix the first and
    last index of the subarray,
    and the sum of values is calculated to the variable \texttt{sum}.
    The variable \texttt{best} contains the maximum sum found during the search.

    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^3)$,
    because it consists of three nested loops 
    that go through the input.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is easy to make Algorithm 1 more efficient
    by removing one loop from it.
    This is possible by calculating the sum at the same
    time when the right end of the subarray moves.
    The result is the following code:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            sum += array[b];
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this change, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Surprisingly, it is possible to solve the problem
    in $O(n)$ time\footnote{In \cite{ben86}, this linear-time algorithm
    is attributed to J. B. Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes
    called \index{Kadane's algorithm} \key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means
    that just one loop is enough.
    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,
    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.
    After this, the answer for the problem is the
    maximum of those sums.

    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray
    that ends at position $k$.
    There are two possibilities:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.
    \item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends
    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.
    \end{enumerate}

    In the latter case, since we want to
    find a subarray with maximum sum,
    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$
    should also have the maximum sum.
    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently
    by calculating the maximum subarray sum
    for each ending position from left to right.

    The following code implements the algorithm:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0, sum = 0;
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);
        best = max(best,sum);
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The algorithm only contains one loop
    that goes through the input,
    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.
    This is also the best possible time complexity,
    because any algorithm for the problem
    has to examine all array elements at least once.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    It is interesting to study how efficient 
    algorithms are in practice.
    The following table shows the running times
    of the above algorithms for different
    values of $n$ on a modern computer.

    In each test, the input was generated randomly.
    The time needed for reading the input was not
    measured.

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    array size $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^2$ & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^3$ & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^4$ & > $10.0$ s & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^5$ & > $10.0$ s & $5.3$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^6$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^7$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    The comparison shows that all algorithms
    are efficient when the input size is small,
    but larger inputs bring out remarkable
    differences in the running times of the algorithms.
    Algorithm 1 becomes slow
    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2
    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.
    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process
    even the largest inputs instantly.

   We need to write a function `get_max_sum(n)` that calculates the maximum sum possible using the equation `f(n) = max((f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5)), n)`. The function should return the maximum sum for a given integer `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The problem is recursive in nature. For a given number `n`, we need to decide whether to take `n` itself or the sum of the results of the function applied to `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`. This is a classic dynamic programming problem where we can use memoization to store already computed results for subproblems to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

           If x is in memo, return memo[x]
           If x is less than 1, return 0
           Calculate result as max(x, f(x/2) + f(x/3) + f(x/4) + f(x/5))
