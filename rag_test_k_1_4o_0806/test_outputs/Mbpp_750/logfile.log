INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/750 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the original list followed by all the elements of the tuple.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The task is to combine the elements of a tuple with a list. In Python, we can achieve this by converting the tuple into a list and then concatenating it with the original list. This will result in a new list that contains all the elements from both the original list and the tuple.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `add_tuple` that takes two parameters: a list and a tuple.
   - Convert the tuple into a list.
   - Concatenate the list version of the tuple to the original list.
   - Return the concatenated list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def add_tuple(lst: list, tpl: tuple) -> list:
    # Convert the tuple to a list
    tuple_as_list = list(tpl)
    # Concatenate the list with the converted tuple list
    result = lst + tuple_as_list
    # Return the resulting list
    return result
```

This function will take a list and a tuple, convert the tuple to a list, concatenate it with the original list, and return the combined list.

        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\frac{x+y \sqrt{n}}{z}$.

    !!! example "[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)"
        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            x, k = map(int, input().split())

            mod = 10**9+7
        
            # compose (A[0]*x + A[1]) / (A[2]*x + A[3]) and (B[0]*x + B[1]) / (B[2]*x + B[3])
            def combine(A, B):
                return [t % mod for t in [A[0]*B[0]+A[1]*B[2], A[0]*B[1]+A[1]*B[3], A[2]*B[0]+A[3]*B[2], A[2]*B[1]+A[3]*B[3]]]

            A = [1, 0, 0, 1] # (x + 0) / (0*x + 1) = x

            a = sqrt(x)

            T = len(a) - 1 # period of a

            # apply ak + 1/x = (ak*x+1)/(1x+0) to (Ax + B) / (Cx + D)
            for i in reversed(range(1, len(a))):
                A = combine([a[i], 1, 1, 0], A)
