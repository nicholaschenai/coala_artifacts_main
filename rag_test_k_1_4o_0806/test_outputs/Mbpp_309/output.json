    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the maximum of two numbers, we can compare them using a simple conditional statement. If the first number is greater than or equal to the second number, then the first number is the maximum. Otherwise, the second number is the maximum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function maximum(a, b):\n       if a is greater than or equal to b:\n           return a\n       else:\n           return b\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef maximum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Compare the two numbers\n    if a >= b:\n        # If a is greater than or equal to b, return a\n        return a\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, return b\n        return b\n```\n\nThis function `maximum` takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns the larger of the two. The logic is straightforward: it uses an `if` statement to compare the two numbers and returns the appropriate one based on the comparison.",
