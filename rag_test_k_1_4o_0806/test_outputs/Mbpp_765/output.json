    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that finds the nth polite number. A polite number is a positive integer that is not a power of two. The function should return the nth polite number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth polite number, we can iterate through positive integers, checking each one to see if it is a power of two. If it is not a power of two, it is a polite number, and we count it. We continue this process until we have found the nth polite number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter for polite numbers found to 0\n   Initialize a number to check starting from 1\n\n   While the counter is less than n:\n       Check if the current number is a power of two\n       If it is not a power of two:\n           Increment the polite number counter\n       Increment the number to check\n\n   Return the last number checked that was a polite number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two(x: int) -> bool:\n    # A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation.\n    # This can be checked using the condition (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and x != 0.\n    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and x != 0\n\ndef is_polite(n: int) -> int:\n    polite_count = 0  # Counter for polite numbers found\n    number = 1  # Start checking from number 1\n\n    while polite_count < n:\n        # Check if the current number is not a power of two\n        if not is_power_of_two(number):\n            polite_count += 1  # Increment the polite number counter\n        number += 1  # Move to the next number\n\n    # The loop exits when polite_count reaches n, so the last polite number is number - 1\n    return number - 1\n```\n\nThis code defines a helper function `is_power_of_two` to determine if a number is a power of two. The main function `is_polite` uses this helper to count polite numbers until it reaches the nth one, which it then returns.",
