INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/765 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

The task is to find the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that is not a power of 2. The function should return the nth polite number when given an integer n.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand Polite Numbers**: Polite numbers are all positive integers except those that are powers of 2. For example, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, etc., are polite numbers, while 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., are not.

2. **Generate Polite Numbers**: To find the nth polite number, we need to generate polite numbers in sequence and count them until we reach the nth one.

3. **Check for Powers of 2**: To determine if a number is a power of 2, we can use the property that a number is a power of 2 if it has only one bit set in its binary representation. This can be checked using the condition `(x & (x - 1)) == 0`.

4. **Iterate and Count**: Start from the number 1 and iterate upwards, checking each number to see if it is not a power of 2. Count each polite number until the nth one is found.

## Pseudocode

```
function is_polite(n):
    count = 0
    number = 1
    while count < n:
        if number is not a power of 2:
            increment count
        increment number
    return the last polite number found
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_polite(n: int) -> int:
    def is_power_of_two(x: int) -> bool:
        # A number is a power of two if it has only one bit set in its binary representation
        return (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and x != 0

    count = 0
    number = 1
    while count < n:
        if not is_power_of_two(number):
            count += 1
        number += 1
    
    # The loop exits when count == n, but number has been incremented one extra time
    return number - 1
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Helper Function**: `is_power_of_two(x)` checks if a number is a power of two using bitwise operations.
- **Main Logic**: We initialize `count` to 0 and `number` to 1. We iterate, checking each number to see if it is not a power of two. If it is not, we increment the `count`.
- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until `count` equals `n`, meaning we have found the nth polite number.
- **Return Value**: Since `number` is incremented one extra time after finding the nth polite number, we return `number - 1`.

    ### Language and compiler support

    C++ supports some of those operations since C++20 via the [bit](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/bit) standard library:

    - `has_single_bit`: checks if the number is a power of two
    - `bit_ceil` / `bit_floor`: round up/down to the next power of two
    - `rotl` / `rotr`: rotate the bits in the number
    - `countl_zero` / `countr_zero` / `countl_one` / `countr_one`: count the leading/trailing zeros/ones
    - `popcount`: count the number of set bits

    Additionally, there are also predefined functions in some compilers that help working with bits.
    E.g. GCC defines a list at [Built-in Functions Provided by GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html) that also work in older versions of C++:

    - `__builtin_popcount(unsigned int)` returns the number of set bits (`__builtin_popcount(0b0001'0010'1100) == 4`)
    - `__builtin_ffs(int)` finds the index of the first (most right) set bit (`__builtin_ffs(0b0001'0010'1100) == 3`)
    - `__builtin_clz(unsigned int)` the count of leading zeros (`__builtin_clz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 23`)
    - `__builtin_ctz(unsigned int)` the count of trailing zeros (`__builtin_ctz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 2`)

    _Note that some of the operations (both the C++20 functions and the Compiler Built-in ones) might be quite slow in GCC if you don't enable a specific compiler target with `#pragma GCC target("popcnt")`._

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/765 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that finds the nth polite number. A polite number is a positive integer that is not a power of two. The function should return the nth polite number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the nth polite number, we can iterate through positive integers, checking each one to see if it is a power of two. If it is not a power of two, it is a polite number, and we count it. We continue this process until we have found the nth polite number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a counter for polite numbers found to 0
   Initialize a number to check starting from 1

   While the counter is less than n:
       Check if the current number is a power of two
       If it is not a power of two:
           Increment the polite number counter
       Increment the number to check

   Return the last number checked that was a polite number
   ```
