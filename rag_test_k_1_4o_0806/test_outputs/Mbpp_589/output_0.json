    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that finds all perfect square numbers between two given numbers, inclusive. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Iterate through all integers starting from the square root of the lower bound up to the square root of the upper bound.\n   - For each integer, calculate its square.\n   - If the square is within the given range, add it to the list of perfect squares.\n   - Return the list of perfect squares.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function perfect_squares(a, b):\n       initialize an empty list called squares\n       start = ceiling of the square root of a\n       end = floor of the square root of b\n       for each integer i from start to end (inclusive):\n           calculate square = i * i\n           if square is between a and b (inclusive):\n               add square to squares\n       return squares\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef perfect_squares(a: int, b: int) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store perfect squares\n    squares = []\n    \n    # Calculate the starting point as the ceiling of the square root of a\n    start = int(a**0.5)\n    if start * start < a:\n        start += 1\n    \n    # Calculate the ending point as the floor of the square root of b\n    end = int(b**0.5)\n    \n    # Iterate over each integer from start to end\n    for i in range(start, end + 1):\n        # Calculate the square of the current integer\n        square = i * i\n        # If the square is within the range [a, b], add it to the list\n        if a <= square <= b:\n            squares.append(square)\n    \n    # Return the list of perfect squares\n    return squares\n```\n\nThis code calculates the perfect squares between two numbers by iterating over the possible integer roots and checking if their squares fall within the specified range.",
