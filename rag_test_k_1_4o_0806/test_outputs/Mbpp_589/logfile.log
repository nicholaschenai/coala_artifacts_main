INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/589 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that finds all perfect squares between two given numbers, inclusive. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 are perfect squares because they are 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, and 5^2, respectively.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Range**: We are given two numbers, `start` and `end`. We need to find all perfect squares between these two numbers, inclusive.
2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to `start` and continue until the square of the integer is less than or equal to `end`.
3. **Collect Perfect Squares**: For each integer in this range, calculate its square and add it to the list of perfect squares if it falls within the range `[start, end]`.
4. **Return the List**: Return the list of perfect squares found.

## Pseudocode

```
function perfect_squares(start, end):
    initialize an empty list called squares
    initialize i to 1
    while i * i is less than or equal to end:
        if i * i is greater than or equal to start:
            add i * i to squares
        increment i by 1
    return squares
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def perfect_squares(start: int, end: int) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store perfect squares
    squares = []
    
    # Start with the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to start
    i = 1
    
    # Continue while the square of i is within the range
    while i * i <= end:
        # Check if the square of i is within the range [start, end]
        if i * i >= start:
            # Add the square to the list
            squares.append(i * i)
        # Move to the next integer
        i += 1
    
    # Return the list of perfect squares
    return squares
```

This solution iterates over integers starting from 1, checking if their squares fall within the specified range, and collects those that do. The loop stops when the square of the integer exceeds the `end` value.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }
