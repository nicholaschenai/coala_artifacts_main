    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that finds the position in a sorted list where a given value can be inserted while maintaining the list's sorted order. This position is known as the \"left insertion point,\" which is the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the specified value.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Since the list is sorted, we can use a binary search approach to efficiently find the left insertion point. The idea is to repeatedly divide the list into halves and determine which half the target value belongs to, until we narrow down the exact position where the value can be inserted.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function left_insertion(arr, x):\n       Initialize low to 0\n       Initialize high to length of arr\n       \n       While low is less than high:\n           Calculate mid as the average of low and high\n           If arr[mid] is less than x:\n               Set low to mid + 1\n           Else:\n               Set high to mid\n       \n       Return low\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef left_insertion(arr, x):\n    # Initialize the low and high pointers\n    low, high = 0, len(arr)\n    \n    # Perform binary search\n    while low < high:\n        # Calculate the middle index\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        \n        # If the middle element is less than x, move the low pointer up\n        if arr[mid] < x:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, move the high pointer down\n            high = mid\n    \n    # Return the low pointer, which is the left insertion point\n    return low\n```\n\nThis function uses a binary search approach to find the left insertion point in a sorted list, ensuring an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(log n).",
