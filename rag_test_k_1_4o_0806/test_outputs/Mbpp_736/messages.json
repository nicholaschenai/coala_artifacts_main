This position should be the leftmost position where the value can be inserted.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate through the list from the beginning to the end.\n   - For each element in the list, we will check if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value.\n   - If we find such an element, the current index is the left insertion point for the specified value.\n   - If we reach the end of the list without finding such an element, the insertion point is at the end of the list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function left_insertion(sorted_list, value):\n       for index from 0 to length of sorted_list - 1:\n           if sorted_list[index] >= value:\n               return index\n       return length of sorted_list\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef left_insertion(sorted_list, value):\n    # Iterate over each index and element in the sorted list\n    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):\n        # If the current element is greater than or equal to the value\n        if sorted_list[index] >= value:\n            # Return the current index as the insertion point\n            return index\n    # If no such element is found, return the length of the list\n    # indicating the value should be inserted at the end\n    return len(sorted_list)\n```\n\nThis function will correctly find the leftmost insertion point for a given value in a sorted list."

i < n; i++) {\n        if (array[i] == x) {\n            // x found at index i\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$,\n    because in the worst case, it is necessary to check\n    all elements of the array.\n    If the order of the elements is arbitrary,\n    this is also the best possible approach, because\n    there is no additional information available where\n    in the array we should search for the element $x$.\n\n    However, if the array is \\emph{sorted},\n    the situation is different.\n    In this case it is possible to perform the\n    search much faster, because the order of the\n    elements in the array guides the search.\n    The following \\key{binary search} algorithm\n    efficiently searches for an element in a sorted array\n    in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Method 1}\n\n    The usual way to implement binary search\n    resembles looking for a word in a dictionary.\n    The search maintains an active region in the array,\n    which initially contains all array elements.\n    Then, a number of steps is performed,\n    each of which halves the size of the region.\n\n    At each step, the search checks the middle element\n    of the active region.\n    If the middle element is the target element,\n    the search terminates.\n    Otherwise, the search recursively continues\n    to the left or right half of the region,\n    depending on the value of the middle element.\n\n    The above idea can be implemented as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int a = 0, b = n-1;\n    while (a <= b) {\n        int k = (a+b)/2;\n        if (array[k] == x) {\n            // x found at index k\n        }\n        if (array[k] > x) b = k-1;\n        else a = k+1;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    In this implementation, the active region is $a \\ldots b$,\n    and initially the region is $0 \\ldots n-1$.\n    The algorithm halves the size of the region at each step,\n    so the time complexity is $O(\\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Method 2}\n\n    An alternative method to implement binary search\n    is based on an efficient way to iterate through\n    the elements of the array.\n    The idea is to make jumps and slow the speed\n    when we get closer to the target element.\n\n    The search goes through the array from left to\n    right, and the initial jump length is $n/2$.\n    At each step, the jump length will be halved:\n    first $n/4$, then $n/8$, $n/16$, etc., until\n    finally the length is 1.\n    After the jumps, either the target element has\n    been found or we know that it does not appear in the array.\n\n    The following code implements the above idea:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int k = 0;\n    for (int b = n/2; b >= 1; b /= 2) {\n        while (k+b < n && array[k+b] <= x) k += b;\n    }\n    if (array[k] == x) {\n        // x found at index k\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    During the search, the variable $b$\n    contains the current jump length.\n    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(\\log n)$,\n    because the code in the \\texttt{while} loop\n    is performed at most twice for each jump length.\n\n    \\subsubsection{C++ functions}\n\n    The C++ standard library contains the following functions\n    that are based on binary search and work in logarithmic time:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\texttt{lower\\_bound} returns a pointer to the\n    first array element whose value is at least $x$.\n    \\item \\texttt{upper\\_bound} returns a pointer to the\n    first array element whose value is larger than $x$.\n    \\item \\texttt{equal\\_range} returns both above pointers.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    The functions assume that the array is sorted.\n    If there is no such element, the pointer points to\n    the element after the last array element.\n    For example, the following code finds out whether\n    an array contains an element with value $x$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    auto k = lower_bound(array,array+n,x)-array;\n    if (k < n && array[k] == x) {\n        // x found at index k\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Then, the following code counts the number of elements\n    whose value is $x$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    auto a = lower_bound(array, array+n, x);\n    auto b = upper_bound(array, array+n, x);\n    cout << b-a << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Using \\texttt{equal\\_range}, the code becomes shorter:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    auto r = equal_range(array, array+n, x);\n    cout << r.second-r.first << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Finding the smallest solution}\n\n    An important use for binary search is\n    to find the position where the value of a \\emph{function} changes.\n    Suppose that we wish to find the smallest value $k$\n    that is a valid solution for a problem.\n    We are given a function $\\texttt{ok}(x)$\n    that returns \\texttt{true} if $x$ is a valid solution\n    and \\texttt{false} otherwise.\n    In addition, we know that $\\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \\texttt{false}\n    when $x<k$ and \\texttt{true} when $x \\ge k$.\n    The situation looks as follows:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrr}\n    $x$ & 0 & 1 & $\\cdots$ & $k-1$ & $k$ & $k+1$ & $\\cdots$ \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $\\texttt{ok}(x)$ & \\texttt{false} & \\texttt{false}\n    & $\\cdots$ & \\texttt{false} & \\texttt{true} & \\texttt{true} & $\\cdots$ \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\noindent\n    Now, the value of $k$ can be found using binary search:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int x = -1;\n    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {\n        while (!ok(x+b)) x += b;\n    }\n    int k = x+1;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The search finds the largest value of $x$ for which\n    $\\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \\texttt{false}.\n    Thus, the next value $k=x+1$\n    is the smallest possible value for which\n    $\\texttt{ok}(k)$ is \\texttt{true}.\n    The initial jump length $z$ has to be\n    large enough, for example some value\n    for which we know beforehand that $\\texttt{ok}(z)$ is \\texttt{true}.\n\n    The algorithm calls the function \\texttt{ok}\n    $O(\\log z)$ times, so the total time complexity\n    depends on the function \\texttt{ok}.\n    For example, if the function works in $O(n)$ time,\n    the total time complexity is $O(n \\log z)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Finding the maximum value}\n\n    Binary search can also be used to find\n    the maximum value for a function that is\n    first increasing and then decreasing.\n    Our task is to find a position $k$ such that\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item\n    $f(x)<f(x+1)$ when $x<k$, and\n    \\item\n    $f(x)>f(x+1)$ when $x \\ge k$.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    The idea is to use binary search\n    for finding the largest value of $x$\n    for which $f(x)<f(x+1)$.\n    This implies that $k=x+1$\n    because $f(x+1)>f(x+2)$.\n    The following code implements the search: \n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int x = -1;\n    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {\n        while (f(x+b) < f(x+b+1)) x += b;\n    }\n    int k = x+1;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Note that unlike in the ordinary binary search,\n    here it is not allowed that consecutive values\n    of the function are equal.\n    In this case it would not be possible to know\n    how to continue the search.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
