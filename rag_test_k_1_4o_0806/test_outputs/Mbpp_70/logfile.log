INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/70 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if all the tuples in a given list have the same length. If all tuples have the same length, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Extract Lengths**: First, we will extract the length of each tuple in the list.
2. **Check Uniformity**: We will then check if all these lengths are the same.
3. **Return Result**: If all lengths are equal, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `get_equal` that takes a list of tuples as input.
2. If the list is empty, return `True` because there are no tuples to compare.
3. Extract the length of the first tuple and store it in a variable `first_length`.
4. Iterate over each tuple in the list:
   - If the length of the current tuple is not equal to `first_length`, return `False`.
5. If the loop completes without returning `False`, return `True`.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def get_equal(tuples: list) -> bool:
    # If the list is empty, all tuples (none) have the same length by default
    if not tuples:
        return True
    
    # Get the length of the first tuple
    first_length = len(tuples[0])
    
    # Check if all tuples have the same length as the first one
    for t in tuples:
        if len(t) != first_length:
            return False
    
    # If all tuples have the same length, return True
    return True
```

This solution iterates through the list of tuples, comparing each tuple's length to the first tuple's length. If any tuple has a different length, it returns `False`. If all tuples have the same length, it returns `True`.

    Title: Length of the union of segments
    Part: 1/1
    # Length of the union of segments

    Given $n$ segments on a line, each described by a pair of coordinates $(a_{i1}, a_{i2})$.
    We have to find the length of their union.

    The following algorithm was proposed by Klee in 1977.
    It works in $O(n\log n)$ and has been proven to be the asymptotically optimal.

    ## Solution

    We store in an array $x$ the endpoints of all the segments sorted by their values.
    And additionally we store whether it is a left end or a right end of a segment.
    Now we iterate over the array, keeping a counter $c$ of currently opened segments.
    Whenever the current element is a left end, we increase this counter, and otherwise we decrease it.
    To compute the answer, we take the length between the last to $x$ values $x_i - x_{i-1}$, whenever we come to a new coordinate, and there is currently at least one segment is open.

    ## Implementation

    ```cpp
    int length_union(const vector<pair<int, int>> &a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<pair<int, bool>> x(n*2);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            x[i*2] = {a[i].first, false};
            x[i*2+1] = {a[i].second, true};
        }

        sort(x.begin(), x.end());

        int result = 0;
        int c = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n * 2; i++) {
            if (i > 0 && x[i].first > x[i-1].first && c > 0)
                result += x[i].first - x[i-1].first;
            if (x[i].second)
                c--;
            else
                c++;
        }
        return result;
    }
    ```
