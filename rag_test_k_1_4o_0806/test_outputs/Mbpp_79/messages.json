If the length is odd, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, determine the length of the input word.\n   - Check if this length is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the length modulo 2 is not equal to zero, then the length is odd.\n   - Return `True` if the length is odd, otherwise return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function word_len(word):\n       length = length of the word\n       if length % 2 is not equal to 0:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef word_len(word: str) -> bool:\n    # Calculate the length of the word\n    length = len(word)\n    \n    # Check if the length is odd\n    if length % 2 != 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function `word_len` takes a string `word` as input, calculates its length, and checks if the length is odd. If the length is odd, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`."
