INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/79 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if the length of a given word is odd. If the length is odd, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, determine the length of the input word.
   - Check if this length is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the length modulo 2 is not equal to zero, then the length is odd.
   - Return `True` if the length is odd, otherwise return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function word_len(word):
       length = length of the word
       if length % 2 is not equal to 0:
           return True
       else:
           return False
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def word_len(word: str) -> bool:
    # Calculate the length of the word
    length = len(word)
    
    # Check if the length is odd
    if length % 2 != 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function `word_len` takes a string `word` as input, calculates its length, and checks if the length is odd. If the length is odd, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

   We need to create a function that checks if the length of a given word is odd. If the length is odd, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To determine if the length of a word is odd, we can:
   - Calculate the length of the word using Python's built-in `len()` function.
   - Check if this length is odd by using the modulus operator `%`. If `length % 2` equals 1, the length is odd.
   - Return `True` if the length is odd, otherwise return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function word_len(word):
       Calculate the length of the word using len(word)
       Check if the length is odd by using modulus operator: length % 2
       If the result is 1, return True
       Otherwise, return False
   ```

    length = len(word)
    # Check if the length is odd
    # If length % 2 equals 1, it is odd
    return length % 2 == 1
```

This function will correctly determine if the length of the input word is odd and return the appropriate boolean value.
