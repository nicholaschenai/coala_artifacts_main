INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/633 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the XOR of all unique pairs of numbers in a given list. The function should take a list of integers and the length of the list as inputs, and return the sum of the XOR values for all possible pairs.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand XOR Operation**: XOR (exclusive or) is a binary operation that takes two bits and returns 1 if the bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. For integers, XOR is applied bitwise.

2. **Identify Pairs**: For a list of `n` numbers, we need to consider all unique pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.

3. **Calculate XOR for Each Pair**: For each pair `(i, j)`, compute the XOR of the two numbers.

4. **Sum the XOR Values**: Accumulate the XOR values for all pairs to get the final result.

### Pseudocode

```
function pair_xor_Sum(arr, n):
    initialize sum_xor to 0
    for i from 0 to n-1:
        for j from i+1 to n-1:
            compute xor_value as arr[i] XOR arr[j]
            add xor_value to sum_xor
    return sum_xor
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def pair_xor_Sum(arr, n):
    # Initialize the sum of XORs to zero
    sum_xor = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for i in range(n):
        # For each element, iterate over the elements that come after it
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Calculate the XOR of the current pair
            xor_value = arr[i] ^ arr[j]
            # Add the XOR value to the total sum
            sum_xor += xor_value
    
    # Return the total sum of XORs
    return sum_xor
```

This solution iterates over all unique pairs of elements in the list, calculates their XOR, and accumulates the result. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, which is efficient enough for moderate-sized lists.

    $ steps.

    Note that it is possible to solve the problem
    in another way in $O(n \log n)$ time using binary search.
    In such a solution, we iterate through the array
    and for each array value, we try to find another
    value that yields the sum $x$.
    This can be done by performing $n$ binary searches,
    each of which takes $O(\log n)$ time.

    \index{3SUM problem}
    A more difficult problem is 
    the \key{3SUM problem} that asks to
    find \emph{three} array values
    whose sum is $x$.
    Using the idea of the above algorithm,
    this problem can be solved in $O(n^2)$ time\footnote{For a long time,
    it was thought that solving
    the 3SUM problem more efficiently than in $O(n^2)$ time
    would not be possible.
    However, in 2014, it turned out \cite{gro14}
    that this is not the case.}.
    Can you see how?

   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and its length as input, and returns the sum of the XOR of all possible pairs of numbers from the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to consider all possible pairs of numbers from the list. For each pair, we calculate the XOR of the two numbers and add this result to a running total. We continue this process until all pairs have been considered. The final total will be the sum of the XORs of all pairs.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a variable `total_xor_sum` to 0
   For each index `i` from 0 to n-1:
       For each index `j` from i+1 to n-1:
           Calculate the XOR of the elements at index `i` and `j`
           Add the result to `total_xor_sum`
   Return `total_xor_sum`
   ```
