    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the position in a sorted list where a given value can be inserted such that the list remains sorted. The position should be the rightmost possible index where the value can be inserted.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Since the list is sorted, we can use a binary search approach to efficiently find the right insertion point. The idea is to repeatedly divide the list into halves and determine which half the value should be inserted into. We continue this process until we find the correct position where the value can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize two pointers, left and right, to the start and end of the list.\n   While left is less than or equal to right:\n       Calculate the middle index.\n       If the value at the middle index is less than or equal to the target value:\n           Move the left pointer to the middle index + 1.\n       Else:\n           Move the right pointer to the middle index - 1.\n   The left pointer will be at the correct insertion point.\n   Return the left pointer.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef right_insertion(arr, value):\n    # Initialize the left and right pointers\n    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1\n    \n    # Perform binary search\n    while left <= right:\n        # Calculate the middle index\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        \n        # If the middle element is less than or equal to the value\n        if arr[mid] <= value:\n            # Move the left pointer to mid + 1\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            # Move the right pointer to mid - 1\n            right = mid - 1\n    \n    # The left pointer is now at the right insertion point\n    return left\n```\n\nThis code uses a binary search approach to find the rightmost insertion point for a given value in a sorted list. The `left` pointer will end up at the correct position where the value can be inserted to maintain the sorted order.",
