    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that determines if a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if a number is prime, we can use the trial division method. This involves checking if the number is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of the number. If it is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime. We also need to handle special cases: numbers less than 2 are not prime, and 2 is the only even prime number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function prime_num(n):\n       If n is less than 2:\n           Return False\n       If n is 2:\n           Return True\n       If n is even:\n           Return False\n       For each number i from 3 to the square root of n, incrementing by 2:\n           If n is divisible by i:\n               Return False\n       Return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef prime_num(n: int) -> bool:\n    # If the number is less than 2, it is not prime\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    # 2 is the only even prime number\n    if n == 2:\n        return True\n    # If the number is even and greater than 2, it is not prime\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    # Check for factors from 3 to the square root of n, only odd numbers\n    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    # If no factors were found, the number is prime\n    return True\n```",
