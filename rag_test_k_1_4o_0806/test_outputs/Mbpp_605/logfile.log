INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/605 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to write a function that determines whether a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To determine if a number is prime:
- If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
- If the number is 2, it is prime because 2 is the smallest and only even prime number.
- For numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.
- If no divisors are found, the number is prime.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function prime_num(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n is even:
        return False
    for i from 3 to sqrt(n) with step 2:
        if n is divisible by i:
            return False
    return True
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def prime_num(n: int) -> bool:
    # If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    # 2 is the only even prime number
    if n == 2:
        return True
    # If the number is even and greater than 2, it is not prime
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    # Check for factors from 3 to the square root of n
    # Only check odd numbers since even numbers are not prime
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    # If no factors were found, the number is prime
    return True
```

This function efficiently checks if a number is prime by reducing the number of potential divisors it needs to check, leveraging the properties of prime numbers.

    Title: Primality tests
    Part: 1/2
    # Primality tests

    This article describes multiple algorithms to determine if a number is prime or not.

    ## Trial division

    By definition a prime number doesn't have any divisors other than $1$ and itself.
    A composite number has at least one additional divisor, let's call it $d$.
    Naturally $\frac{n}{d}$ is also a divisor of $n$.
    It's easy to see, that either $d \le \sqrt{n}$ or $\frac{n}{d} \le \sqrt{n}$, therefore one of the divisors $d$ and $\frac{n}{d}$ is $\le \sqrt{n}$.
    We can use this information to check for primality.

    We try to find a non-trivial divisor, by checking if any of the numbers between $2$ and $\sqrt{n}$ is a divisor of $n$.
    If it is a divisor, than $n$ is definitely not prime, otherwise it is.

    ```cpp
    bool isPrime(int x) {
        for (int d = 2; d * d <= x; d++) {
            if (x % d == 0)
                return false;
        }
        return x >= 2;
    }
    ```

    This is the simplest form of a prime check.
    You can optimize this function quite a bit, for instance by only checking all odd numbers in the loop, since the only even prime number is 2.
    Multiple such optimizations are described in the article about [integer factorization](factorization.md).

    ## Fermat primality test

    This is a probabilistic test.

    Fermat's little theorem (see also [Euler's totient function](phi-function.md)) states, that for a prime number $p$ and a coprime integer $a$ the following equation holds:

    $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p$$

    In general this theorem doesn't hold for composite numbers.

    This can be used to create a primality test.
    We pick an integer $2 \le a \le p - 2$, and check if the equation holds or not.
    If it doesn't hold, e.g. $a^{p-1} \not\equiv 1 \bmod p$, we know that $p$ cannot be a prime number.
    In this case we call the base $a$ a *Fermat witness* for the compositeness of $p$.

    However it is also possible, that the equation holds for a composite number.
    So if the equation holds, we don't have a proof for primality.
    We only can say that $p$ is *probably prime*.
    If it turns out that the number is actually composite, we call the base $a$ a *Fermat liar*.

    By running the test for all possible bases $a$, we can actually prove that a number is prime.
    However this is not done in practice, since this is a lot more effort that just doing *trial division*.
    Instead the test will be repeated multiple times with random choices for $a$.
    If we find no witness for the compositeness, it is very likely that the number is in fact prime.

    ```cpp
    bool probablyPrimeFermat(int n, int iter=5) {
        if (n < 4)
            return n == 2 || n == 3;

        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {
            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);
            if (binpower(a, n - 1, n) != 1)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    ```

    We use [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md) to efficiently compute the power $a^{p-1}$.

    There is one bad news though:
    there exist some composite numbers where $a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \bmod n$ holds for all $a$ coprime to $n$, for instance for the number $561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17$.
    Such numbers are called *Carmichael numbers*.
    The Fermat primality test can identify these numbers only, if we have immense luck and choose a base $a$ with $\gcd(a, n) \ne 1$.

    The Fermat test is still be used in practice, as it is very fast and Carmichael numbers are very rare.
    E.g. there only exist 646 such numbers below $10^9$.

    ## Miller-Rabin primality test

    The Miller-Rabin test extends the ideas from the Fermat test.

    For an odd number $n$, $n-1$ is even and we can factor out all powers of 2.
    We can write:

    $$n - 1 = 2^s \cdot d,~\text{with}~d~\text{odd}.$$

    This allows us to factorize the equation of Fermat's little theorem:

    $$\begin{array}{rl}
    a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \bmod n &\Longleftrightarrow a^{2^s d} - 1 \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-1} d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\quad\vdots \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) \cdots (a^{d} + 1) (a^{d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    \end{array}$$

    If $n$ is prime, then $n$ has to divide one of these factors.
    And in the Miller-Rabin primality test we check exactly that statement, which is a more stricter version of the statement of the Fermat test.
    For a base $2 \le a \le n-2$ we check if either

    $$a^d \equiv 1 \bmod n$$

    holds or

    $$a^{2^r d} \equiv -1 \bmod n$$

    holds for some $0 \le r \le s - 1$.

    If we found a base $a$ which doesn't satisfy any of the above equalities, than we found a *witness* for the compositeness of $n$.
    In this case we have proven that $n$ is not a prime number.

    Similar to the Fermat test, it is also possible that the set of equations is satisfied for a composite number.
    In that case the base $a$ is called a *strong liar*.
    If a base $a$ satisfies the equations (one of them), $n$ is only *strong probable prime*.
    However, there are no numbers like the Carmichael numbers, where all non-trivial bases lie.
    In fact it is possible to show, that at most $\frac{1}{4}$ of the bases can be strong liars.
    If $n$ is composite, we have a probability of $\ge 75\%$ that a random base will tell us that it is composite.
    By doing multiple iterations, choosing different random bases, we can tell with very high probability if the number is truly prime or if it is composite.

    Here is an implementation for 64 bit integer.

    ```cpp
    using u64 = uint64_t;
    using u128 = __uint128_t;

    u64 binpower(u64 base, u64 e, u64 mod) {
        u64 result = 1;
        base %= mod;
        while (e) {
            if (e & 1)
                result = (u128)result * base % mod;
            base = (u128)base * base % mod;
            e >>= 1;
        }
        return result;
    }

    bool check_composite(u64 n, u64 a, u64 d, int s) {
        u64 x = binpower(a, d, n);
        if (x == 1 || x == n - 1)
            return false;
        for (int r = 1; r < s; r++) {
            x = (u128)x * x % n;
            if (x == n - 1)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    };

    bool MillerRabin(u64 n, int iter=5) { // returns true if n is probably prime, else returns false.
        if (n < 4)
            return n == 2 || n == 3;

        int s = 0;
        u64 d = n - 1;
        while ((d & 1) == 0) {
            d >>= 1;
            s++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {
            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);
            if (check_composite(n, a, d, s))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    ```

    Before the Miller-Rabin test you can test additionally if one of the first few prime numbers is a divisor.
    This can speed up the test by a lot, since most composite numbers have very small prime divisors.
    E.g. $88\%$ of all numbers have a prime factors smaller than $100$.

    ### Deterministic version

    Miller showed that it is possible to make the algorithm deterministic by only checking all bases $\le O((\ln n)^2)$.
    Bach later gave a concrete bound, it is only necessary to test all bases $a \le 2 \ln(n)^2$.

    This is still a pretty large number of bases.
    So people have invested quite a lot of computation power into finding lower bounds.
    It turns out, for testing a 32 bit integer it is only necessary to check the first 4 prime bases: 2, 3, 5 and 7.
    The smallest composite number that fails this test is $3,215,031,751 = 151 \cdot 751 \cdot 28351$.
    And for testing 64 bit integer it is enough to check the first 12 prime bases: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.

    This results in the following deterministic implementation:

    ```cpp
    bool MillerRabin(u64 n) { // returns true if n is prime, else returns false.
        if (n < 2)
            return false;

        int r = 0;
        u64 d = n - 1;
        while ((d & 1) == 0) {
            d >>= 1;
            r++;
        }

        for (int a : {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37}) {
            if (n == a)
                return true;
            if (check_composite(n, a, d, r))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
