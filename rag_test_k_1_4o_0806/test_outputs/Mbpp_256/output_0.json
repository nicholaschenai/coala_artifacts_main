    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the count of prime numbers that are less than this input number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to identify all prime numbers less than the given number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We can iterate through all numbers less than the given number and check if each is prime. To check if a number is prime, we can test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime. We will count all such prime numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function is_prime(n):\n       If n is less than 2, return False\n       For i from 2 to square root of n:\n           If n is divisible by i, return False\n       Return True\n\n   Function count_Primes_nums(num):\n       Initialize count to 0\n       For each number i from 2 to num - 1:\n           If is_prime(i) is True:\n               Increment count by 1\n       Return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    # A number less than 2 is not prime\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    # Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of n\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef count_Primes_nums(num: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the count of prime numbers\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate over each number from 2 to num - 1\n    for i in range(2, num):\n        # Check if the number is prime\n        if is_prime(i):\n            # Increment the count if it is prime\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of prime numbers\n    return count\n```\n\nThis code defines a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime and uses it in the main function `count_Primes_nums` to count all prime numbers less than the given input.",
