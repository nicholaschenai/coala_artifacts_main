INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/256 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the count of prime numbers that are less than this input number.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - To find the number of prime numbers less than a given number `n`, we can iterate through all numbers from 2 to `n-1` and check if each number is prime.
   - To check if a number `k` is prime, we can test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `k`. If `k` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.
   - Count each prime number found and return the total count.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function is_prime(number):
       If number is less than 2, return False
       For each integer i from 2 to the square root of number:
           If number is divisible by i, return False
       Return True

   Define function count_Primes_nums(n):
       Initialize prime_count to 0
       For each integer num from 2 to n-1:
           If is_prime(num) is True:
               Increment prime_count by 1
       Return prime_count
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_prime(number: int) -> bool:
    # A number less than 2 is not prime
    if number < 2:
        return False
    # Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number
    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_Primes_nums(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the count of prime numbers
    prime_count = 0
    # Iterate over each number from 2 to n-1
    for num in range(2, n):
        # Check if the current number is prime
        if is_prime(num):
            # Increment the prime count if it is prime
            prime_count += 1
    # Return the total count of prime numbers found
    return prime_count
```

This solution defines a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime and uses it within the main function `count_Primes_nums` to count all prime numbers less than the given input `n`.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }
