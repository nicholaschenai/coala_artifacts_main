INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/784 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and finds the product of the first even number and the first odd number in the list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the First Odd and Even Numbers**: Traverse the list from the beginning. Keep track of the first even number and the first odd number encountered.
2. **Calculate the Product**: Once both the first even and the first odd numbers are found, calculate their product.
3. **Return the Product**: Return the product as the result.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize two variables, `first_even` and `first_odd`, to `None`.
2. Loop through each number in the list:
   - If `first_even` is `None` and the number is even, set `first_even` to this number.
   - If `first_odd` is `None` and the number is odd, set `first_odd` to this number.
   - If both `first_even` and `first_odd` are not `None`, break the loop.
3. Calculate the product of `first_even` and `first_odd`.
4. Return the product.

### Python Code

```python
def mul_even_odd(lst):
    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers
    first_even = None
    first_odd = None
    
    # Iterate over the list to find the first even and odd numbers
    for num in lst:
        # Check if the number is even and first_even is not yet set
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        # Check if the number is odd and first_odd is not yet set
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        # If both first_even and first_odd are found, break the loop
        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:
            break
    
    # Calculate and return the product of the first even and odd numbers
    return first_even * first_odd
```

This code will correctly find the first even and odd numbers in the list and return their product, as required by the problem statement.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
