    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and finds the product of the first even number and the first odd number in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Iterate through the list of numbers.\n   - Keep track of whether we have found the first even number and the first odd number.\n   - If a number is even and we haven't found an even number yet, store it as the first even number.\n   - If a number is odd and we haven't found an odd number yet, store it as the first odd number.\n   - Once both the first even and the first odd numbers are found, calculate their product.\n   - Return the product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function mul_even_odd(numbers):\n       initialize first_even as None\n       initialize first_odd as None\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even and first_even is None:\n               set first_even to number\n           if number is odd and first_odd is None:\n               set first_odd to number\n           if both first_even and first_odd are not None:\n               break the loop\n       \n       return the product of first_even and first_odd\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef mul_even_odd(numbers):\n    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers\n    first_even = None\n    first_odd = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of numbers\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even and we haven't found an even number yet\n        if number % 2 == 0 and first_even is None:\n            first_even = number\n        # Check if the number is odd and we haven't found an odd number yet\n        if number % 2 != 0 and first_odd is None:\n            first_odd = number\n        # If both first even and odd numbers are found, break the loop\n        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # Return the product of the first even and odd numbers\n    return first_even * first_odd\n```",
