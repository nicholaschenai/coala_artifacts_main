        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of integers and finds the product of the first even number and the first odd number in the list.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the First Odd and Even Numbers**: Traverse the list from the beginning. Keep track of the first even number and the first odd number encountered.\n2. **Calculate the Product**: Once both the first even and the first odd numbers are found, calculate their product.\n3. **Return the Product**: Return the product as the result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize two variables, `first_even` and `first_odd`, to `None`.\n2. Loop through each number in the list:\n   - If `first_even` is `None` and the number is even, set `first_even` to this number.\n   - If `first_odd` is `None` and the number is odd, set `first_odd` to this number.\n   - If both `first_even` and `first_odd` are not `None`, break the loop.\n3. Calculate the product of `first_even` and `first_odd`.\n4. Return the product.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef mul_even_odd(lst):\n    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers\n    first_even = None\n    first_odd = None\n    \n    # Iterate over the list to find the first even and odd numbers\n    for num in lst:\n        # Check if the number is even and first_even is not yet set\n        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:\n            first_even = num\n        # Check if the number is odd and first_odd is not yet set\n        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:\n            first_odd = num\n        # If both first_even and first_odd are found, break the loop\n        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # Calculate and return the product of the first even and odd numbers\n    return first_even * first_odd\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find the first even and odd numbers in the list and return their product, as required by the problem statement."
