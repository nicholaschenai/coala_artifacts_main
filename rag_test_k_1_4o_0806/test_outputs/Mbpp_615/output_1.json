    "raw_msg": "Let's revisit the problem and ensure the solution is correct. The task is to calculate the average of each inner tuple in a tuple of tuples and return these averages as a list. The previous solution should be correct, but let's ensure it is implemented properly and re-evaluate it.\n\nHere's the corrected and final solution:\n\n```python\ndef average_tuple(input_tuple_of_tuples):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the averages\n    averages = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the input tuple of tuples\n    for t in input_tuple_of_tuples:\n        # Calculate the sum of the elements in the tuple\n        total = sum(t)\n        # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements\n        average = total / len(t)\n        # Append the average to the averages list\n        averages.append(average)\n    \n    # Return the list of averages\n    return averages\n```\n\nThis code iterates over each inner tuple, calculates the sum of its elements, divides by the number of elements to get the average, and appends the result to the list of averages. The function then returns this list. This should correctly solve the problem as described.",
