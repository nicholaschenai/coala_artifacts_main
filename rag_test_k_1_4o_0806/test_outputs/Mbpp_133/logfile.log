INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/133 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the negative numbers in that list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of negative numbers.
   - Iterate through each number in the list.
   - Check if the current number is negative.
   - If it is negative, add it to the sum.
   - After iterating through the list, return the sum of the negative numbers.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_negativenum(numbers):
       initialize sum_of_negatives to 0
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is less than 0:
               add number to sum_of_negatives
       return sum_of_negatives
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_negativenum(numbers):
    # Initialize the sum of negative numbers to 0
    sum_of_negatives = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is negative
        if number < 0:
            # Add the negative number to the sum
            sum_of_negatives += number
    
    # Return the total sum of negative numbers
    return sum_of_negatives
```

This function will correctly calculate the sum of all negative numbers in a given list, as required by the problem statement.

    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Minimizing sums
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/133 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and calculates the sum of all the negative numbers in that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the list. For each number, we will check if it is negative. If it is, we will add it to a running total (initialized to zero). After checking all the numbers, the running total will be the sum of all negative numbers in the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a variable `sum_negatives` to 0
   For each number `num` in the list:
       If `num` is less than 0:
           Add `num` to `sum_negatives`
   Return `sum_negatives`
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_negativenum(numbers):
    # Initialize the sum of negative numbers to 0
    sum_negatives = 0
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for num in numbers:

        if num < 0:

            sum_negatives += num
    
    # Return the total sum of negative numbers
