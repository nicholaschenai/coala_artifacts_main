    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius. If the radius is negative, the function should return `None`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle with its hypotenuse as the diameter of the semicircle. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\). In this case, the base and height are both equal to the radius of the semicircle. Therefore, the area of the largest inscribed triangle is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times r \\times r = \\frac{r^2}{2} \\).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function triangle_area(radius):\n       If radius is less than 0:\n           Return None\n       Else:\n           Calculate area as (radius^2) / 2\n           Return area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef triangle_area(radius: float) -> float:\n    # If the radius is negative, return None as a triangle cannot be inscribed\n    if radius < 0:\n        return None\n    # Calculate the area of the largest inscribed triangle\n    # The largest triangle is a right triangle with both legs equal to the radius\n    # Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * radius * radius = radius^2 / 2\n    area = (radius ** 2) / 2\n    return area\n```",
