INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/626 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with a given radius. If the radius is negative, the function should return `None`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Geometry**: 
   - A semicircle is half of a circle. The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle with its hypotenuse as the diameter of the semicircle.
   - The diameter of the semicircle is twice the radius (`2 * radius`).

2. **Triangle Properties**:
   - For a right triangle inscribed in a semicircle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the semicircle.
   - The maximum area of such a triangle is achieved when the triangle is isosceles, meaning the two legs are equal in length.

3. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of a triangle is given by the formula: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
   - For the largest inscribed triangle, the base and height are both equal to the radius of the semicircle.
   - Therefore, the area of the largest triangle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{radius} \times \text{radius} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{radius}^2 \).

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the radius is negative, the function should return `None` because a negative radius does not make sense in this context.

## Pseudocode

```
function triangle_area(radius):
    if radius is negative:
        return None
    else:
        calculate area as (1/2) * radius * radius
        return the calculated area
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def triangle_area(radius: float) -> float:
    # If the radius is negative, return None
    if radius < 0:
        return None
    # Calculate the area of the largest inscribed triangle
    # Area = (1/2) * radius * radius
    area = 0.5 * radius * radius
    return area
```

    Title: Circle-Circle Intersection
    Part: 1/1
    # Circle-Circle Intersection

    You are given two circles on a 2D plane, each one described as coordinates of its center and its radius. Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).

    ## Solution

    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).

    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$

    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$x \cdot (-2x_2) + y \cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$

    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:

    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$

    $$\begin{align}
    A &= -2x_2 \\
    B &= -2y_2 \\
    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2
    \end{align}$$

    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).

    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.
