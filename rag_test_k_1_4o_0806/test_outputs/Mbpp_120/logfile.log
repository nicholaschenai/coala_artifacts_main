INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/120 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two numbers. The function should calculate the product of the two numbers in each tuple, find the absolute value of each product, and then return the maximum absolute product from all the tuples.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum absolute product found so far.
2. Iterate over each tuple in the list.
3. For each tuple, calculate the product of the two numbers.
4. Take the absolute value of the product.
5. Compare this absolute product with the current maximum absolute product and update the maximum if this one is larger.
6. After iterating through all tuples, return the maximum absolute product found.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_product_tuple(list_of_tuples):
    max_abs_product = 0
    for each tuple in list_of_tuples:
        product = first element of tuple * second element of tuple
        abs_product = absolute value of product
        if abs_product > max_abs_product:
            max_abs_product = abs_product
    return max_abs_product
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def max_product_tuple(list_of_tuples):
    # Initialize the maximum absolute product to zero
    max_abs_product = 0
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for t in list_of_tuples:
        # Calculate the product of the two numbers in the tuple
        product = t[0] * t[1]
        
        # Calculate the absolute value of the product
        abs_product = abs(product)
        
        # Update the maximum absolute product if the current one is larger
        if abs_product > max_abs_product:
            max_abs_product = abs_product
    
    # Return the maximum absolute product found
    return max_abs_product
```

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
