INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/427 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a date string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" and converts it to the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The input is a string representing a date in the format "yyyy-mm-dd".
   - We need to split this string into its components: year, month, and day.
   - Rearrange these components to form a new string in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".
   - Return the newly formatted date string.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `change_date_format` that takes a single string argument `date`.
   - Split the input string `date` using the hyphen '-' as the delimiter. This will give us a list with three elements: year, month, and day.
   - Rearrange the elements of the list to form a new string in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".
   - Return the newly formatted string.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def change_date_format(date: str) -> str:
    # Split the input date string by the '-' delimiter
    parts = date.split('-')
    
    # Rearrange the parts to form the new date format "dd-mm-yyyy"
    new_date = f"{parts[2]}-{parts[1]}-{parts[0]}"
    
    # Return the newly formatted date string
    return new_date
```

This function will take a date string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd", split it into its components, rearrange them, and return the date in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
