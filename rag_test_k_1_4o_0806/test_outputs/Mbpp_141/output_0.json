    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function called `pancake_sort` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list with the numbers sorted in increasing order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The problem is asking us to sort a list of numbers. One way to do this is by using a sorting algorithm. Since the problem doesn't specify which sorting algorithm to use, we can choose one. A simple and intuitive sorting algorithm is the Bubble Sort, which repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function pancake_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           for j from 0 to n-i-1:\n               if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                   swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef pancake_sort(arr):\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # Perform Bubble Sort\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    \n    # Return the sorted array\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the list of numbers in increasing order. It iterates over the list multiple times, swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, until the entire list is sorted.",
