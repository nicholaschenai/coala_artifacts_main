    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if all characters in a given string are the same. If all characters are identical, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if all characters in a string are the same, we can compare each character in the string to the first character. If any character is different, we return `False`. If we reach the end of the string without finding a different character, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function all_Characters_Same(s):\n       if the string is empty:\n           return True (since there are no differing characters)\n       set first_char to the first character of the string\n       for each character in the string:\n           if the character is not equal to first_char:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(s: str) -> bool:\n    # If the string is empty, return True as there are no characters to differ\n    if not s:\n        return True\n    \n    # Get the first character of the string\n    first_char = s[0]\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # If a character is not the same as the first character, return False\n        if char != first_char:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all characters are the same, return True\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function checks each character in the string against the first character. If it finds any character that is different, it returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding a different character, it returns `True`.",
