INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/759 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that checks if a given string represents a decimal number with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, check if the string contains exactly one decimal point.
   - Split the string into two parts using the decimal point as the separator.
   - Ensure that the part before the decimal point is a valid integer (it can be empty, which implies zero).
   - Ensure that the part after the decimal point has exactly two digits.
   - If all these conditions are met, the string is a valid decimal number with a precision of two.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function is_decimal(s):
       if there is not exactly one '.' in s:
           return False
       split s into two parts using '.'
       if the first part is not a valid integer:
           return False
       if the second part does not have exactly two digits:
           return False
       return True
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_decimal(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if there is exactly one decimal point in the string
    if s.count('.') != 1:
        return False
    
    # Split the string into two parts using the decimal point
    integer_part, decimal_part = s.split('.')
    
    # Check if the integer part is a valid integer (it can be empty, which implies zero)
    if integer_part and not integer_part.isdigit():
        return False
    
    # Check if the decimal part has exactly two digits
    if len(decimal_part) != 2 or not decimal_part.isdigit():
        return False
    
    # If all checks pass, return True
    return True
```

This solution checks for the presence of exactly one decimal point, validates the integer part, and ensures the decimal part has exactly two digits, thus confirming the string is a decimal number with a precision of two.
