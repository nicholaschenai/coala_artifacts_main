    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each string in the input tuple.\n   - For each string, we will extract the last character.\n   - We will collect these last characters into a list.\n   - Finally, we will return this list.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named extract_rear that takes a tuple of strings as input.\n   Initialize an empty list to store the last characters.\n   For each string in the tuple:\n       Get the last character of the string.\n       Append the last character to the list.\n   Return the list of last characters.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_rear(strings: tuple) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the last characters\n    last_characters = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each string in the tuple\n    for string in strings:\n        # Get the last character of the current string\n        last_character = string[-1]\n        # Append the last character to the list\n        last_characters.append(last_character)\n    \n    # Return the list of last characters\n    return last_characters\n```",
