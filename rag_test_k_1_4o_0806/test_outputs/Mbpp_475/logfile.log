INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/475 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary as input, where the keys are strings and the values are integers. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary. The list should be sorted in descending order based on the values.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will take the input dictionary and convert it into a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair from the dictionary.
   - We will then sort this list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (the value from the dictionary) in descending order.
   - Finally, we will return the sorted list of tuples.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function sort_counter that takes a dictionary as input
       Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples (key, value)
       Sort the list of tuples by the second element (value) in descending order
       Return the sorted list of tuples
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sort_counter(d: dict) -> list:
    # Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples (key, value)
    items = list(d.items())
    
    # Sort the list of tuples by the second element (value) in descending order
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Return the sorted list of tuples
    return sorted_items
```

This function, `sort_counter`, will take a dictionary as input, convert it to a list of tuples, sort the list by the values in descending order, and return the sorted list.

    Section: Sorting theory
    Part: 2/2
    $};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The array will be divided into two subarrays
    as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,1);
    \draw (5,0) grid (9,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};

    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Then, the subarrays will be sorted recursively
    as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,1);
    \draw (5,0) grid (9,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$3$};

    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Finally, the algorithm merges the sorted
    subarrays and creates the final sorted array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Sorting lower bound}

    Is it possible to sort an array faster
    than in $O(n \log n)$ time?
    It turns out that this is \emph{not} possible
    when we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms
    that are based on comparing array elements.

    The lower bound for the time complexity
    can be proved by considering sorting
    as a process where each comparison of two elements
    gives more information about the contents of the array.
    The process creates the following tree:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) rectangle (3,1);
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (-2.5,-1.5);
    \draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (5.5,-1.5);

    \draw (-4,-2.5) rectangle (-1,-1.5);
    \draw (4,-2.5) rectangle (7,-1.5);
    \node at (-2.5,-2) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (5.5,-2) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-4.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-0.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (3.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (7.5,-4);

    \draw (-6,-5) rectangle (-3,-4);
    \draw (-2,-5) rectangle (1,-4);
    \draw (2,-5) rectangle (5,-4);
    \draw (6,-5) rectangle (9,-4);
    \node at (-4.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (-0.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (3.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (7.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-5.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-3.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (0.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (-1.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (2.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (4.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (6.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (8.5,-6);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Here ''$x<y?$'' means that some elements
    $x$ and $y$ are compared.
    If $x<y$, the process continues to the left,
    and otherwise to the right.
    The results of the process are the possible
    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.
    For this reason, the height of the tree
    must be at least
    \[ \log_2(n!) = \log_2(1)+\log_2(2)+\cdots+\log_2(n).\]
    We get a lower bound for this sum
    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and
    changing the value of each element to $\log_2(n/2)$.
    This yields an estimate
    \[ \log_2(n!) \ge (n/2) \cdot \log_2(n/2),\]
    so the height of the tree and the minimum
    possible number of steps in a sorting
    algorithm in the worst case
    is at least $n \log n$.

    \subsubsection{Counting sort}

    \index{counting sort}

    The lower bound $n \log n$ does not apply to
    algorithms that do not compare array elements
    but use some other information.
    An example of such an algorithm is
    \key{counting sort} that sorts an array in
    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array
    is an integer between $0 \ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.

    The algorithm creates a \emph{bookkeeping} array,
    whose indices are elements of the original array.
    The algorithm iterates through the original array
    and calculates how many times each element
    appears in the array.
    \newpage

    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    corresponds to the following bookkeeping array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (9,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$3$};

    \footnotesize

    \node at (0.5,1.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,1.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,1.5) {$3$};
    \node at (3.5,1.5) {$4$};
    \node at (4.5,1.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,1.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,1.5) {$7$};
    \node at (7.5,1.5) {$8$};
    \node at (8.5,1.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    For example, the value at position 3
    in the bookkeeping array is 2,
    because the element 3 appears 2 times
    in the original array.

    Construction of the bookkeeping array
    takes $O(n)$ time. After this, the sorted array
    can be created in $O(n)$ time because
    the number of occurrences of each element can be retrieved
    from the bookkeeping array.
    Thus, the total time complexity of counting
    sort is $O(n)$.

    Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm
    but it can only be used when the constant $c$
    is small enough, so that the array elements can
    be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.
