The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary. The list should be sorted in descending order based on the values.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will take the input dictionary and convert it into a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair from the dictionary.\n   - We will then sort this list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (the value from the dictionary) in descending order.\n   - Finally, we will return the sorted list of tuples.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function sort_counter that takes a dictionary as input\n       Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples (key, value)\n       Sort the list of tuples by the second element (value) in descending order\n       Return the sorted list of tuples\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sort_counter(d: dict) -> list:\n    # Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples (key, value)\n    items = list(d.items())\n    \n    # Sort the list of tuples by the second element (value) in descending order\n    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n    \n    # Return the sorted list of tuples\n    return sorted_items\n```\n\nThis function, `sort_counter`, will take a dictionary as input, convert it to a list of tuples, sort the list by the values in descending order, and return the sorted list."

(7.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Sorting lower bound}\n\n    Is it possible to sort an array faster\n    than in $O(n \\log n)$ time?\n    It turns out that this is \\emph{not} possible\n    when we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms\n    that are based on comparing array elements.\n\n    The lower bound for the time complexity\n    can be proved by considering sorting\n    as a process where each comparison of two elements\n    gives more information about the contents of the array.\n    The process creates the following tree:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) rectangle (3,1);\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (-2.5,-1.5);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (5.5,-1.5);\n\n    \\draw (-4,-2.5) rectangle (-1,-1.5);\n    \\draw (4,-2.5) rectangle (7,-1.5);\n    \\node at (-2.5,-2) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (5.5,-2) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-4.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-0.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (3.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (7.5,-4);\n\n    \\draw (-6,-5) rectangle (-3,-4);\n    \\draw (-2,-5) rectangle (1,-4);\n    \\draw (2,-5) rectangle (5,-4);\n    \\draw (6,-5) rectangle (9,-4);\n    \\node at (-4.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (-0.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (3.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (7.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-5.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-3.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (0.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (-1.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (2.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (4.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (6.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (8.5,-6);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Here ''$x<y?$'' means that some elements\n    $x$ and $y$ are compared.\n    If $x<y$, the process continues to the left,\n    and otherwise to the right.\n    The results of the process are the possible\n    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.\n    For this reason, the height of the tree\n    must be at least\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) = \\log_2(1)+\\log_2(2)+\\cdots+\\log_2(n).\\]\n    We get a lower bound for this sum\n    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and\n    changing the value of each element to $\\log_2(n/2)$.\n    This yields an estimate\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) \\ge (n/2) \\cdot \\log_2(n/2),\\]\n    so the height of the tree and the minimum\n    possible number of steps in a sorting\n    algorithm in the worst case\n    is at least $n \\log n$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Counting sort}\n\n    \\index{counting sort}\n\n    The lower bound $n \\log n$ does not apply to\n    algorithms that do not compare array elements\n    but use some other information.\n    An example of such an algorithm is\n    \\key{counting sort} that sorts an array in\n    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array\n    is an integer between $0 \\ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.\n\n    The algorithm creates a \\emph{bookkeeping} array,\n    whose indices are elements of the original array.\n    The algorithm iterates through the original array\n    and calculates how many times each element\n    appears in the array.\n    \\newpage\n\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    corresponds to the following bookkeeping array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (9,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (8.5,0.5) {$3$};\n\n    \\footnotesize\n\n    \\node at (0.5,1.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,1.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,1.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (3.5,1.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (4.5,1.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (5.5,1.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (6.5,1.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (7.5,1.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (8.5,1.5) {$9$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    For example, the value at position 3\n    in the bookkeeping array is 2,\n    because the element 3 appears 2 times\n    in the original array.\n\n    Construction of the bookkeeping array\n    takes $O(n)$ time. After this, the sorted array\n    can be created in $O(n)$ time because\n    the number of occurrences of each element can be retrieved\n    from the bookkeeping array.\n    Thus, the total time complexity of counting\n    sort is $O(n)$.\n\n    Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm\n    but it can only be used when the constant $c$\n    is small enough, so that the array elements can\n    be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
