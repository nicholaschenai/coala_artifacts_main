    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that counts the number of lists within a given list of lists. For example, if we have a list containing four sublists, the function should return 4.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The task is straightforward: we need to determine how many elements in the main list are themselves lists. We can achieve this by iterating over each element in the main list and checking if it is a list. We will maintain a counter that increments each time we encounter a list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter to 0\n   For each element in the main list:\n       If the element is a list:\n           Increment the counter by 1\n   Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_list(lists: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of lists\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in lists:\n        # Check if the current element is a list\n        if isinstance(element, list):\n            # Increment the counter if the element is a list\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of lists found\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of lists within the given list of lists by iterating through each element and checking its type.",
