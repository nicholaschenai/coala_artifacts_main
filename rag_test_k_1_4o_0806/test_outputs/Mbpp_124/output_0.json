    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that calculates the angle (in radians) of a given complex number with respect to the positive real axis. The function should be named `angle_complex` and should take a single complex number as input.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the angle of a complex number, we can use the `cmath` module in Python, which provides a function `phase()` that returns the phase angle (in radians) of a complex number. The phase angle is the angle between the positive real axis and the line representing the complex number in the complex plane. We will use this function to compute the angle of the given complex number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function angle_complex with parameter z (a complex number)\n       Use cmath.phase to calculate the angle of z\n       Return the calculated angle\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\n# Define the function to calculate the angle of a complex number\ndef angle_complex(z: complex) -> float:\n    # Use cmath.phase to get the angle of the complex number\n    angle = cmath.phase(z)\n    # Return the calculated angle\n    return angle\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `cmath.phase()` function to compute the angle of the complex number, which is exactly what is needed to solve the problem.",
