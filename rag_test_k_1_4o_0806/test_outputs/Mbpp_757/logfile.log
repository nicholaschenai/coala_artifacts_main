INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/757 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that counts the number of pairs of strings in a given list where one string is the reverse of the other. For example, in the list `["julia", "best", "tseb", "for", "ailuj"]`, the pairs `("julia", "ailuj")` and `("best", "tseb")` are reverse pairs.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Initialize a Counter**: Start with a counter set to zero to keep track of the number of reverse pairs.
2. **Iterate Over the List**: Use a loop to go through each string in the list.
3. **Check for Reverse Pairs**: For each string, check if its reverse exists in the list.
4. **Avoid Double Counting**: If a reverse pair is found, increment the counter and remove both strings from the list to avoid counting them again.
5. **Return the Counter**: After checking all strings, return the counter value.

### Pseudocode

```
function count_reverse_pairs(string_list):
    initialize counter to 0
    while string_list is not empty:
        pop the first string from the list
        reverse the string
        if the reversed string is in the list:
            increment the counter
            remove the reversed string from the list
    return counter
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def count_reverse_pairs(string_list):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of reverse pairs
    count = 0
    
    # Convert the list to a set for faster lookup
    string_set = set(string_list)
    
    # Iterate over each string in the original list
    for string in string_list:
        # Reverse the current string
        reversed_string = string[::-1]
        
        # Check if the reversed string is in the set
        if reversed_string in string_set:
            # Increment the counter for a found pair
            count += 1
            
            # Remove both the string and its reverse from the set
            string_set.remove(string)
            string_set.remove(reversed_string)
    
    # Return the total count of reverse pairs
    return count
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use a set to store the strings for O(1) average time complexity for lookups and removals.
- We iterate over each string in the list, reverse it, and check if the reversed string is in the set.
- If a reverse pair is found, we increment the counter and remove both the string and its reverse from the set to prevent double counting.
- Finally, we return the count of reverse pairs.

    Title: Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$
    Part: 1/2
    # Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$

    ## Statement

    Given string $s$ with length $n$. Find all the pairs $(i, j)$ such that substring $s[i\dots j]$ is a palindrome. String $t$ is a palindrome when $t = t_{rev}$ ($t_{rev}$ is a reversed string for $t$).

    ## More precise statement

    In the worst case string might have up to $O(n^2)$ palindromic substrings, and at the first glance it seems that there is no linear algorithm for this problem.

    But the information about the palindromes can be kept **in a compact way**: for each position $i$ we will find the number of non-empty palindromes centered at this position.

    Palindromes with a common center form a contiguous chain, that is if we have a palindrome of length $l$ centered in $i$, we also have palindromes of lengths $l-2$, $l-4$ and so on also centered in $i$. Therefore, we will collect the information about all palindromic substrings in this way.

    Palindromes of odd and even lengths are accounted for separately as $d_{odd}[i]$ and $d_{even}[i]$. For the palindromes of even length we assume that they're centered in the position $i$ if their two central characters are $s[i]$ and $s[i-1]$.

    For instance, string $s = abababc$ has three palindromes with odd length with centers in the position $s[3] = b$, i. e. $d_{odd}[3] = 3$:

    $$a\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{b}_{s_3}\ a\ b}^{d_{odd}[3]=3} c$$

    And string $s = cbaabd$ has two palindromes with even length with centers in the position $s[3] = a$, i. e. $d_{even}[3] = 2$:

    $$c\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{a}_{s_3}\ b}^{d_{even}[3]=2} d$$

    It's a surprising fact that there is an algorithm, which is simple enough, that calculates these "palindromity arrays" $d_{odd}[]$ and $d_{even}[]$ in linear time. The algorithm is described in this article.

    ## Solution

    In general, this problem has many solutions: with [String Hashing](/string/string-hashing.html) it can be solved in $O(n\cdot \log n)$, and with [Suffix Trees](/string/suffix-tree-ukkonen.html) and fast LCA this problem can be solved in $O(n)$.

    But the method described here is **sufficiently** simpler and has less hidden constant in time and memory complexity. This algorithm was discovered by **Glenn K. Manacher** in 1975.

    Another modern way to solve this problem and to deal with palindromes in general is through the so-called palindromic tree, or eertree.

    ## Trivial algorithm

    To avoid ambiguities in the further description we denote what "trivial algorithm" is.

    It's the algorithm that does the following. For each center position $i$ it tries to increase the answer by one as long as it's possible, comparing a pair of corresponding characters each time.

    Such an algorithm is slow, it can calculate the answer only in $O(n^2)$.

    The implementation of the trivial algorithm is:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        s = "$" + s + "^";
        vector<int> p(n + 2);
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {
                p[i]++;
            }
        }
        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);
    }

   We need to write a function that counts how many pairs of strings in a given list are reverse of each other. For example, if the list contains the strings "abc" and "cba", they form a reverse pair.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Initialize a counter to zero to keep track of the number of reverse pairs.
   - Use a set to store the strings we have seen so far.
   - For each string in the list:
     - Reverse the string.
     - Check if the reversed string is already in the set.
     - If it is, increment the counter because we found a reverse pair.
     - Add the current string to the set for future checks.
   - Return the counter as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function count_reverse_pairs(string_list):
       initialize counter to 0
       initialize an empty set called seen_strings
       
       for each string in string_list:
           reverse the string
           if the reversed string is in seen_strings:
