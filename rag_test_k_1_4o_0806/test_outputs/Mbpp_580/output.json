    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a nested tuple containing integers and removes all the odd numbers from it. The function should return a new tuple with the same structure but only containing even numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to handle tuples that can be nested within other tuples. We will:\n   - Iterate through each element of the tuple.\n   - If the element is an integer, check if it is even. If it is, include it in the result.\n   - If the element is a tuple, recursively apply the same logic to filter out odd numbers from this nested tuple.\n   - Construct a new tuple with the filtered elements and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function `filter_even` that takes a tuple `t` as input:\n       Initialize an empty list `result`\n       For each element `e` in `t`:\n           If `e` is an integer and `e` is even:\n               Append `e` to `result`\n           Else if `e` is a tuple:\n               Recursively call `filter_even` on `e` and append the result to `result`\n       Convert `result` to a tuple and return it\n\n   Define the main function `extract_even` that takes a tuple `nested_tuple` as input:\n       Return the result of calling `filter_even` on `nested_tuple`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef filter_even(t):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the filtered elements\n    result = []\n    # Iterate over each element in the tuple\n    for e in t:\n        # Check if the element is an integer and even\n        if isinstance(e, int) and e % 2 == 0:\n            # Append even integers to the result list\n            result.append(e)\n        # Check if the element is a tuple\n        elif isinstance(e, tuple):\n            # Recursively filter the nested tuple and append the result\n            result.append(filter_even(e))\n    # Convert the result list back to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n\ndef extract_even(nested_tuple):\n    # Call the helper function to filter even numbers from the nested tuple\n    return filter_even(nested_tuple)\n```\n\nThis solution defines a helper function `filter_even` that processes each element of the tuple, checking if it is an integer and even, or if it is a nested tuple that needs further processing. The main function `extract_even` simply calls this helper function on the input tuple.",
