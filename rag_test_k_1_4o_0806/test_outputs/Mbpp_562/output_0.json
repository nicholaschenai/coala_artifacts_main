    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist within it.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate over each sublist in the given list of lists. For each sublist, we will calculate its length using the `len()` function. We will keep track of the maximum length encountered during this iteration. Finally, we will return this maximum length as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function Find_Max_Length that takes a list of lists as input.\n   Initialize a variable max_length to 0.\n   For each sublist in the list of lists:\n       Calculate the length of the sublist.\n       If this length is greater than max_length, update max_length.\n   Return max_length.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Find_Max_Length(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize the maximum length to 0\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Calculate the length of the current sublist\n        current_length = len(sublist)\n        \n        # Update max_length if the current sublist is longer\n        if current_length > max_length:\n            max_length = current_length\n    \n    # Return the maximum length found\n    return max_length\n```",
