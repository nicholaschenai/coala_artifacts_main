    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given two lists of the same length. Our task is to count how many indices have the same value in both lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through both lists simultaneously. For each index, we will compare the elements from both lists. If the elements are the same, we will increase a counter. Finally, we will return the counter as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter to 0\n   For each index from 0 to the length of the lists:\n       If the element at the current index in the first list is equal to the element at the same index in the second list:\n           Increment the counter by 1\n   Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of indices with the same values\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Compare elements at the same index in both lists\n        if list1[i] == list2[i]:\n            # Increment the counter if the elements are the same\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the final count of indices with the same values\n    return count\n```",
