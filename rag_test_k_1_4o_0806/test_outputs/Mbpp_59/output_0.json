    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth octagonal number. An octagonal number is a figurate number that represents an octagon. The formula for the nth octagonal number is given by: \\( O_n = 3n^2 - 2n \\).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth octagonal number, we can use the formula \\( O_n = 3n^2 - 2n \\). This formula directly gives us the nth octagonal number when we substitute n into it. Therefore, the solution involves a simple calculation using this formula.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function is_octagonal(n):\n       Calculate the nth octagonal number using the formula: 3 * n^2 - 2 * n\n       Return the calculated octagonal number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_octagonal(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth octagonal number using the formula: 3n^2 - 2n\n    octagonal_number = 3 * n * n - 2 * n\n    # Return the calculated octagonal number\n    return octagonal_number\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth octagonal number by applying the formula \\( O_n = 3n^2 - 2n \\).",
