    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as the difference of two perfect squares. In other words, we need to check if there exist two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a^2 - b^2 = n\\).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The difference of two squares can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, for a number \\(n\\) to be expressed as the difference of two squares, it must be possible to write \\(n\\) as a product of two integers, say \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), where \\(x = a-b\\) and \\(y = a+b\\). \n\n   - If \\(n\\) is odd, it can always be expressed as the difference of two squares. This is because we can choose \\(a = \\frac{n+1}{2}\\) and \\(b = \\frac{n-1}{2}\\), which are integers.\n   - If \\(n\\) is even, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if \\(n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}\\). This is because for even \\(n\\), both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) must be even for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to be integers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function dif_Square(n):\n       if n is odd:\n           return True\n       else:\n           if n % 4 == 0:\n               return True\n           else:\n               return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is odd\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        return True\n    else:\n        # Check if the number is divisible by 4\n        if n % 4 == 0:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n```\n\nThis function checks if a given integer \\(n\\) can be represented as the difference of two squares by using the properties of numbers and their divisibility.",
