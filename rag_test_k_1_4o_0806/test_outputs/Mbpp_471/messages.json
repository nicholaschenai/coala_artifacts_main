You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \\sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\\frac{p}{q}$.\n\n        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \\;\\bmod\\; M$ for $1 \\leq x \\leq N$.\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.\n\n        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \\equiv qr \\pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \\equiv p_2 q_1 \\pmod m$. Assuming that $\\frac{p_1}{q_1} \\neq \\frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.\n\n        In the statement we were told that $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.\n\n        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr \\;\\bmod\\; m \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \\bmod m$ for $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $\\frac{r}{m} q - k \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\\frac{r}{m}$.\n\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m \n            def mod_min(r, n, m):\n                a = fraction(r, m)\n                p, q = convergents(a)\n                for i in range(2, len(q)):\n                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):\n                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]\n                        return q[i-1] + t*q[i]\n            ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
