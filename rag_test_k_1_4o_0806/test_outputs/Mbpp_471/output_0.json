    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and another integer `n`. The function should calculate the product of all the integers in the list and then return the remainder when this product is divided by `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start with a variable to hold the product, initialized to 1.\n   - Iterate over each number in the list.\n   - Multiply the current product by each number in the list.\n   - After calculating the total product, compute the remainder of this product when divided by `n`.\n   - Return the remainder.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_remainder(arr, n):\n       initialize product to 1\n       for each number in arr:\n           multiply product by number\n       remainder = product modulo n\n       return remainder\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    # Initialize the product to 1\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        # Multiply the current product by the number\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Calculate the remainder of the product divided by n\n    remainder = product % n\n    \n    # Return the remainder\n    return remainder\n```",
