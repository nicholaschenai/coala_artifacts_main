        "content": "\n## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if a given list of integers represents a min heap. A min heap is a binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes. In an array representation of a binary heap, for any element at index `i`, the left child is at index `2*i + 1` and the right child is at index `2*i + 2`. We need to check if this property holds for the entire array.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo check if the array represents a min heap, we need to verify that for every element at index `i`, the element is less than or equal to its left child (if it exists) and its right child (if it exists). We will iterate through each element in the array up to the last parent node and check these conditions.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `check_min_heap(arr)`.\n2. Get the length of the array `n`.\n3. Iterate over each index `i` from 0 to `n//2 - 1` (the last parent node):\n   - Calculate the left child index as `2*i + 1`.\n   - Calculate the right child index as `2*i + 2`.\n   - If the left child index is within bounds and `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[left]`, return `False`.\n   - If the right child index is within bounds and `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[right]`, return `False`.\n4. If all conditions are satisfied, return `True`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_min_heap(arr):\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # Iterate over each parent node\n    for i in range(n // 2):\n        # Calculate the left and right child indices\n        left = 2 * i + 1\n        right = 2 * i + 2\n        \n        # Check if the left child exists and is greater than the parent\n        if left < n and arr[i] > arr[left]:\n            return False\n        \n        # Check if the right child exists and is greater than the parent\n        if right < n and arr[i] > arr[right]:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all checks pass, the array is a min heap\n    return True\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the array, checking the min heap property for each parent node. If any parent node violates the min heap property, the function returns `False`. If all nodes satisfy the property, it returns `True`."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Binary search\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n\n    ### Binary search on the answer\n\n    Such situation often occurs when we're asked to compute some value, but we're only capable of checking whether this value is at least $i$. For example, you're given an array $a_1,\\dots,a_n$ and you're asked to find the maximum floored average sum\n\n    $$\n    \\left \\lfloor \\frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \\right\\rfloor\n    $$\n\n    among all possible pairs of $l,r$ such that $r-l \\geq x$. One of simple ways to solve this problem is to check whether the answer is at least $\\lambda$, that is if there is a pair $l, r$ such that the following is true:\n\n    $$\n    \\frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \\geq \\lambda.\n    $$\n\n    Equivalently, it rewrites as\n\n    $$\n    (a_l - \\lambda) + (a_{l+1} - \\lambda) + \\dots + (a_r - \\lambda) \\geq 0,\n    $$\n\n    so now we need to check whether there is a subarray of a new array $a_i - \\lambda$ of length at least $x+1$ with non-negative sum, which is doable with some prefix sums.\n\n    ## Continuous search\n\n    Let $f : \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R$ be a real-valued function that is continuous on a segment $[L, R]$.\n\n    Without loss of generality assume that $f(L) \\leq f(R)$. From [intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem) it follows that for any $y \\in [f(L), f(R)]$ there is $x \\in [L, R]$ such that $f(x) = y$. Note that, unlike previous paragraphs, the function is _not_ required to be monotonous.\n\n    The value $x$ could be approximated up to $\\pm\\delta$ in $O\\left(\\log \\frac{R-L}{\\delta}\\right)$ time for any specific value of $\\delta$. The idea is essentially the same, if we take $M \\in (L, R)$ then we would be able to reduce the search interval to either $[L, M]$ or $[M, R]$ depending on whether $f(M)$ is larger than $y$. One common example here would be finding roots of odd-degree polynomials.\n\n    For example, let $f(x)=x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. Then $f(L) \\to -\\infty$ and $f(R) \\to +\\infty$ with $L \\to -\\infty$ and $R \\to +\\infty$. Which means that it is always possible to find sufficiently small $L$ and sufficiently large $R$ such that $f(L) < 0$ and $f(R) > 0$. Then, it is possible to find with binary search arbitrarily small interval containing $x$ such that $f(x)=0$.\n\n    ## Search with powers of 2\n\n    Another noteworthy way to do binary search is, instead of maintaining an active segment, to maintain the current pointer $i$ and the current power $k$. The pointer starts at $i=L$ and then on each iteration one tests the predicate at point $i+2^k$. If the predicate is still $0$, the pointer is advanced from $i$ to $i+2^k$, otherwise it stays the same, then the power $k$ is decreased by $1$.\n\n    This paradigm is widely used in tasks around trees, such as finding lowest common ancestor of two vertices or finding an ancestor of a specific vertex that has a certain height. It could also be adapted to e.g. find the $k$-th non-zero element in a Fenwick tree.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
