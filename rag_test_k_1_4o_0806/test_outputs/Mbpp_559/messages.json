        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the sum of the largest contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. A contiguous sublist is a sequence of elements that appear consecutively in the list. The task is to identify the sublist with the maximum sum and return that sum.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use Kadane's Algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time. The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. Initialize two variables: `max_so_far` to store the maximum sum found so far, and `max_ending_here` to store the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position.\n2. Iterate through each element in the list:\n   - Update `max_ending_here` by adding the current element to it.\n   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `max_so_far`, update `max_so_far`.\n   - If `max_ending_here` becomes negative, reset it to zero, as a negative sum would not contribute to a maximum sum in future subarrays.\n3. After iterating through the list, `max_so_far` will contain the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):\n    max_so_far = -infinity\n    max_ending_here = 0\n\n    for each element in arr:\n        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + element\n        if max_so_far < max_ending_here:\n            max_so_far = max_ending_here\n        if max_ending_here < 0:\n            max_ending_here = 0\n\n    return max_so_far\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_sub_array_sum(arr: list, n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum sum so far to a very small number\n    max_so_far = float('-inf')\n    # Initialize the maximum sum ending at the current position to 0\n    max_ending_here = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each element in the array\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Update the maximum sum ending here by adding the current element\n        max_ending_here += arr[i]\n        \n        # Update the maximum sum so far if the current max ending here is greater\n        if max_so_far < max_ending_here:\n            max_so_far = max_ending_here\n        \n        # If the current max ending here is negative, reset it to 0\n        if max_ending_here < 0:\n            max_ending_here = 0\n\n    # Return the maximum sum found\n    return max_so_far\n```\n\nThis code implements Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the given list. It efficiently computes the result in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes."

It is required to find a subarray $a[l \\ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:\n\n    $$ \\max_{ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.\n    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\n    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.\n\n    ## Algorithm 1\n\n    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm is very simple.\n\n    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.\n\n    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \\ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.\n\n    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.\n\n    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.\n\n    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ \u2014 we will only need the current element from it.\n\n    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.\n\n    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        int cur = sum - min_sum;\n        if (cur > ans) {\n            ans = cur;\n            ans_l = min_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < min_sum) {\n            min_sum = sum;\n            min_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Algorithm 2\n\n    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.\n\n    **Proof:**\n\n    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum \u2014 so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.\n\n    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.\n\n    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a \"critical\" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \\ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.\n\n    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum);\n        sum = max(sum, 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        if (sum > ans) {\n            ans = sum;\n            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < 0) {\n            sum = 0;\n            minus_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

We also keep track of the maximum sum encountered during the iteration. This approach ensures that we find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in linear time.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize max_sum to the first element of the list\n   Initialize current_sum to 0\n\n   For each element in the list:\n       Add the element to current_sum\n       If current_sum is greater than max_sum:\n           Update max_sum to current_sum\n       If current_sum is less than 0:\n           Reset current_sum to 0\n\n   Return max_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_sub_array_sum(arr: list, n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize max_sum to the first element of the list\n    max_sum = arr[0]\n    # Initialize current_sum to 0\n    current_sum = 0\n\n    # Iterate through each element in the list\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Add the current element to current_sum\n        current_sum += arr[i]\n        # Update max_sum if current_sum is greater\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            max_sum = current_sum\n        # Reset current_sum to 0 if it becomes negative\n        if current_sum < 0:\n            current_sum = 0\n\n    # Return the maximum sum found\n    return max_sum\n```\n\nThis code implements Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the given list.
