INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/559 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the sum of the largest contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. A contiguous sublist is a sequence of elements that appear consecutively in the list. The task is to identify the sublist with the maximum sum and return that sum.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use Kadane's Algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize two variables: `max_so_far` to store the maximum sum found so far, and `max_ending_here` to store the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position.
2. Iterate through each element in the list:
   - Update `max_ending_here` by adding the current element to it.
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `max_so_far`, update `max_so_far`.
   - If `max_ending_here` becomes negative, reset it to zero, as a negative sum would not contribute to a maximum sum in future subarrays.
3. After iterating through the list, `max_so_far` will contain the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):
    max_so_far = -infinity
    max_ending_here = 0

    for each element in arr:
        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + element
        if max_so_far < max_ending_here:
            max_so_far = max_ending_here
        if max_ending_here < 0:
            max_ending_here = 0

    return max_so_far
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def max_sub_array_sum(arr: list, n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the maximum sum so far to a very small number
    max_so_far = float('-inf')
    # Initialize the maximum sum ending at the current position to 0
    max_ending_here = 0

    # Iterate over each element in the array
    for i in range(n):
        # Update the maximum sum ending here by adding the current element
        max_ending_here += arr[i]
        
        # Update the maximum sum so far if the current max ending here is greater
        if max_so_far < max_ending_here:
            max_so_far = max_ending_here
        
        # If the current max ending here is negative, reset it to 0
        if max_ending_here < 0:
            max_ending_here = 0

    # Return the maximum sum found
    return max_so_far
```

This code implements Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the given list. It efficiently computes the result in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 1/2
    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum

    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).

    ## Problem statement

    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:

    $$ \max_{ 1 \le l \le r \le n } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.
    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.

    ## Algorithm 1

    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm is very simple.

    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.

    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.

    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.

    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.

    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.

    ### Implementation

    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ â€” we will only need the current element from it.

    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.

    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);
        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);
    }
    ```

    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        int cur = sum - min_sum;
        if (cur > ans) {
            ans = cur;
            ans_l = min_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = sum;
            min_pos = r;
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Algorithm 2

    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.

    **Proof:**

    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum â€” so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.

    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.

    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a "critical" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.

    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.

    ### Implementation

    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum);
        sum = max(sum, 0);
    }
    ```

    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        if (sum > ans) {
            ans = sum;
            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < 0) {
            sum = 0;
            minus_pos = r;
        }
    }

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   We can use Kadane's Algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. The idea is to iterate through the list while maintaining a running sum of the current subarray. If the running sum becomes negative, we reset it to zero because a negative sum would not contribute to a maximum sum of any subarray. We also keep track of the maximum sum encountered during the iteration. This approach ensures that we find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in linear time.
