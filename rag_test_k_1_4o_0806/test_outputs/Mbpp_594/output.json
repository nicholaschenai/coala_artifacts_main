    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and finds the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Iterate through the list of numbers.\n   - Keep track of whether we have found the first even number and the first odd number.\n   - As soon as we find the first even number, store it.\n   - As soon as we find the first odd number, store it.\n   - Once both the first even and first odd numbers are found, calculate the difference between them.\n   - Return the difference.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize first_even and first_odd to None\n   For each number in the list:\n       If the number is even and first_even is None:\n           Set first_even to this number\n       If the number is odd and first_odd is None:\n           Set first_odd to this number\n       If both first_even and first_odd are not None:\n           Break the loop\n   Return the absolute difference between first_even and first_odd\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef diff_even_odd(numbers):\n    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers\n    first_even = None\n    first_odd = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of numbers\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even and we haven't found an even number yet\n        if num % 2 == 0 and first_even is None:\n            first_even = num\n        # Check if the number is odd and we haven't found an odd number yet\n        if num % 2 != 0 and first_odd is None:\n            first_odd = num\n        # If both first even and odd numbers are found, break the loop\n        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # Return the absolute difference between the first even and odd numbers\n    return abs(first_even - first_odd)\n```",
