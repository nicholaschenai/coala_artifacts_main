    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts how many times a specific number appears in a given list of numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and check if it matches the number we are looking for. We will maintain a counter that increments each time we find a match. Finally, we return the counter as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function frequency(lst, num):\n       initialize counter to 0\n       for each element in lst:\n           if element equals num:\n               increment counter\n       return counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef frequency(lst, num):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # If the current element matches the number we're looking for\n        if element == num:\n            # Increment the counter\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n```",
