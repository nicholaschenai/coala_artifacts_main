    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if every number at an even index in a given list is an even number. If all numbers at even indices are even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Iterate over the list, focusing only on the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).\n   - For each even index, check if the number at that index is even.\n   - If any number at an even index is not even, return `False`.\n   - If all numbers at even indices are even, return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function even_position(lst):\n       for each index i from 0 to length of lst - 1, step by 2:\n           if lst[i] is not even:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef even_position(lst):\n    # Iterate over the list, checking only even indices\n    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):\n        # Check if the number at the current even index is not even\n        if lst[i] % 2 != 0:\n            # If any number at an even index is not even, return False\n            return False\n    # If all numbers at even indices are even, return True\n    return True\n```",
