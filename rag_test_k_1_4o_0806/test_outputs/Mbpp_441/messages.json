The area of one face of the cube is the side length squared. Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is six times the area of one face. To find the surface area, we multiply the square of the side length by six.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `surfacearea_cube` that takes one parameter `side_length`.\n   - Calculate the area of one face by squaring the `side_length`.\n   - Multiply the area of one face by 6 to get the total surface area.\n   - Return the total surface area.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef surfacearea_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of one face of the cube\n    face_area = side_length * side_length\n    \n    # Calculate the total surface area by multiplying the face area by 6\n    total_surface_area = 6 * face_area\n    \n    # Return the total surface area\n    return total_surface_area\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the surface area of a cube given the side length, as demonstrated by the assertion `assert surfacearea_cube(5) == 150`."
