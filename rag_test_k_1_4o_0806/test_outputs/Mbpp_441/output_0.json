    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the surface area of a cube given the length of one of its sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   A cube has six faces, and each face is a square. The area of one square face is the side length squared. Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is six times the area of one face. To find the surface area, we multiply the side length by itself to get the area of one face, and then multiply that result by six.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function surfacearea_cube(side_length):\n       area_of_one_face = side_length * side_length\n       total_surface_area = 6 * area_of_one_face\n       return total_surface_area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef surfacearea_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of one face of the cube\n    area_of_one_face = side_length * side_length\n    # Calculate the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by 6\n    total_surface_area = 6 * area_of_one_face\n    # Return the total surface area\n    return total_surface_area\n```",
