    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given list (sublist) is contained within another list (main list) as a contiguous sequence of elements. The function should return `True` if the sublist is found within the main list, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if a sublist is present in a main list, we can iterate over the main list and check if any contiguous segment of it matches the sublist. This involves checking each possible starting position in the main list and seeing if the subsequent elements match the sublist. If we find a match, we return `True`. If we finish checking all possible starting positions without finding a match, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function is_sublist(main_list, sublist):\n       If the length of sublist is 0, return True (an empty sublist is always a sublist)\n       If the length of sublist is greater than the length of main_list, return False\n       \n       For each index i from 0 to (length of main_list - length of sublist):\n           If the slice of main_list from i to i + length of sublist is equal to sublist:\n               Return True\n       \n       Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_sublist(main_list, sublist):\n    # An empty sublist is always considered a sublist\n    if len(sublist) == 0:\n        return True\n    \n    # If the sublist is longer than the main list, it cannot be a sublist\n    if len(sublist) > len(main_list):\n        return False\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible starting index in the main list\n    for i in range(len(main_list) - len(sublist) + 1):\n        # Check if the slice of main_list from i to i + length of sublist matches the sublist\n        if main_list[i:i + len(sublist)] == sublist:\n            return True\n    \n    # If no match is found, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if the `sublist` is a contiguous part of the `main_list`.",
