INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/94 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We have a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a number. We need to find the tuple with the smallest number and return the name from that tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through the list of tuples to find the tuple with the smallest second value (the number). We will keep track of the smallest number found so far and the corresponding name. Once we have checked all tuples, we will return the name associated with the smallest number.

3. **Pseudocode Solution:**
   - Initialize a variable to store the smallest number found so far, set it to a very large number initially.
   - Initialize a variable to store the name associated with the smallest number.
   - Loop through each tuple in the list:
     - If the number in the current tuple is smaller than the smallest number found so far:
       - Update the smallest number.
       - Update the name associated with this smallest number.
   - After the loop, return the name associated with the smallest number.

4. **Final Python 3 Solution:**

```python
def index_minimum(tuples_list):
    # Initialize the smallest number to a very large value
    smallest_number = float('inf')
    # Initialize the name associated with the smallest number
    smallest_name = None
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for name, number in tuples_list:
        # Check if the current number is smaller than the smallest number found so far
        if number < smallest_number:
            # Update the smallest number
            smallest_number = number
            # Update the name associated with the smallest number
            smallest_name = name
    
    # Return the name associated with the smallest number
    return smallest_name
```

This solution iterates through the list of tuples once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of tuples in the list.

    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Minimizing sums
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.
