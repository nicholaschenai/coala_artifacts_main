    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given tuple contains any duplicate elements. If there are duplicates, the function should return `False`; otherwise, it should return `True`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if a tuple contains duplicates, we can convert the tuple into a set. A set automatically removes any duplicate elements. If the length of the set is the same as the length of the tuple, it means there were no duplicates in the tuple. If the lengths differ, it means there were duplicates.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function check_distinct(input_tuple):\n       Convert the input_tuple to a set\n       Compare the length of the set with the length of the input_tuple\n       If lengths are equal:\n           Return True (no duplicates)\n       Else:\n           Return False (duplicates exist)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_distinct(input_tuple: tuple) -> bool:\n    # Convert the tuple to a set, which removes duplicates\n    unique_elements = set(input_tuple)\n    \n    # Compare the length of the set with the length of the tuple\n    # If they are equal, there are no duplicates\n    return len(unique_elements) == len(input_tuple)\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if a tuple contains duplicates by leveraging the properties of a set in Python.",
