    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The function should return the area as an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying its length by its width. Therefore, the function should take two arguments, the length and the width, and return the product of these two values.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named rectangle_area that takes two parameters: length and width.\n   Calculate the area by multiplying length and width.\n   Return the calculated area.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\n# Define the function rectangle_area with parameters length and width\ndef rectangle_area(length: int, width: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area by multiplying length and width\n    area = length * width\n    # Return the calculated area\n    return area\n```",
