    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that takes two integers as input and returns the sum of their common divisors. A common divisor of two numbers is a number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Identify all divisors of the first number.\n   - Identify all divisors of the second number.\n   - Find the common divisors between the two sets of divisors.\n   - Sum up these common divisors and return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function sum(a, b):\n       initialize common_divisors_sum to 0\n       for each number i from 1 to the minimum of a and b:\n           if i is a divisor of both a and b:\n               add i to common_divisors_sum\n       return common_divisors_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of common divisors to 0\n    common_divisors_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to the minimum of a and b\n    for i in range(1, min(a, b) + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of both a and b\n        if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:\n            # Add i to the sum of common divisors\n            common_divisors_sum += i\n    \n    # Return the total sum of common divisors\n    return common_divisors_sum\n```\n\nThis function iterates through all possible divisors up to the smaller of the two numbers, checks if each number is a divisor of both, and accumulates the sum of these common divisors.",
