    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the smallest difference between any two numbers in a given list of integers. The function should take a tuple of integers and the number of elements in the tuple as inputs and return the minimum difference between any two elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the minimum difference between any two elements in the list, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, sort the list of numbers. Sorting helps because the smallest difference between any two numbers will be between two consecutive numbers in a sorted list.\n   - Then, iterate through the sorted list and calculate the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers.\n   - Keep track of the smallest difference encountered during this iteration.\n   - Return the smallest difference found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_min_diff(arr, n):\n       sort the array arr\n       initialize min_diff to a large number\n       for i from 0 to n-2:\n           calculate diff as arr[i+1] - arr[i]\n           if diff is less than min_diff:\n               update min_diff to diff\n       return min_diff\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_min_diff(arr: tuple, n: int) -> int:\n    # Convert the tuple to a list and sort it\n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)\n    \n    # Initialize the minimum difference to a large number\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the minimum difference\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        # Calculate the difference between consecutive elements\n        diff = sorted_arr[i + 1] - sorted_arr[i]\n        \n        # Update min_diff if the current difference is smaller\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n    \n    # Return the smallest difference found\n    return min_diff\n```\n\nThis solution sorts the array and then finds the minimum difference between consecutive elements, ensuring that the smallest possible difference is found efficiently.",
