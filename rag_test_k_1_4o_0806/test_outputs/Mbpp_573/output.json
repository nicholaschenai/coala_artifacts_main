    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the product of all unique numbers in that list. This means we should first identify the unique numbers in the list, then multiply them together to get the result.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to identify the unique numbers in the list. We can do this by converting the list to a set, which automatically removes duplicates.\n   - Once we have the set of unique numbers, we need to calculate the product of these numbers.\n   - Initialize a variable to store the product, starting with a value of 1 (since multiplying by 1 does not change the product).\n   - Iterate over the set of unique numbers, multiplying each number with the product variable.\n   - Finally, return the product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function unique_product with parameter lst\n       Convert lst to a set to get unique numbers\n       Initialize product to 1\n       For each number in the set of unique numbers\n           Multiply product by the number\n       Return product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef unique_product(lst):\n    # Convert the list to a set to get unique numbers\n    unique_numbers = set(lst)\n    \n    # Initialize the product to 1\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Iterate over each unique number and multiply it to the product\n    for number in unique_numbers:\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Return the final product\n    return product\n```",
