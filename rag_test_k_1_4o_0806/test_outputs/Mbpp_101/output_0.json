    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and an integer `k`, and returns the `k`-th element of the list using 1-based indexing. This means that if `k` is 1, we return the first element of the list, if `k` is 2, we return the second element, and so on.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The solution involves accessing the `k`-th element of the list. Since Python uses 0-based indexing, we need to adjust the index by subtracting 1 from `k` to get the correct element. For example, to get the 1st element in 1-based indexing, we access the 0th element in 0-based indexing.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function kth_element with parameters array and k\n       Return the element at index (k - 1) from the array\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef kth_element(array, k):\n    # Return the k-th element using 1-based indexing by accessing (k-1) index\n    return array[k - 1]\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the `k`-th element of the list using 1-based indexing by adjusting the index to 0-based indexing, which is how Python lists are accessed.",
