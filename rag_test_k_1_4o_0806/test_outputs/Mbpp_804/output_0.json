    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that checks if the product of all numbers in a given list is even. If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if the product of numbers in a list is even, we only need to check if there is at least one even number in the list. This is because the presence of any even number in a multiplication will result in an even product. Therefore, we can iterate through the list and check if any number is even. If we find an even number, we can immediately return `True`. If we finish checking all numbers and find none are even, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function is_product_even that takes a list of integers as input\n       For each number in the list\n           If the number is even (i.e., number % 2 == 0)\n               Return True\n       Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_product_even(numbers: list) -> bool:\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If an even number is found, the product is even\n            return True\n    # If no even number is found, the product is not even\n    return False\n```",
