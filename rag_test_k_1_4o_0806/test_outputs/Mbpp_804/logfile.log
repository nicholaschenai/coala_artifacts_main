INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/804 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that determines if the product of all numbers in a given list is even. If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Even Product**: A product of numbers is even if at least one of the numbers in the list is even. This is because multiplying any number by an even number results in an even product.

2. **Approach**: 
   - Iterate through each number in the list.
   - Check if any number is even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder).
   - If an even number is found, return `True` immediately.
   - If the loop completes without finding an even number, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_product_even(numbers):
    for each number in numbers:
        if number is even:
            return True
    return False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_product_even(numbers):
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the current number is even
        if number % 2 == 0:
            # If an even number is found, the product is even
            return True
    # If no even number is found, the product is not even
    return False
```

   We need to create a function that checks if the product of all numbers in a given list is even. If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To determine if the product of numbers in a list is even, we only need to check if there is at least one even number in the list. This is because the presence of any even number in a multiplication will result in an even product. Therefore, we can iterate through the list and check if any number is even. If we find an even number, we can immediately return `True`. If we finish checking all numbers and find none are even, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function is_product_even that takes a list of integers as input
       For each number in the list
           If the number is even (i.e., number % 2 == 0)
