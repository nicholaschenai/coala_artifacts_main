The function will take three parameters: the base of the triangle, the height of the triangle, and the length of the prism. The function should return the volume of the prism.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the formula for the volume of a triangular prism**: \n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     V = \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Length}\n     \\]\n   - The base area of the triangular face is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Base Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the volume of the prism is:\n     \\[\n     V = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height}\\right) \\times \\text{Length}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Plan the function**:\n   - The function will take three arguments: `base`, `height`, and `length`.\n   - Calculate the base area using the formula for the area of a triangle.\n   - Multiply the base area by the length to get the volume.\n   - Return the calculated volume.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_Volume(base, height, length):\n    base_area = (1/2) * base * height\n    volume = base_area * length\n    return volume\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_Volume(base: float, height: float, length: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the area of the triangular base\n    base_area = 0.5 * base * height\n    # Calculate the volume of the triangular prism\n    volume = base_area * length\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```"

For any $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ there is exactly one vector $\\mathbf r$ such that $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf a\\cdot\\mathbf r$ for any vector $\\mathbf a$. <br>Indeed if there are two such vectors $\\mathbf r_1$ and $\\mathbf r_2$ then $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf r_1 - \\mathbf r_2)=0$ for all vectors $\\mathbf a$ which is possible only when $\\mathbf r_1 = \\mathbf r_2$.\n    4.  $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf b\\cdot (\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf a) = -\\mathbf a\\cdot( \\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf b)$\n    5.  $(\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c = \\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$.\n        Indeed for all vectors $\\mathbf r$ the chain of equations holds:\n\n        \\[\\mathbf r\\cdot( (\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c) = (\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b) \\cdot (\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) =  \\mathbf a \\cdot(\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) + \\mathbf b\\cdot(\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) = \\mathbf r\\cdot (\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c) + \\mathbf r\\cdot(\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf r\\cdot(\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c)\\]\n\n        Which proves $(\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c = \\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ due to point 3.\n\n    6.  $|\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b|=|\\mathbf a| \\cdot |\\mathbf b| \\sin \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is angle between $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$, since $|\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b|$ equals to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$. \n\n    Given all this and that the following equation holds for the unit vectors\n\n    $$\\mathbf e_x\\times \\mathbf e_x = \\mathbf e_y\\times \\mathbf e_y = \\mathbf e_z\\times \\mathbf e_z = \\mathbf 0,\\\\\n    \\mathbf e_x\\times \\mathbf e_y = \\mathbf e_z,~\\mathbf e_y\\times \\mathbf e_z = \\mathbf e_x,~\\mathbf e_z\\times \\mathbf e_x = \\mathbf e_y$$\n\n    we can calculate the cross product of $\\mathbf a = (x_1;y_1;z_1)$ and $\\mathbf b = (x_2;y_2;z_2)$ in coordinate form:\n\n    $$\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b = (x_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_x + y_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_y + z_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_z)\\times (x_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_x + y_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_y + z_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_z) =$$\n\n    $$(y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2)\\mathbf e_x  + (z_1 x_2 - x_1 z_2)\\mathbf e_y + (x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2)$$\n\n    Which also can be written in the more elegant form:\n\n    $$\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b = \\begin{vmatrix}\\mathbf e_x & \\mathbf e_y & \\mathbf e_z \\\\ x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\end{vmatrix},~a\\cdot(b\\times c) = \\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & z_3 \\end{vmatrix}$$\n\n    Here $| \\cdot |$ stands for the determinant of a matrix. \n\n    Some kind of cross product (namely the pseudo-scalar product) can also be implemented in the 2D case.\n    If we would like to calculate the area of parallelogram formed by vectors $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$ we would compute $|\\mathbf e_z\\cdot(\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b)| = |x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2|$.\n    Another way to obtain the same result is to multiply $|\\mathbf a|$ (base of parallelogram) with the height, which is the projection of vector $\\mathbf b$ onto vector $\\mathbf a$ rotated by $90^\\circ$ which in turn is $\\widehat{\\mathbf a}=(-y_1;x_1)$.\n    That is, to calculate $|\\widehat{\\mathbf a}\\cdot\\mathbf b|=|x_1y_2 - y_1 x_2|$. \n\n    If we will take the sign into consideration then the area will be positive if the rotation from $\\mathbf a$ to $\\mathbf b$ (i.e. from the view of the point of $\\mathbf e_z$) is performed counter-clockwise and negative otherwise.\n    That defines the pseudo-scalar product.\n    Note that it also equals $|\\mathbf a| \\cdot |\\mathbf b| \\sin \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is angle from $\\mathbf a$ to $\\mathbf b$ count counter-clockwise (and negative if rotation is clockwise).\n\n    Let's implement all this stuff!\n\n    ```{.cpp file=crossproduct}\n    point3d cross(point3d a, point3d b) {\n        return point3d(a.y * b.z - a.z * b.y,\n                       a.z * b.x - a.x * b.z,\n                       a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x);\n    }\n    ftype triple(point3d a, point3d b, point3d c) {\n        return dot(a, cross(b, c));\n    }\n    ftype cross(point2d a, point2d b) {\n        return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
