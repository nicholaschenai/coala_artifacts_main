    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism given its base area and height. The function should take three arguments: the base area of the triangular face, the height of the prism, and the height of the triangular base. The function should return the volume of the prism.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The volume of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height}\n   \\]\n   where the \"Base Area\" is the area of the triangular base, and \"Height\" is the perpendicular distance between the two triangular bases (the length of the prism). Given the inputs, we can directly apply this formula to compute the volume.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_Volume(base_area, base_height, prism_height):\n       volume = base_area * prism_height\n       return volume\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_Volume(base_area: float, base_height: float, prism_height: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the volume of the triangular prism using the formula:\n    # Volume = Base Area * Height of the prism\n    volume = base_area * prism_height\n    return volume\n```\n\nThis function takes the base area of the triangular face, the height of the triangular base, and the height of the prism as inputs, and returns the volume of the triangular prism. The calculation is straightforward using the formula for the volume of a prism.",
