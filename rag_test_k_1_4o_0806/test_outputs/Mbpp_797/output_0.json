    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all odd natural numbers within a given range, inclusive of the endpoints. The function should take two integers, `l` and `r`, as input and return the sum of all odd numbers between these two values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the range from `l` to `r`. For each number, we will check if it is odd. If it is odd, we will add it to a running total. Finally, we will return the total sum of all odd numbers found in the range.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0\n   For each number `n` from `l` to `r` (inclusive):\n       If `n` is odd (i.e., `n % 2 != 0`):\n           Add `n` to `total_sum`\n   Return `total_sum`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(l: int, r: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of odd numbers to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each number from l to r (inclusive)\n    for n in range(l, r + 1):\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if n % 2 != 0:\n            # Add the odd number to the total sum\n            total_sum += n\n    \n    # Return the total sum of odd numbers\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the range from `l` to `r`, checks if each number is odd, and accumulates the sum of all odd numbers. The final result is returned as the sum of all odd numbers in the specified range.",
