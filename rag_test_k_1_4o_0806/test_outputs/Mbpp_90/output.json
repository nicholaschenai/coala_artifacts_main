    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest word in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each word in the list, calculate its length, and keep track of the maximum length encountered. At the end of the iteration, the maximum length will be the length of the longest word in the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function len_log that takes a list of words as input.\n   Initialize a variable max_length to 0.\n   For each word in the list:\n       Calculate the length of the word.\n       If the length of the word is greater than max_length:\n           Update max_length with the length of the word.\n   Return max_length.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef len_log(words: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum length to 0\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words:\n        # Calculate the length of the current word\n        word_length = len(word)\n        \n        # Update max_length if the current word's length is greater\n        if word_length > max_length:\n            max_length = word_length\n    \n    # Return the length of the longest word\n    return max_length\n```",
