INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/273 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. Each tuple contains numbers. The function should subtract each element of the first tuple by the corresponding element in the second tuple (i.e., element-wise subtraction) and return a new tuple with the results.

### Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
2. For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will subtract the element from the second tuple from the element in the first tuple.
3. We will store the result of each subtraction in a new tuple.
4. Finally, we will return the new tuple containing all the results.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `substract_elements` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
2. Initialize an empty list `result`.
3. Loop over the indices of the tuples (assuming both tuples are of the same length):
   - Subtract the element at the current index of `tuple2` from the element at the same index of `tuple1`.
   - Append the result to the `result` list.
4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple.
5. Return the resulting tuple.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def substract_elements(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the subtraction
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Subtract the element in tuple2 from the element in tuple1 at the same index
        subtraction = tuple1[i] - tuple2[i]
        # Append the result to the result list
        result.append(subtraction)
    
    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)

    ## Other problems

    So far we were discussing the problem of finding the sum of elements of a continuous subarray. This problem can be extended to allow to **update individual array elements**. If an element $a[i]$ changes, it's sufficient to update the value of $b[k]$ for the block to which this element belongs ($k = i / s$) in one operation:

    $$ b[k] += a_{new}[i] - a_{old}[i] $$

    On the other hand, the task of finding the sum of elements can be replaced with the task of finding minimal/maximal element of a subarray. If this problem has to address individual elements' updates as well, updating the value of $b[k]$ is also possible, but it will require iterating through all values of block $k$ in $O(s) = O(\sqrt{n})$ operations.

    Sqrt decomposition can be applied in a similar way to a whole class of other problems: finding the number of zero elements, finding the first non-zero element, counting elements which satisfy a certain property etc.

    Another class of problems appears when we need to **update array elements on intervals**: increment existing elements or replace them with a given value.

    For example, let's say we can do two types of operations on an array: add a given value $\delta$ to all array elements on interval $[l, r]$ or query the value of element $a[i]$. Let's store the value which has to be added to all elements of block $k$ in $b[k]$ (initially all $b[k] = 0$). During each "add" operation we need to add $\delta$ to $b[k]$ for all blocks which belong to interval $[l, r]$ and to add $\delta$ to $a[i]$ for all elements which belong to the "tails" of the interval. The answer a query $i$ is simply $a[i] + b[i/s]$. This way "add" operation has $O(\sqrt{n})$ complexity, and answering a query has $O(1)$ complexity.

    Finally, those two classes of problems can be combined if the task requires doing **both** element updates on an interval and queries on an interval. Both operations can be done with $O(\sqrt{n})$ complexity. This will require two block arrays $b$ and $c$: one to keep track of element updates and another to keep track of answers to the query.

    There exist other problems which can be solved using sqrt decomposition, for example, a problem about maintaining a set of numbers which would allow adding/deleting numbers, checking whether a number belongs to the set and finding $k$-th largest number. To solve it one has to store numbers in increasing order, split into several blocks with $\sqrt{n}$ numbers in each. Every time a number is added/deleted, the blocks have to be rebalanced by moving numbers between beginnings and ends of adjacent blocks.

    ## Mo's algorithm

    A similar idea, based on sqrt decomposition, can be used to answer range queries ($Q$) offline in $O((N+Q)\sqrt{N})$.
    This might sound like a lot worse than the methods in the previous section, since this is a slightly worse complexity than we had earlier and cannot update values between two queries.
    But in a lot of situations this method has advantages.
    During a normal sqrt decomposition, we have to precompute the answers for each block, and merge them during answering queries.
    In some problems this merging step can be quite problematic.
    E.g. when each queries asks to find the **mode** of its range (the number that appears the most often).
    For this each block would have to store the count of each number in it in some sort of data structure, and we cannot longer perform the merge step fast enough any more.
    **Mo's algorithm** uses a completely different approach, that can answer these kind of queries fast, because it only keeps track of one data structure, and the only operations with it are easy and fast.

    The idea is to answer the queries in a special order based on the indices.
    We will first answer all queries which have the left index in block 0, then answer all queries which have left index in block 1 and so on.
    And also we will have to answer the queries of a block is a special order, namely sorted by the right index of the queries.

    As already said we will use a single data structure.
    This data structure will store information about the range.
    At the beginning this range will be empty.
    When we want to answer the next query (in the special order), we simply extend or reduce the range, by adding/removing elements on both sides of the current range, until we transformed it into the query range.
    This way, we only need to add or remove a single element once at a time, which should be pretty easy operations in our data structure.

    Since we change the order of answering the queries, this is only possible when we are allowed to answer the queries in offline mode.

    ### Implementation

    In Mo's algorithm we use two functions for adding an index and for removing an index from the range which we are currently maintaining.

    ```cpp
    void remove(idx);  // TODO: remove value at idx from data structure
    void add(idx);     // TODO: add value at idx from data structure
    int get_answer();  // TODO: extract the current answer of the data structure

    int block_size;

    struct Query {
        int l, r, idx;
        bool operator<(Query other) const
        {
            return make_pair(l / block_size, r) <
                   make_pair(other.l / block_size, other.r);
        }
    };

    vector<int> mo_s_algorithm(vector<Query> queries) {
        vector<int> answers(queries.size());
        sort(queries.begin(), queries.end());

        // TODO: initialize data structure

        int cur_l = 0;
        int cur_r = -1;
        // invariant: data structure will always reflect the range [cur_l, cur_r]
        for (Query q : queries) {
            while (cur_l > q.l) {
                cur_l--;
                add(cur_l);
            }
            while (cur_r < q.r) {
                cur_r++;
                add(cur_r);
            }
            while (cur_l < q.l) {
                remove(cur_l);
                cur_l++;
            }
            while (cur_r > q.r) {
                remove(cur_r);
                cur_r--;
            }
            answers[q.idx] = get_answer();
        }
        return answers;
    }
