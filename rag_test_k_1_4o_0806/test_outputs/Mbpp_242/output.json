    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the total number of characters in that string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in `len()` function, which returns the number of characters in a string. This function will give us the total count of characters directly.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named count_charac that takes a single parameter, a string.\n   Use the len() function to get the number of characters in the string.\n   Return the result from the len() function.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_charac(s: str) -> int:\n    # Use the built-in len() function to count the number of characters in the string\n    return len(s)\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count and return the number of characters in the input string, as required by the problem statement.",
