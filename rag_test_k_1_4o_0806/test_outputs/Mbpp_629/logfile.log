INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/629 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function named `Split` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each number in the input list.
   - For each number, we will check if it is even. A number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.
   - If a number is even, we will add it to a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list of even numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function Split with parameter numbers (a list of integers)
       Initialize an empty list called even_numbers
       For each number in numbers
           If the number is even (number % 2 == 0)
               Append the number to even_numbers
       Return even_numbers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def Split(numbers):
    # Initialize an empty list to store even numbers
    even_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is even
        if number % 2 == 0:
            # If it is even, append it to the even_numbers list
            even_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the list of even numbers
    return even_numbers
```
