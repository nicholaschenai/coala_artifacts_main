INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/68 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given list of numbers is monotonic. A list is considered monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. In other words, the list should either be sorted in ascending order or descending order, or remain constant.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Monotonicity**: 
   - A list is non-decreasing if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
   - A list is non-increasing if each element is greater than or equal to the next element.
   
2. **Check Both Conditions**:
   - We will check if the list is non-decreasing.
   - We will also check if the list is non-increasing.
   - If either condition is true, the list is monotonic.

3. **Return Result**:
   - If the list satisfies either the non-decreasing or non-increasing condition, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_Monotonic(array):
    if array is empty or has one element:
        return True
    
    initialize two flags: is_non_decreasing and is_non_increasing to True
    
    for each index i from 0 to length of array - 2:
        if array[i] > array[i + 1]:
            set is_non_decreasing to False
        if array[i] < array[i + 1]:
            set is_non_increasing to False
    
    return is_non_decreasing or is_non_increasing
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_Monotonic(array):
    # An empty array or a single-element array is trivially monotonic
    if len(array) <= 1:
        return True
    
    # Initialize flags for non-decreasing and non-increasing
    is_non_decreasing = True
    is_non_increasing = True
    
    # Iterate through the array to check monotonicity
    for i in range(len(array) - 1):
        if array[i] > array[i + 1]:
            is_non_decreasing = False
        if array[i] < array[i + 1]:
            is_non_increasing = False
    
    # The array is monotonic if it is either non-decreasing or non-increasing
    return is_non_decreasing or is_non_increasing
```

This solution efficiently checks the monotonicity of the array by iterating through it once, making it O(n) in time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array.

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 1/2
    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum

    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).

    ## Problem statement

    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:

    $$ \max_{ 1 \le l \le r \le n } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.
    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.

    ## Algorithm 1

    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm is very simple.

    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.

    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.

    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.

    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.

    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.

    ### Implementation

    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ â€” we will only need the current element from it.

    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.

    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);
        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);
    }
    ```

    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        int cur = sum - min_sum;
        if (cur > ans) {
            ans = cur;
            ans_l = min_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = sum;
            min_pos = r;
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Algorithm 2

    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.

    **Proof:**

    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum â€” so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.

    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.

    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a "critical" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.

    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.

    ### Implementation

    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum);
        sum = max(sum, 0);
    }
    ```

    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        if (sum > ans) {
            ans = sum;
            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < 0) {
            sum = 0;
            minus_pos = r;
        }
    }

   We need to determine if a given list of numbers is monotonic. A list is considered monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To check if a list is monotonic, we can iterate through the list and check two conditions:
   - If the list is non-decreasing: Each element should be less than or equal to the next element.
   - If the list is non-increasing: Each element should be greater than or equal to the next element.
   
   If either of these conditions holds true for the entire list, then the list is monotonic.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function is_Monotonic(arr):
       Initialize two boolean variables: is_non_decreasing and is_non_increasing to True
       
       Loop through the list from the first element to the second last element:
           If the current element is greater than the next element:
               Set is_non_decreasing to False
           If the current element is less than the next element:
               Set is_non_increasing to False
       
       Return True if either is_non_decreasing or is_non_increasing is True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
