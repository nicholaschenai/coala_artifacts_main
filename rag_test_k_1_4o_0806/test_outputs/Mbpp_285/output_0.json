    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given string contains the character 'a' followed by either two or three 'b' characters. The function should return `True` if such a pattern exists in the string, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and look for the character 'a'. Once we find an 'a', we need to check the next two or three characters to see if they are all 'b'. If we find such a sequence, we return `True`. If we finish checking the entire string without finding the pattern, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function text_match_two_three(s):\n       for each index i from 0 to length of s - 1:\n           if s[i] is 'a':\n               if the next two characters (s[i+1] and s[i+2]) are 'b':\n                   return True\n               if the next three characters (s[i+1], s[i+2], and s[i+3]) are 'b':\n                   return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef text_match_two_three(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Check if the current character is 'a'\n        if s[i] == 'a':\n            # Check if the next two characters are 'b'\n            if i + 2 < len(s) and s[i+1] == 'b' and s[i+2] == 'b':\n                return True\n            # Check if the next three characters are 'b'\n            if i + 3 < len(s) and s[i+1] == 'b' and s[i+2] == 'b' and s[i+3] == 'b':\n                return True\n    # If no pattern is found, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the string, checking for the specified pattern of 'a' followed by two or three 'b's, and returns `True` if such a pattern is found. If the loop completes without finding the pattern, it returns `False`.",
