    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with all characters at odd indices removed. For example, given the string \"python\", the function should return \"yhn\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate over the input string and collect characters that are located at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.). We will then join these characters together to form the resulting string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define a function remove_odd that takes a string s as input\n       Initialize an empty list to store characters at even indices\n       For each index i and character c in the string s\n           If the index i is even\n               Append the character c to the list\n       Join the characters in the list to form the result string\n       Return the result string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_odd(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store characters at even indices\n    even_index_chars = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the string with index\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        # Check if the index is even\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # Append the character to the list if the index is even\n            even_index_chars.append(c)\n    \n    # Join the characters in the list to form the result string\n    result = ''.join(even_index_chars)\n    \n    # Return the result string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `remove_odd` which processes the input string `s` and returns a new string containing only the characters at even indices.",
