    "raw_msg": "Let's correct the solution based on the feedback and the problem requirements. The task is to remove characters at odd indices from the input string. The initial solution was incorrect because it removed characters at even indices instead. Here's the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef remove_odd(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store characters at even indices\n    even_index_chars = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the string with index\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        # Check if the index is even\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # Append the character to the list if the index is even\n            even_index_chars.append(c)\n    \n    # Join the characters in the list to form the result string\n    result = ''.join(even_index_chars)\n    \n    # Return the result string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code now correctly retains characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) and removes those at odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.), which aligns with the expected output for the test case.",
