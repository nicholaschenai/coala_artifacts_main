    "raw_msg": "Let's revisit the problem and the solution to identify the mistake:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to remove characters at odd indices from the input string. This means we should keep characters at indices 0, 2, 4, etc., and remove characters at indices 1, 3, 5, etc.\n\n2. **Reviewing the Solution:**\n   - The current solution is designed to keep characters at even indices, which is correct according to the problem statement.\n   - However, the test case provided in the feedback suggests that the expected output is \"yhn\" for the input \"python\", which implies that the characters at indices 1, 3, and 5 should be kept.\n\n3. **Identifying the Mistake:**\n   - The mistake is in the interpretation of the problem. The solution is correct in terms of logic, but the expected output in the test case suggests a different interpretation.\n   - The test case expects the function to keep characters at indices 1, 3, 5, etc., which are considered \"odd\" in the context of the test case.\n\n4. **Correcting the Solution:**\n   - We need to adjust the solution to keep characters at indices 1, 3, 5, etc., which are considered \"odd\" in the context of the test case.\n\nLet's update the solution to match the expected output:\n\n```python\ndef remove_odd(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store characters at odd indices\n    odd_index_chars = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the string with index\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        # Check if the index is odd\n        if i % 2 != 0:\n            # Append the character to the list if the index is odd\n            odd_index_chars.append(c)\n    \n    # Join the characters in the list to form the result string\n    result = ''.join(odd_index_chars)\n    \n    # Return the result string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis updated solution now correctly keeps characters at odd indices, which aligns with the expected output of the test case.",
