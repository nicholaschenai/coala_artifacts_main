The order of elements in the output list does not matter, and there should be no duplicates in the output.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the common elements between two lists, we can convert each list to a set. Sets in Python automatically handle duplicates and allow for efficient operations like intersection. By finding the intersection of the two sets, we can easily determine which elements are shared between the two lists. Finally, we convert the resulting set back to a list to match the expected output type.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function similar_elements that takes two lists as input\n       Convert the first list to a set\n       Convert the second list to a set\n       Find the intersection of the two sets\n       Convert the intersection set to a list\n       Return the list of common elements\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef similar_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Convert the first list to a set to remove duplicates and allow set operations\n    set1 = set(list1)\n    # Convert the second list to a set\n    set2 = set(list2)\n    # Find the intersection of the two sets to get common elements\n    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)\n    # Convert the set of common elements back to a list\n    return list(common_elements)\n```"
