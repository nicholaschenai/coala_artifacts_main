    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the count of positive numbers in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the list. For each number, we will check if it is greater than zero. If it is, we will increase our count of positive numbers by one. After checking all the numbers in the list, we will return the count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function pos_count(numbers):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is greater than 0:\n               increment count by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef pos_count(numbers):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of positive numbers\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is positive\n        if number > 0:\n            # Increment the counter if the number is positive\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of positive numbers\n    return count\n```",
