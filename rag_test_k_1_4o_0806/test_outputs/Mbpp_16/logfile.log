INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/16 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string consists of sequences of lowercase letters separated by underscores. If the string matches this pattern, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each character in the string.
   - We will check if the string contains only lowercase letters and underscores.
   - We will ensure that underscores are not at the start or end of the string and that they are not consecutive.
   - If all these conditions are met, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function text_lowercase_underscore(s):
       If the string is empty, return False
       If the first or last character is an underscore, return False
       Initialize a variable to track if the previous character was an underscore
       For each character in the string:
           If the character is not a lowercase letter and not an underscore, return False
           If the character is an underscore:
               If the previous character was also an underscore, return False
               Set the previous character as underscore
           Else:
               Set the previous character as not underscore
       Return True
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_lowercase_underscore(s: str) -> bool:
    # If the string is empty, it cannot match the pattern
    if not s:
        return False
    
    # If the first or last character is an underscore, return False
    if s[0] == '_' or s[-1] == '_':
        return False
    
    # Initialize a variable to track if the previous character was an underscore
    previous_was_underscore = False
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # If the character is not a lowercase letter and not an underscore, return False
        if not (char.islower() or char == '_'):
            return False
        
        # If the character is an underscore
        if char == '_':
            # If the previous character was also an underscore, return False
            if previous_was_underscore:
                return False
            # Set the previous character as underscore
            previous_was_underscore = True
        else:
            # Set the previous character as not underscore
            previous_was_underscore = False
    
    # If all checks are passed, return True
    return True

    Title: Balanced bracket sequences
    Part: 1/2
    # Balanced bracket sequences

    A **balanced bracket sequence** is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence, when inserted certain numbers and mathematical operations, gives a valid mathematical expression.
    Formally you can define balanced bracket sequence with:

    - $e$ (the empty string) is a balanced bracket sequence.
    - if $s$ is a balanced bracket sequence, then so is $(s)$.
    - if $s$ and $t$ are balanced bracket sequences, then so is $s t$.

    For instance $(())()$ is a balanced bracket sequence, but $())($ is not.

    Of course you can define other bracket sequences also with multiple bracket types in a similar fashion.

    In this article we discuss some classic problems involving balanced bracket sequences (for simplicity we will only call them sequences): validation, number of sequences, finding the lexicographical next sequence, generating all sequences of a certain size, finding the index of sequence, and generating the $k$-th sequences.
    We will also discuss two variations for the problems, the simpler version when only one type of brackets is allowed, and the harder case when there are multiple types.

    ## Balance validation

    We want to check if a given string is balanced or not.

    At first suppose there is only one type of bracket.
    For this case there exists a very simple algorithm.
    Let $\text{depth}$ be the current number of open brackets.
    Initially $\text{depth} = 0$.
    We iterate over all character of the string, if the current bracket character is an opening bracket, then we increment $\text{depth}$, otherwise we decrement it.
    If at any time the variable $\text{depth}$ gets negative, or at the end it is different from $0$, then the string is not a balanced sequence.
    Otherwise it is.

    If there are several bracket types involved, then the algorithm needs to be changes.
    Instead of a counter $\text{depth}$ we create a stack, in which we will store all opening brackets that we meet.
    If the current bracket character is an opening one, we put it onto the stack.
    If it is a closing one, then we check if the stack is non-empty, and if the top element of the stack is of the same type as the current closing bracket.
    If both conditions are fulfilled, then we remove the opening bracket from the stack.
    If at any time one of the conditions is not fulfilled, or at the end the stack is not empty, then the string is not balanced.
    Otherwise it is.

    ## Number of balanced sequences

    ### Formula

    The number of balanced bracket sequences with only one bracket type can be calculated using the [Catalan numbers](catalan-numbers.md).
    The number of balanced bracket sequences of length $2n$ ($n$ pairs of brackets) is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$$

    If we allow $k$ types of brackets, then each pair be of any of the $k$ types (independently of the others), thus the number of balanced bracket sequences is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} k^n$$

    ### Dynamic programming

    On the other hand these numbers can be computed using **dynamic programming**.
    Let $d[n]$ be the number of regular bracket sequences with $n$ pairs of bracket.
    Note that in the first position there is always an opening bracket.
    And somewhere later is the corresponding closing bracket of the pair.
    It is clear that inside this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence, and similarly after this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence.
    So to compute $d[n]$, we will look at how many balanced sequences of $i$ pairs of brackets are inside this first bracket pair, and how many balanced sequences with $n-1-i$ pairs are after this pair.
    Consequently the formula has the form:

    $$d[n] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d[i] \cdot d[n-1-i]$$

    The initial value for this recurrence is $d[0] = 1$.

    ## Finding the lexicographical next balanced sequence

    Here we only consider the case with one valid bracket type.

    Given a balanced sequence, we have to find the next (in lexicographical order) balanced sequence.

    It should be obvious, that we have to find the rightmost opening bracket, which we can replace by a closing bracket without violation the condition, that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets up to this position.
    After replacing this position, we can fill the remaining part of the string with the lexicographically minimal one: i.e. first with as much opening brackets as possible, and then fill up the remaining positions with closing brackets.
    In other words we try to leave a long as possible prefix unchanged, and the suffix gets replaced by the lexicographically minimal one.

    To find this position, we can iterate over the character from right to left, and maintain the balance $\text{depth}$ of open and closing brackets.
    When we meet an opening brackets, we will decrement $\text{depth}$, and when we meet a closing bracket, we increase it.
    If we are at some point meet an opening bracket, and the balance after processing this symbol is positive, then we have found the rightmost position that we can change.
    We change the symbol, compute the number of opening and closing brackets that we have to add to the right side, and arrange them in the lexicographically minimal way.

    If we find do suitable position, then this sequence is already the maximal possible one, and there is no answer.

    ```{.cpp file=next_balanced_brackets_sequence}
    bool next_balanced_sequence(string & s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '(')
                depth--;
            else
                depth++;

            if (s[i] == '(' && depth > 0) {
                depth--;
                int open = (n - i - 1 - depth) / 2;
                int close = n - i - 1 - open;
                string next = s.substr(0, i) + ')' + string(open, '(') + string(close, ')');
                s.swap(next);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
