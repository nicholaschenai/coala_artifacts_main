    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if each element in the second tuple is smaller than the corresponding element in the first tuple. If all elements in the second tuple are smaller than their counterparts in the first tuple, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of elements (one from the first tuple and one from the second tuple), we will check if the element from the second tuple is smaller than the element from the first tuple.\n   - If we find any element in the second tuple that is not smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple, we will return `False`.\n   - If we complete the iteration without finding any such element, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n       for each index i in range of length of tuple1:\n           if tuple2[i] is not smaller than tuple1[i]:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_smaller(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> bool:\n    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Check if the element in the second tuple is not smaller than the element in the first tuple\n        if tuple2[i] >= tuple1[i]:\n            # If any element in the second tuple is not smaller, return False\n            return False\n    # If all elements in the second tuple are smaller, return True\n    return True\n```",
