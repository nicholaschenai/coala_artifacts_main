INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/766 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of items and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain a pair of consecutive items from the input list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input list and for each element (except the last one), create a tuple with the current element and the next element. We will collect all these tuples in a new list and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function named pair_wise that takes a list as input.
   Initialize an empty list called result to store the pairs.
   Loop through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element:
       Create a tuple with the current element and the next element.
       Append this tuple to the result list.
   Return the result list.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def pair_wise(lst):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the pairs
    result = []
    
    # Loop through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        # Create a tuple with the current element and the next element
        pair = (lst[i], lst[i + 1])
        
        # Append this tuple to the result list
        result.append(pair)
    
    # Return the result list containing all pairs
    return result
```

This function will iterate through the list, create pairs of consecutive elements, and return a list of these pairs.

    Title: Finding the nearest pair of points
    Part: 3/3
    ```

    For a convenient implementation of recursion, we introduce an auxiliary function upd_ans(), which will calculate the distance between two points and check whether it is better than the current answer:

    ```{.cpp file=nearest_pair_update}
    double mindist;
    pair<int, int> best_pair;
 
    void upd_ans(const pt & a, const pt & b) {
        double dist = sqrt((a.x - b.x)*(a.x - b.x) + (a.y - b.y)*(a.y - b.y));
        if (dist < mindist) {
            mindist = dist;
            best_pair = {a.id, b.id};
        }
    }
    ```

    Finally, the implementation of the recursion itself. It is assumed that before calling it, the array $a[]$ is already sorted by $x$-coordinate. In recursion we pass just two pointers $l, r$, which indicate that it should look for the answer for $a[l \ldots r)$. If the distance between $r$ and $l$ is too small, the recursion must be stopped, and perform a trivial algorithm to find the nearest pair and then sort the subarray by $y$-coordinate.

    To merge two sets of points received from recursive calls into one (ordered by $y$-coordinate), we use the standard STL $merge()$ function, and create an auxiliary buffer $t[]$(one for all recursive calls). (Using inplace_merge () is impractical because it generally does not work in linear time.)

    Finally, the set $B$ is stored in the same array $t$.

    ```{.cpp file=nearest_pair_rec}
    vector<pt> t;

    void rec(int l, int r) {
        if (r - l <= 3) {
            for (int i = l; i < r; ++i) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < r; ++j) {
                    upd_ans(a[i], a[j]);
                }
            }
            sort(a.begin() + l, a.begin() + r, cmp_y());
            return;
        }

        int m = (l + r) >> 1;
        int midx = a[m].x;
        rec(l, m);
        rec(m, r);

        merge(a.begin() + l, a.begin() + m, a.begin() + m, a.begin() + r, t.begin(), cmp_y());
        copy(t.begin(), t.begin() + r - l, a.begin() + l);

        int tsz = 0;
        for (int i = l; i < r; ++i) {
            if (abs(a[i].x - midx) < mindist) {
                for (int j = tsz - 1; j >= 0 && a[i].y - t[j].y < mindist; --j)
                    upd_ans(a[i], t[j]);
                t[tsz++] = a[i];
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    By the way, if all the coordinates are integer, then at the time of the recursion you can not move to fractional values, and store in $mindist$ the square of the minimum distance.

    In the main program, recursion should be called as follows:

    ```{.cpp file=nearest_pair_main}
    t.resize(n);
    sort(a.begin(), a.end(), cmp_x());
    mindist = 1E20;
    rec(0, n);
    ```

    ## Generalization: finding a triangle with minimal perimeter

    The algorithm described above is interestingly generalized to this problem: among a given set of points, choose three different points so that the sum of pairwise distances between them is the smallest.

    In fact, to solve this problem, the algorithm remains the same: we divide the field into two halves of the vertical line, call the solution recursively on both halves, choose the minimum $minper$ from the found perimeters, build a strip with the thickness of $minper / 2$, and iterate through all triangles that can improve the answer. (Note that the triangle with perimeter $\le minper$ has the longest side $\le minper / 2$.)
