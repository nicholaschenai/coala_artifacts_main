It is assumed that before calling it, the array $a[]$ is already sorted by $x$-coordinate. In recursion we pass just two pointers $l, r$, which indicate that it should look for the answer for $a[l \\ldots r)$. If the distance between $r$ and $l$ is too small, the recursion must be stopped, and perform a trivial algorithm to find the nearest pair and then sort the subarray by $y$-coordinate.\n\n    To merge two sets of points received from recursive calls into one (ordered by $y$-coordinate), we use the standard STL $merge()$ function, and create an auxiliary buffer $t[]$(one for all recursive calls). (Using inplace_merge () is impractical because it generally does not work in linear time.)\n\n    Finally, the set $B$ is stored in the same array $t$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=nearest_pair_rec}\n    vector<pt> t;\n\n    void rec(int l, int r) {\n        if (r - l <= 3) {\n            for (int i = l; i < r; ++i) {\n                for (int j = i + 1; j < r; ++j) {\n                    upd_ans(a[i], a[j]);\n                }\n            }\n            sort(a.begin() + l, a.begin() + r, cmp_y());\n            return;\n        }\n\n        int m = (l + r) >> 1;\n        int midx = a[m].x;\n        rec(l, m);\n        rec(m, r);\n\n        merge(a.begin() + l, a.begin() + m, a.begin() + m, a.begin() + r, t.begin(), cmp_y());\n        copy(t.begin(), t.begin() + r - l, a.begin() + l);\n\n        int tsz = 0;\n        for (int i = l; i < r; ++i) {\n            if (abs(a[i].x - midx) < mindist) {\n                for (int j = tsz - 1; j >= 0 && a[i].y - t[j].y < mindist; --j)\n                    upd_ans(a[i], t[j]);\n                t[tsz++] = a[i];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    By the way, if all the coordinates are integer, then at the time of the recursion you can not move to fractional values, and store in $mindist$ the square of the minimum distance.\n\n    In the main program, recursion should be called as follows:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=nearest_pair_main}\n    t.resize(n);\n    sort(a.begin(), a.end(), cmp_x());\n    mindist = 1E20;\n    rec(0, n);\n    ```\n\n    ## Generalization: finding a triangle with minimal perimeter\n\n    The algorithm described above is interestingly generalized to this problem: among a given set of points, choose three different points so that the sum of pairwise distances between them is the smallest.\n\n    In fact, to solve this problem, the algorithm remains the same: we divide the field into two halves of the vertical line, call the solution recursively on both halves, choose the minimum $minper$ from the found perimeters, build a strip with the thickness of $minper / 2$, and iterate through all triangles that can improve the answer. (Note that the triangle with perimeter $\\le minper$ has the longest side $\\le minper / 2$.)\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
