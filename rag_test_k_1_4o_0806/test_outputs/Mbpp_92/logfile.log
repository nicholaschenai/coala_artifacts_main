INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/92 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to determine if a given number is "undulating." A number is considered undulating if its digits alternate between two distinct values. For example, the number 1212121 is undulating because it alternates between the digits 1 and 2.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.
   - Check if the number has at least two digits, as a single-digit number cannot be undulating.
   - Identify the first two digits and ensure they are different.
   - Iterate through the number, checking that each digit alternates between the first two digits.
   - If all conditions are met, the number is undulating; otherwise, it is not.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Convert the number to a string
   If the length of the string is less than 2, return False
   Get the first two digits
   If the first two digits are the same, return False
   For each digit starting from the third one:
       Check if it alternates correctly with the previous digit
       If not, return False
   If all checks pass, return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_undulating(n: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit
    num_str = str(n)
    
    # If the number has less than 2 digits, it cannot be undulating
    if len(num_str) < 2:
        return False
    
    # Get the first two digits
    first_digit = num_str[0]
    second_digit = num_str[1]
    
    # If the first two digits are the same, it cannot be undulating
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    
    # Iterate through the number starting from the third digit
    for i in range(2, len(num_str)):
        # Check if the current digit alternates correctly with the previous one
        if num_str[i] != num_str[i - 2]:
            return False
    
    # If all checks pass, the number is undulating
    return True
```
This solution checks if a number is undulating by ensuring that its digits alternate between two distinct values. It handles edge cases like single-digit numbers and numbers where the first two digits are the same.
