For example, the number 1212121 is undulating because it alternates between the digits 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.\n   - Check if the number has at least two digits, as a single-digit number cannot be undulating.\n   - Identify the first two digits and ensure they are different.\n   - Iterate through the number, checking that each digit alternates between the first two digits.\n   - If all conditions are met, the number is undulating; otherwise, it is not.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Convert the number to a string\n   If the length of the string is less than 2, return False\n   Get the first two digits\n   If the first two digits are the same, return False\n   For each digit starting from the third one:\n       Check if it alternates correctly with the previous digit\n       If not, return False\n   If all checks pass, return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_undulating(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit\n    num_str = str(n)\n    \n    # If the number has less than 2 digits, it cannot be undulating\n    if len(num_str) < 2:\n        return False\n    \n    # Get the first two digits\n    first_digit = num_str[0]\n    second_digit = num_str[1]\n    \n    # If the first two digits are the same, it cannot be undulating\n    if first_digit == second_digit:\n        return False\n    \n    # Iterate through the number starting from the third digit\n    for i in range(2, len(num_str)):\n        # Check if the current digit alternates correctly with the previous one\n        if num_str[i] != num_str[i - 2]:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all checks pass, the number is undulating\n    return True\n```\nThis solution checks if a number is undulating by ensuring that its digits alternate between two distinct values. It handles edge cases like single-digit numbers and numbers where the first two digits are the same."
