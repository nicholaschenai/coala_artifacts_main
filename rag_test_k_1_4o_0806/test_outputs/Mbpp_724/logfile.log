INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/724 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function `power_base_sum` that takes two arguments: `base` and `power`. The function should compute the result of raising `base` to the `power`, and then return the sum of all the digits in this result.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Calculate the Power**: First, compute the result of raising `base` to the `power`.
2. **Convert to String**: Convert the resulting number to a string so that we can easily iterate over each digit.
3. **Sum the Digits**: Convert each character back to an integer and sum them up.
4. **Return the Sum**: Return the computed sum of the digits.

### Pseudocode

```
function power_base_sum(base, power):
    result = base raised to the power
    convert result to string
    initialize sum_of_digits to 0
    for each character in the string representation of result:
        convert character to integer
        add integer to sum_of_digits
    return sum_of_digits
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def power_base_sum(base: int, power: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Calculate the power
    result = base ** power
    
    # Step 2: Convert the result to a string
    result_str = str(result)
    
    # Step 3: Initialize the sum of digits
    sum_of_digits = 0
    
    # Step 4: Sum the digits
    for char in result_str:
        sum_of_digits += int(char)
    
    # Step 5: Return the sum of the digits
    return sum_of_digits
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of the digits of `base` raised to the `power`, as required by the problem statement.
