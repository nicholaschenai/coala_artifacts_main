INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/128 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and a string of words. The function should return a list of words from the string that have more than `n` characters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Split the input string into individual words.
   - Iterate over each word and check its length.
   - If a word's length is greater than `n`, add it to a result list.
   - Return the list of words that are longer than `n` characters.

3. **Pseudocode:**
   ```
   function long_words(n, sentence):
       split the sentence into a list of words
       initialize an empty list called result
       for each word in the list of words:
           if the length of the word is greater than n:
               append the word to the result list
       return the result list
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution:**

```python
def long_words(n: int, sentence: str) -> list:
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    # Initialize an empty list to store words longer than n
    result = []
    # Iterate over each word in the list
    for word in words:
        # Check if the word's length is greater than n
        if len(word) > n:
            # Add the word to the result list
            result.append(word)
    # Return the list of words longer than n
    return result
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and adheres to the problem requirements. It splits the input sentence into words, checks each word's length, and collects those that are longer than `n` into a list, which is then returned.

    \index{longest increasing subsequence}

    Our first problem is to find the
    \key{longest increasing subsequence}
    in an array of $n$ elements.
    This is a maximum-length
    sequence of array elements
    that goes from left to right,
    and each element in the sequence is larger
    than the previous element.
    For example, in the array

    the longest increasing subsequence
    contains 4 elements:

    Let $\texttt{length}(k)$ denote
    the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position $k$.
    Thus, if we calculate all values of
    $\texttt{length}(k)$ where $0 \le k \le n-1$,
    we will find out the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence.
    For example, the values of the function
    for the above array are as follows:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{length}(0) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(4) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{length}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(6) & = & 4 \\
    \texttt{length}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{length}(6)=4$,
    because the longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position 6 consists of 4 elements.

    To calculate a value of $\texttt{length}(k)$,
    we should find a position $i<k$
    for which $\texttt{array}[i]<\texttt{array}[k]$
    and $\texttt{length}(i)$ is as large as possible.
    Then we know that
    $\texttt{length}(k)=\texttt{length}(i)+1$,
    because this is an optimal way to add
    $\texttt{array}[k]$ to a subsequence.
    However, if there is no such position $i$,
    then $\texttt{length}(k)=1$,
    which means that the subsequence only contains
    $\texttt{array}[k]$.

    Since all values of the function can be calculated
    from its smaller values,
    we can use dynamic programming.
    In the following code, the values
    of the function will be stored in an array
    $\texttt{length}$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        length[k] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (array[i] < array[k]) {
                length[k] = max(length[k],length[i]+1);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    This code works in $O(n^2)$ time,
    because it consists of two nested loops.
    However, it is also possible to implement
    the dynamic programming calculation
    more efficiently in $O(n \log n)$ time.
    Can you find a way to do this?

   ```
   function long_words(n, sentence):
       split the sentence into a list of words
