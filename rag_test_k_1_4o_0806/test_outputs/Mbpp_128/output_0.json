    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a number `n` and a string of words separated by spaces. The function should return a list of words from the string that have more than `n` characters.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, split the input string into individual words.\n   - Then, iterate over each word and check its length.\n   - If a word's length is greater than `n`, add it to a list of results.\n   - Finally, return the list of words that are longer than `n` characters.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function long_words(n, sentence):\n       split the sentence into a list of words\n       initialize an empty list called result\n       for each word in the list of words:\n           if the length of the word is greater than n:\n               add the word to the result list\n       return the result list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef long_words(n: int, sentence: str) -> list:\n    # Split the sentence into a list of words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store words longer than n\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the length of the word is greater than n\n        if len(word) > n:\n            # Add the word to the result list\n            result.append(word)\n    \n    # Return the list of words longer than n\n    return result\n```",
