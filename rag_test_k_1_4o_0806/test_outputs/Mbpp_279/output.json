    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth decagonal number. A decagonal number is a figurate number that represents a decagon. The formula for the nth decagonal number is given by: \n   \\[\n   D_n = 4n^2 - 3n\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the position in the sequence.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth decagonal number, we can directly use the formula \\( D_n = 4n^2 - 3n \\). This formula allows us to compute the decagonal number for any given positive integer \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function is_num_decagonal(n):\n       Calculate decagonal number using the formula: 4 * n * n - 3 * n\n       Return the calculated decagonal number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_num_decagonal(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth decagonal number using the formula: 4n^2 - 3n\n    decagonal_number = 4 * n * n - 3 * n\n    # Return the calculated decagonal number\n    return decagonal_number\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer \\( n \\) as input and returns the nth decagonal number by applying the formula \\( 4n^2 - 3n \\).",
