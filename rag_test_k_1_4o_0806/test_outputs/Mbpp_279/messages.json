Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the nth decagonal number. A decagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the decagon (a ten-sided polygon). The formula for the nth decagonal number is given by:\n\n\\[ D_n = 4n^2 - 3n \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the position in the sequence.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo find the nth decagonal number:\n- Use the formula \\( D_n = 4n^2 - 3n \\).\n- Substitute the given \\( n \\) into this formula to compute the decagonal number.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction is_num_decagonal(n):\n    calculate decagonal_number using the formula 4 * n^2 - 3 * n\n    return decagonal_number\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef is_num_decagonal(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth decagonal number using the formula\n    # D_n = 4n^2 - 3n\n    decagonal_number = 4 * n * n - 3 * n\n    return decagonal_number\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth decagonal number by applying the formula \\( D_n = 4n^2 - 3n \\)."
