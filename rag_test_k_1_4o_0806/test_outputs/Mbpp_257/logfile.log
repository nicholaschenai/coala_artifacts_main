INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/257 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple. The tuple should contain the second number first and the first number second.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The function will accept two parameters, which are numbers.
   - We will create a tuple where the first element is the second parameter and the second element is the first parameter.
   - Finally, we will return this tuple.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `swap_numbers` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
   - Inside the function, create a tuple with the elements in the order `(b, a)`.
   - Return the created tuple.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def swap_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> tuple:
    # Create a tuple with the second number first and the first number second
    result = (b, a)
    # Return the tuple
    return result
```

This function will take two integers as input and return a tuple with the second integer first and the first integer second, as required by the problem statement.

    Title: Linear Diophantine Equation
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    Once we have $l_x$ and $r_x$, it is also simple to enumerate through all the solutions. Just need to iterate through $x = l_x + k \cdot \frac{b}{g}$ for all $k \ge 0$ until $x = r_x$, and find the corresponding $y$ values using the equation $a x + b y = c$.

    ## Find the solution with minimum value of $x + y$ { data-toc-label='Find the solution with minimum value of <script type="math/tex">x + y</script>' }

    Here, $x$ and $y$ also need to be given some restriction, otherwise, the answer may become negative infinity.

    The idea is similar to previous section: We find any solution of the Diophantine equation, and then shift the solution to satisfy some conditions.

    Finally, use the knowledge of the set of all solutions to find the minimum:

    $$x' = x + k \cdot \frac{b}{g},$$

    $$y' = y - k \cdot \frac{a}{g}.$$

    Note that $x + y$ change as follows:

    $$x' + y' = x + y + k \cdot \left(\frac{b}{g} - \frac{a}{g}\right) = x + y + k \cdot \frac{b-a}{g}$$

    If $a < b$, we need to select smallest possible value of $k$. If $a > b$, we need to select the largest possible value of $k$. If $a = b$, all solution will have the same sum $x + y$.
