This means that if the inputs are `a` and `b`, the output should be `(b, a)`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named swap_numbers that takes two parameters, num1 and num2.\n   Return a tuple with num2 as the first element and num1 as the second element.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef swap_numbers(num1: int, num2: int) -> tuple:\n    # Return a tuple with the second number first and the first number second\n    return (num2, num1)\n```",
