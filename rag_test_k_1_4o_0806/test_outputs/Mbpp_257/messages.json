The tuple should contain the second number first and the first number second.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The function will accept two parameters, which are numbers.\n   - We will create a tuple where the first element is the second parameter and the second element is the first parameter.\n   - Finally, we will return this tuple.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `swap_numbers` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n   - Inside the function, create a tuple with the elements in the order `(b, a)`.\n   - Return the created tuple.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef swap_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> tuple:\n    # Create a tuple with the second number first and the first number second\n    result = (b, a)\n    # Return the tuple\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take two integers as input and return a tuple with the second integer first and the first integer second, as required by the problem statement."

Just need to iterate through $x = l_x + k \\cdot \\frac{b}{g}$ for all $k \\ge 0$ until $x = r_x$, and find the corresponding $y$ values using the equation $a x + b y = c$.\n\n    ## Find the solution with minimum value of $x + y$ { data-toc-label='Find the solution with minimum value of <script type=\"math/tex\">x + y</script>' }\n\n    Here, $x$ and $y$ also need to be given some restriction, otherwise, the answer may become negative infinity.\n\n    The idea is similar to previous section: We find any solution of the Diophantine equation, and then shift the solution to satisfy some conditions.\n\n    Finally, use the knowledge of the set of all solutions to find the minimum:\n\n    $$x' = x + k \\cdot \\frac{b}{g},$$\n\n    $$y' = y - k \\cdot \\frac{a}{g}.$$\n\n    Note that $x + y$ change as follows:\n\n    $$x' + y' = x + y + k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{b}{g} - \\frac{a}{g}\\right) = x + y + k \\cdot \\frac{b-a}{g}$$\n\n    If $a < b$, we need to select smallest possible value of $k$. If $a > b$, we need to select the largest possible value of $k$. If $a = b$, all solution will have the same sum $x + y$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
