INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/456 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list where each string is reversed.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each string in the input list.
   - For each string, we will reverse it.
   - We will collect all the reversed strings into a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list of reversed strings.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `reverse_string_list` that takes a list of strings as input.
   - Initialize an empty list `reversed_list` to store the reversed strings.
   - For each string `s` in the input list:
     - Reverse the string `s` using slicing (`s[::-1]`).
     - Append the reversed string to `reversed_list`.
   - Return `reversed_list`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def reverse_string_list(strings: list) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the reversed strings
    reversed_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each string in the input list
    for s in strings:
        # Reverse the string using slicing and append to the reversed_list
        reversed_list.append(s[::-1])
    
    # Return the list of reversed strings
    return reversed_list
```

This function will take a list of strings, reverse each string, and return a new list containing the reversed strings.

    Title: Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$
    Part: 1/2
    # Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$

    ## Statement

    Given string $s$ with length $n$. Find all the pairs $(i, j)$ such that substring $s[i\dots j]$ is a palindrome. String $t$ is a palindrome when $t = t_{rev}$ ($t_{rev}$ is a reversed string for $t$).

    ## More precise statement

    In the worst case string might have up to $O(n^2)$ palindromic substrings, and at the first glance it seems that there is no linear algorithm for this problem.

    But the information about the palindromes can be kept **in a compact way**: for each position $i$ we will find the number of non-empty palindromes centered at this position.

    Palindromes with a common center form a contiguous chain, that is if we have a palindrome of length $l$ centered in $i$, we also have palindromes of lengths $l-2$, $l-4$ and so on also centered in $i$. Therefore, we will collect the information about all palindromic substrings in this way.

    Palindromes of odd and even lengths are accounted for separately as $d_{odd}[i]$ and $d_{even}[i]$. For the palindromes of even length we assume that they're centered in the position $i$ if their two central characters are $s[i]$ and $s[i-1]$.

    For instance, string $s = abababc$ has three palindromes with odd length with centers in the position $s[3] = b$, i. e. $d_{odd}[3] = 3$:

    $$a\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{b}_{s_3}\ a\ b}^{d_{odd}[3]=3} c$$

    And string $s = cbaabd$ has two palindromes with even length with centers in the position $s[3] = a$, i. e. $d_{even}[3] = 2$:

    $$c\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{a}_{s_3}\ b}^{d_{even}[3]=2} d$$

    It's a surprising fact that there is an algorithm, which is simple enough, that calculates these "palindromity arrays" $d_{odd}[]$ and $d_{even}[]$ in linear time. The algorithm is described in this article.

    ## Solution

    In general, this problem has many solutions: with [String Hashing](/string/string-hashing.html) it can be solved in $O(n\cdot \log n)$, and with [Suffix Trees](/string/suffix-tree-ukkonen.html) and fast LCA this problem can be solved in $O(n)$.

    But the method described here is **sufficiently** simpler and has less hidden constant in time and memory complexity. This algorithm was discovered by **Glenn K. Manacher** in 1975.

    Another modern way to solve this problem and to deal with palindromes in general is through the so-called palindromic tree, or eertree.

    ## Trivial algorithm

    To avoid ambiguities in the further description we denote what "trivial algorithm" is.

    It's the algorithm that does the following. For each center position $i$ it tries to increase the answer by one as long as it's possible, comparing a pair of corresponding characters each time.

    Such an algorithm is slow, it can calculate the answer only in $O(n^2)$.

    The implementation of the trivial algorithm is:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        s = "$" + s + "^";
        vector<int> p(n + 2);
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {
                p[i]++;
            }
        }
        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);
    }
