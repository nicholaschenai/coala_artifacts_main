        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a Python function that converts a complex number into its polar coordinate representation. The polar coordinate representation of a complex number consists of two values: the magnitude (or modulus) and the angle (or argument) in radians.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Magnitude Calculation**: The magnitude of a complex number \\( z = a + bi \\) is calculated using the formula \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n2. **Angle Calculation**: The angle (or argument) is calculated using the `atan2` function, which computes the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments, taking into account the signs of both arguments to determine the correct quadrant of the angle. For a complex number \\( z = a + bi \\), the angle is \\( \\text{atan2}(b, a) \\).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `convert` that takes a single argument `z`.\n2. Extract the real part `a` and the imaginary part `b` from the complex number `z`.\n3. Calculate the magnitude using the formula \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n4. Calculate the angle using the `atan2` function with `b` and `a` as arguments.\n5. Return a tuple containing the magnitude and the angle.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef convert(z: complex) -> tuple:\n    # Extract real and imaginary parts\n    a = z.real\n    b = z.imag\n    \n    # Calculate magnitude\n    magnitude = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)\n    \n    # Calculate angle\n    angle = math.atan2(b, a)\n    \n    # Return the polar coordinates as a tuple\n    return (magnitude, angle)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `convert` that takes a complex number `z` and returns its polar coordinates as a tuple. The magnitude is calculated using the square root of the sum of squares of the real and imaginary parts, and the angle is calculated using the `atan2` function to ensure the correct quadrant is considered."
