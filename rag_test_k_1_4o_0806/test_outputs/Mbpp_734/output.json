    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the products of all possible sublists (subarrays) of a given list of integers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to consider all possible sublists of the given list. For each sublist, we calculate the product of its elements and then sum up all these products. A sublist can be of any length, from 1 to the length of the list itself. We will iterate over all possible starting and ending indices to generate these sublists.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for each start index from 0 to length of arr - 1:\n           initialize product to 1\n           for each end index from start to length of arr - 1:\n               multiply product by arr[end]\n               add product to total_sum\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr):\n    # Initialize the total sum of products to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible starting index of the sublist\n    for start in range(len(arr)):\n        # Initialize the product for the current sublist\n        product = 1\n        \n        # Iterate over each possible ending index of the sublist\n        for end in range(start, len(arr)):\n            # Multiply the current element to the product\n            product *= arr[end]\n            \n            # Add the current product to the total sum\n            total_sum += product\n    \n    # Return the total sum of products of all sublists\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis code iterates over all possible sublists, calculates their products, and accumulates these products into a total sum, which is then returned.",
