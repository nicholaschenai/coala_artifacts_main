The function should return a list containing the `n`-th element from each tuple in the list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, we will extract the element at the index `n`.\n   - We will collect these elements into a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return this new list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function extract_nth_element with parameters list_of_tuples and n\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each tuple in list_of_tuples\n           Append the element at index n of the tuple to result\n       Return result\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_nth_element(list_of_tuples, n):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the nth elements\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for tuple_item in list_of_tuples:\n        # Append the nth element of the current tuple to the result list\n        result.append(tuple_item[n])\n    \n    # Return the list of nth elements\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly extract the `n`-th element from each tuple in the provided list and return a list of these elements."
