    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes two strings as input. The function should remove all characters from the first string that are present in the second string and return the modified first string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate over each character in the first string and check if it is present in the second string. If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, we add it to a new result string. Finally, we return this result string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   1. Define a function `remove_dirty_chars` that takes two strings `s1` and `s2`.\n   2. Create an empty string `result` to store the characters that are not in `s2`.\n   3. For each character `char` in `s1`:\n      a. If `char` is not in `s2`, append `char` to `result`.\n   4. Return the `result` string.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(s1: str, s2: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the first string\n    for char in s1:\n        # If the character is not in the second string, add it to the result\n        if char not in s2:\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the result string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each character in the first string and checks if it is present in the second string. If not, it appends the character to the result string. This approach ensures that all characters from the first string that are not in the second string are retained in the result.",
