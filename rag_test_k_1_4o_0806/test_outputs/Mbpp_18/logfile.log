INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/18 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes two strings as input. The function should remove all characters from the first string that are present in the second string. The result should be a new string containing only the characters from the first string that are not found in the second string.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Characters to Remove**: First, identify all the characters in the second string. These are the characters that need to be removed from the first string.
2. **Filter the First String**: Iterate through each character in the first string and check if it is present in the second string.
3. **Build the Result String**: If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, include it in the result string. Otherwise, skip it.
4. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters in the first string, return the result string.

## Pseudocode

```
function remove_dirty_chars(first_string, second_string):
    create an empty result string
    for each character in first_string:
        if character is not in second_string:
            append character to result string
    return result string
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def remove_dirty_chars(first_string: str, second_string: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to store the result
    result = ''
    
    # Iterate over each character in the first string
    for char in first_string:
        # Check if the character is not in the second string
        if char not in second_string:
            # If not, add it to the result string
            result += char
    
    # Return the final result string
    return result

    Title: String Hashing
    Part: 1/2
    # String Hashing

    Hashing algorithms are helpful in solving a lot of problems.

    We want to solve the problem of comparing strings efficiently.
    The brute force way of doing so is just to compare the letters of both strings, which has a time complexity of $O(\min(n_1, n_2))$ if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sizes of the two strings.
    We want to do better.
    The idea behind the string hashing is the following: we map each string into an integer and compare those instead of the strings.
    Doing this allows us to reduce the execution time of the string comparison to $O(1)$.

    For the conversion, we need a so-called **hash function**.
    The goal of it is to convert a string into an integer, the so-called **hash** of the string.
    The following condition has to hold: if two strings $s$ and $t$ are equal ($s = t$), then also their hashes have to be equal ($\text{hash}(s) = \text{hash}(t)$).
    Otherwise, we will not be able to compare strings.

    Notice, the opposite direction doesn't have to hold.
    If the hashes are equal ($\text{hash}(s) = \text{hash}(t)$), then the strings do not necessarily have to be equal.
    E.g. a valid hash function would be simply $\text{hash}(s) = 0$ for each $s$.
    Now, this is just a stupid example, because this function will be completely useless, but it is a valid hash function.
    The reason why the opposite direction doesn't have to hold, is because there are exponentially many strings.
    If we only want this hash function to distinguish between all strings consisting of lowercase characters of length smaller than 15, then already the hash wouldn't fit into a 64-bit integer (e.g. unsigned long long) any more, because there are so many of them.
    And of course, we don't want to compare arbitrary long integers, because this will also have the complexity $O(n)$.

    So usually we want the hash function to map strings onto numbers of a fixed range $[0, m)$, then comparing strings is just a comparison of two integers with a fixed length.
    And of course, we want $\text{hash}(s) \neq \text{hash}(t)$ to be very likely if $s \neq t$.

    That's the important part that you have to keep in mind.
    Using hashing will not be 100% deterministically correct, because two complete different strings might have the same hash (the hashes collide).
    However, in a wide majority of tasks, this can be safely ignored as the probability of the hashes of two different strings colliding is still very small.
    And we will discuss some techniques in this article how to keep the probability of collisions very low.

    ## Calculation of the hash of a string

    The good and widely used way to define the hash of a string $s$ of length $n$ is

    $$\begin{align}
    \text{hash}(s) &= s[0] + s[1] \cdot p + s[2] \cdot p^2 + ... + s[n-1] \cdot p^{n-1} \mod m \\
    &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \cdot p^i \mod m,
    \end{align}$$

    where $p$ and $m$ are some chosen, positive numbers.
    It is called a **polynomial rolling hash function**.

    It is reasonable to make $p$ a prime number roughly equal to the number of characters in the input alphabet.
    For example, if the input is composed of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, $p = 31$ is a good choice.
    If the input may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, then $p = 53$ is a possible choice.
    The code in this article will use $p = 31$.

    Obviously $m$ should be a large number since the probability of two random strings colliding is about $\approx \frac{1}{m}$.
    Sometimes $m = 2^{64}$ is chosen, since then the integer overflows of 64-bit integers work exactly like the modulo operation.
    However, there exists a method, which generates colliding strings (which work independently from the choice of $p$).
    So in practice, $m = 2^{64}$ is not recommended.
    A good choice for $m$ is some large prime number.
    The code in this article will just use $m = 10^9+9$.
    This is a large number, but still small enough so that we can perform multiplication of two values using 64-bit integers.

    Here is an example of calculating the hash of a string $s$, which contains only lowercase letters.
    We convert each character of $s$ to an integer.
    Here we use the conversion $a \rightarrow 1$, $b \rightarrow 2$, $\dots$, $z \rightarrow 26$.
    Converting $a \rightarrow 0$ is not a good idea, because then the hashes of the strings $a$, $aa$, $aaa$, $\dots$ all evaluate to $0$.

    ```{.cpp file=hashing_function}
    long long compute_hash(string const& s) {
        const int p = 31;
        const int m = 1e9 + 9;
        long long hash_value = 0;
        long long p_pow = 1;
        for (char c : s) {
            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;
            p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;
        }
        return hash_value;
    }
    ```

    Precomputing the powers of $p$ might give a performance boost.

    ## Example tasks

    ### Search for duplicate strings in an array of strings

    Problem: Given a list of $n$ strings $s_i$, each no longer than $m$ characters, find all the duplicate strings and divide them into groups.

    From the obvious algorithm involving sorting the strings, we would get a time complexity of $O(n m \log n)$ where the sorting requires $O(n \log n)$ comparisons and each comparison take $O(m)$ time.
    However, by using hashes, we reduce the comparison time to $O(1)$, giving us an algorithm that runs in $O(n m + n \log n)$ time.

    We calculate the hash for each string, sort the hashes together with the indices, and then group the indices by identical hashes.

    ```{.cpp file=hashing_group_identical_strings}
    vector<vector<int>> group_identical_strings(vector<string> const& s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<pair<long long, int>> hashes(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            hashes[i] = {compute_hash(s[i]), i};

        sort(hashes.begin(), hashes.end());

        vector<vector<int>> groups;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i == 0 || hashes[i].first != hashes[i-1].first)
                groups.emplace_back();
            groups.back().push_back(hashes[i].second);
        }
        return groups;
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/18 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes two strings as input. The function should remove all characters from the first string that are present in the second string and return the modified first string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate over each character in the first string and check if it is present in the second string. If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, we add it to a new result string. Finally, we return this result string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   1. Define a function `remove_dirty_chars` that takes two strings `s1` and `s2`.
   2. Create an empty string `result` to store the characters that are not in `s2`.
   3. For each character `char` in `s1`:
      a. If `char` is not in `s2`, append `char` to `result`.
   4. Return the `result` string.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def remove_dirty_chars(s1: str, s2: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty string to store the result
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate over each character in the first string
    for char in s1:
        # If the character is not in the second string, add it to the result
        if char not in s2:
            result += char
    
    # Return the result string
    return result
```

This solution iterates over each character in the first string and checks if it is present in the second string. If not, it appends the character to the result string. This approach ensures that all characters from the first string that are not in the second string are retained in the result.
