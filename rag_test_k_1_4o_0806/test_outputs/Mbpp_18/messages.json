The function should remove all characters from the first string that are present in the second string. The result should be a new string containing only the characters from the first string that are not found in the second string.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Characters to Remove**: First, identify all the characters in the second string. These are the characters that need to be removed from the first string.\n2. **Filter the First String**: Iterate through each character in the first string and check if it is present in the second string.\n3. **Build the Result String**: If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, include it in the result string. Otherwise, skip it.\n4. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters in the first string, return the result string.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction remove_dirty_chars(first_string, second_string):\n    create an empty result string\n    for each character in first_string:\n        if character is not in second_string:\n            append character to result string\n    return result string\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(first_string: str, second_string: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = ''\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the first string\n    for char in first_string:\n        # Check if the character is not in the second string\n        if char not in second_string:\n            # If not, add it to the result string\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the final result string\n    return result\n```"

Calculation of the hash of a string\n\n    The good and widely used way to define the hash of a string $s$ of length $n$ is\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    \\text{hash}(s) &= s[0] + s[1] \\cdot p + s[2] \\cdot p^2 + ... + s[n-1] \\cdot p^{n-1} \\mod m \\\\\n    &= \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \\cdot p^i \\mod m,\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    where $p$ and $m$ are some chosen, positive numbers.\n    It is called a **polynomial rolling hash function**.\n\n    It is reasonable to make $p$ a prime number roughly equal to the number of characters in the input alphabet.\n    For example, if the input is composed of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, $p = 31$ is a good choice.\n    If the input may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, then $p = 53$ is a possible choice.\n    The code in this article will use $p = 31$.\n\n    Obviously $m$ should be a large number since the probability of two random strings colliding is about $\\approx \\frac{1}{m}$.\n    Sometimes $m = 2^{64}$ is chosen, since then the integer overflows of 64-bit integers work exactly like the modulo operation.\n    However, there exists a method, which generates colliding strings (which work independently from the choice of $p$).\n    So in practice, $m = 2^{64}$ is not recommended.\n    A good choice for $m$ is some large prime number.\n    The code in this article will just use $m = 10^9+9$.\n    This is a large number, but still small enough so that we can perform multiplication of two values using 64-bit integers.\n\n    Here is an example of calculating the hash of a string $s$, which contains only lowercase letters.\n    We convert each character of $s$ to an integer.\n    Here we use the conversion $a \\rightarrow 1$, $b \\rightarrow 2$, $\\dots$, $z \\rightarrow 26$.\n    Converting $a \\rightarrow 0$ is not a good idea, because then the hashes of the strings $a$, $aa$, $aaa$, $\\dots$ all evaluate to $0$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=hashing_function}\n    long long compute_hash(string const& s) {\n        const int p = 31;\n        const int m = 1e9 + 9;\n        long long hash_value = 0;\n        long long p_pow = 1;\n        for (char c : s) {\n            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;\n            p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;\n        }\n        return hash_value;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Precomputing the powers of $p$ might give a performance boost.\n\n    ## Example tasks\n\n    ### Search for duplicate strings in an array of strings\n\n    Problem: Given a list of $n$ strings $s_i$, each no longer than $m$ characters, find all the duplicate strings and divide them into groups.\n\n    From the obvious algorithm involving sorting the strings, we would get a time complexity of $O(n m \\log n)$ where the sorting requires $O(n \\log n)$ comparisons and each comparison take $O(m)$ time.\n    However, by using hashes, we reduce the comparison time to $O(1)$, giving us an algorithm that runs in $O(n m + n \\log n)$ time.\n\n    We calculate the hash for each string, sort the hashes together with the indices, and then group the indices by identical hashes.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=hashing_group_identical_strings}\n    vector<vector<int>> group_identical_strings(vector<string> const& s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<pair<long long, int>> hashes(n);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n            hashes[i] = {compute_hash(s[i]), i};\n\n        sort(hashes.begin(), hashes.end());\n\n        vector<vector<int>> groups;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            if (i == 0 || hashes[i].first != hashes[i-1].first)\n                groups.emplace_back();\n            groups.back().push_back(hashes[i].second);\n        }\n        return groups;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, we add it to a new result string. Finally, we return this result string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   1. Define a function `remove_dirty_chars` that takes two strings `s1` and `s2`.\n   2. Create an empty string `result` to store the characters that are not in `s2`.\n   3. For each character `char` in `s1`:\n      a. If `char` is not in `s2`, append `char` to `result`.\n   4. Return the `result` string.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(s1: str, s2: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the first string\n    for char in s1:\n        # If the character is not in the second string, add it to the result\n        if char not in s2:\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the result string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each character in the first string and checks if it is present in the second string. If not, it appends the character to the result string. This approach ensures that all characters from the first string that are not in the second string are retained in the result."
