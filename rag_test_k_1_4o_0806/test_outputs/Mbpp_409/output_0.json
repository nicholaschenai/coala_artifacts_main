    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should calculate the product of the two integers in each tuple and return the smallest product found among all the tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize a variable to store the minimum product found so far. Start with a very large number.\n   - Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, calculate the product of its two elements.\n   - If this product is smaller than the current minimum product, update the minimum product.\n   - After checking all tuples, return the minimum product found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function min_product_tuple(list_of_tuples):\n       set min_product to a very large number\n       for each tuple in list_of_tuples:\n           calculate product of the two numbers in the tuple\n           if product is less than min_product:\n               update min_product to be this product\n       return min_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef min_product_tuple(list_of_tuples):\n    # Initialize min_product with a very large number\n    min_product = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for a, b in list_of_tuples:\n        # Calculate the product of the two numbers in the tuple\n        product = a * b\n        \n        # If the calculated product is less than the current min_product, update min_product\n        if product < min_product:\n            min_product = product\n    \n    # Return the smallest product found\n    return min_product\n```",
