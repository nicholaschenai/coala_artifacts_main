    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where the order of the words is reversed. Words in the string are separated by spaces.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, split the input string into a list of words using spaces as the delimiter.\n   - Reverse the order of the words in this list.\n   - Join the reversed list of words back into a single string with spaces in between each word.\n   - Return the resulting string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function reverse_words(input_string):\n       split the input_string into a list of words using space as the delimiter\n       reverse the list of words\n       join the reversed list into a single string with spaces in between\n       return the resulting string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s: str) -> str:\n    # Split the input string into a list of words\n    words = s.split()\n    # Reverse the list of words\n    reversed_words = words[::-1]\n    # Join the reversed list into a single string with spaces in between\n    reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)\n    # Return the resulting string\n    return reversed_string\n```",
