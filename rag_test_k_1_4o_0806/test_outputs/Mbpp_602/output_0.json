    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the first character that appears more than once in the string. If a character is repeated, we should return the first one that repeats.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string while keeping track of the characters we have already seen. We can use a set to store these characters. As we iterate through the string, we check if the current character is already in the set. If it is, that means it is the first repeated character, and we return it. If it is not in the set, we add it to the set and continue to the next character.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty set called seen_characters\n   For each character in the string:\n       If the character is in seen_characters:\n           Return the character (it is the first repeated character)\n       Else:\n           Add the character to seen_characters\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty set to keep track of seen characters\n    seen_characters = set()\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # If the character is already in the set, it is the first repeated character\n        if char in seen_characters:\n            return char\n        # Otherwise, add the character to the set\n        seen_characters.add(char)\n```\n\nThis function will correctly find and return the first repeated character in the given string.",
