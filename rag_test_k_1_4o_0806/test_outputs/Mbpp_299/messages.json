The function should calculate the total score for each unique name and return the name with the highest total score along with that score.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize a Dictionary**: Use a dictionary to keep track of the total scores for each name. The keys will be the names, and the values will be the accumulated scores.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the List**: For each tuple in the list, extract the name and score. Add the score to the corresponding entry in the dictionary. If the name is not already in the dictionary, initialize it with the current score.\n\n3. **Find the Maximum**: After processing all tuples, iterate through the dictionary to find the name with the highest total score.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Return a tuple containing the name with the highest score and the score itself.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_aggregate(tuples_list):\n    initialize an empty dictionary called scores_dict\n\n    for each tuple (name, score) in tuples_list:\n        if name is in scores_dict:\n            add score to scores_dict[name]\n        else:\n            set scores_dict[name] = score\n\n    initialize max_name as None\n    initialize max_score as 0\n\n    for each name, total_score in scores_dict:\n        if total_score > max_score:\n            set max_score to total_score\n            set max_name to name\n\n    return (max_name, max_score)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_aggregate(tuples_list):\n    # Initialize a dictionary to store the total scores for each name\n    scores_dict = {}\n\n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for name, score in tuples_list:\n        # If the name is already in the dictionary, add the score to the existing total\n        if name in scores_dict:\n            scores_dict[name] += score\n        # If the name is not in the dictionary, initialize it with the current score\n        else:\n            scores_dict[name] = score\n\n    # Initialize variables to track the name with the maximum score\n    max_name = None\n    max_score = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the dictionary to find the name with the highest total score\n    for name, total_score in scores_dict.items():\n        if total_score > max_score:\n            max_score = total_score\n            max_name = name\n\n    # Return the name with the highest score and the score itself\n    return (max_name, max_score)\n```"

For example, in a two-dimensional case, it turns into a search for such a submatrix $[l_1 \\ldots r_1, l_2 \\ldots r_2]$ of a given matrix, which has the maximum sum of numbers in it.\n\n    Using the solution for the one-dimensional case, it is easy to obtain a solution in $O(n^3)$ for the two-dimensions case:\n    we iterate over all possible values of $l_1$ and $r_1$, and calculate the sums from $l_1$ to $r_1$ in each row of the matrix. Now we have the one-dimensional problem of finding the indices $l_2$ and $r_2$ in this array, which can already be solved in linear time.\n\n    **Faster** algorithms for solving this problem are known, but they are not much faster than $O(n^3)$, and are very complex (so complex that many of them are inferior to the trivial algorithm for all reasonable constraints by the hidden constant). Currently, the best known algorithm works in $O\\left(n^3 \\frac{ \\log^3 \\log n }{ \\log^2 n} \\right)$ time (T. Chan 2007 \"More algorithms for all-pairs shortest paths in weighted graphs\")\n\n    This algorithm by Chan, as well as many other results in this area, actually describe **fast matrix multiplication** (where matrix multiplication means modified multiplication: minimum is used instead of addition, and addition is used instead of multiplication). The problem of finding the submatrix with the largest sum can be reduced to the problem of finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, and this problem, in turn, can be reduced to such a multiplication of matrices.\n\n    ### Search for a subarray with a maximum/minimum average\n\n    This problem lies in finding such a segment $a[l, r]$, such that the average value is maximal:\n\n    $$ \\max_{l \\le r} \\frac{ 1 }{ r-l+1 } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    Of course, if no other conditions are imposed on the required segment $[l, r]$, then the solution will always be a segment of length $1$ at the maximum element of the array. \n    The problem only makes sense, if there are additional restrictions (for example, the length of the desired segment is bounded below).\n\n    In this case, we apply the **standard technique** when working with the problems of the average value: we will select the desired maximum average value by **binary search**.\n\n    To do this, we need to learn how to solve the following subproblem: given the number $x$, and we need to check whether there is a subarray of array $a[]$ (of course, satisfying all additional constraints of the problem), where the average value is greater than $x$.\n\n    To solve this subproblem, subtract $x$ from each element of array $a[]$. Then our subproblem actually turns into this one: whether or not there are positive sum subarrays in this array. And we already know how to solve this problem.\n\n    Thus, we obtained the solution for the asymptotic $O(T(n) \\log W)$, where $W$ is the required accuracy, $T(n)$ is the time of solving the subtask for an array of length $n$ (which may vary depending on the specific additional restrictions imposed).\n\n    ### Solving the online problem\n\n    The condition of the problem is as follows: given an array of $n$ numbers, and a number $L$. There are queries of the form $(l,r)$, and in response to each query, it is required to find a subarray of the segment $[l, r]$ of length not less than $L$ with the maximum possible arithmetic mean.\n\n    The algorithm for solving this problem is quite complex. KADR (Yaroslav Tverdokhleb) described his algorithm on the [Russian forum](http://e-maxx.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?id=410).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
