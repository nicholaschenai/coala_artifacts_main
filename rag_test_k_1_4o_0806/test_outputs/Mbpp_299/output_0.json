    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains a name (a string) and a number (an integer). The function should calculate the total sum of numbers for each unique name and return the name with the highest total sum along with that sum.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Create a dictionary to store the aggregate sum for each name.\n   - Iterate over the list of tuples.\n   - For each tuple, add the number to the corresponding name's total in the dictionary.\n   - After processing all tuples, find the name with the maximum total sum in the dictionary.\n   - Return the name and the maximum sum as a tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty dictionary to store the aggregate sums.\n   For each tuple (name, number) in the list:\n       If the name is not in the dictionary, add it with the number as its value.\n       If the name is already in the dictionary, add the number to its current value.\n   Find the name with the maximum value in the dictionary.\n   Return the name and the maximum value as a tuple.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_aggregate(data: list) -> tuple:\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the aggregate sums for each name\n    aggregates = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for name, number in data:\n        # If the name is not in the dictionary, add it with the current number\n        if name not in aggregates:\n            aggregates[name] = number\n        else:\n            # If the name is already in the dictionary, add the number to its current value\n            aggregates[name] += number\n    \n    # Find the name with the maximum aggregate sum\n    max_name = max(aggregates, key=aggregates.get)\n    max_sum = aggregates[max_name]\n    \n    # Return the name and the maximum sum as a tuple\n    return (max_name, max_sum)\n```",
