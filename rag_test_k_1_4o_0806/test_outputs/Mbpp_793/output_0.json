    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that finds the last position (index) of a given element in a sorted list. The function should return the index of the last occurrence of the element if it exists, or indicate that the element is not present.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Since the list is sorted, we can use a binary search approach to efficiently find the last occurrence of the element. The idea is to modify the standard binary search to continue searching even after finding the element, to ensure we find the last occurrence. We will adjust our search boundaries based on whether the middle element is less than, greater than, or equal to the target element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function last(arr, target):\n       initialize low to 0\n       initialize high to length of arr - 1\n       initialize result to -1 (to indicate not found)\n\n       while low <= high:\n           calculate mid as (low + high) // 2\n           if arr[mid] is equal to target:\n               set result to mid (potential last occurrence)\n               move low to mid + 1 (search right half)\n           else if arr[mid] is less than target:\n               move low to mid + 1 (search right half)\n           else:\n               move high to mid - 1 (search left half)\n\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\ndef last(arr, target):\n    # Initialize the low and high pointers for binary search\n    low = 0\n    high = len(arr) - 1\n    # Initialize result to -1 to indicate the target is not found\n    result = -1\n\n    # Perform binary search\n    while low <= high:\n        # Calculate the middle index\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        # If the middle element is the target, update result and search right\n        if arr[mid] == target:\n            result = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        # If the middle element is less than the target, search the right half\n        elif arr[mid] < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        # If the middle element is greater than the target, search the left half\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    # Return the last occurrence index or -1 if not found\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the last occurrence of the target element in a sorted list. The `result` variable keeps track of the last found index of the target, and the search continues to the right half to ensure the last occurrence is found.",
