    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts how many characters in a given string are in the same position as they are in the English alphabet. For example, 'a' should be in the 1st position, 'b' in the 2nd position, and so on. The comparison should be case insensitive.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Convert the input string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.\n   - Iterate over each character in the string along with its index.\n   - For each character, check if its position in the string (1-based index) matches its position in the alphabet.\n   - Count how many such matches occur.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function count_char_position(s):\n       convert s to lowercase\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each character c in s with index i:\n           if the position of c in the alphabet is i + 1:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_char_position(s: str) -> int:\n    # Convert the string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity\n    s = s.lower()\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for characters that match their alphabet position\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string with its index\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        # Calculate the alphabet position of the character (1-based index)\n        alphabet_position = ord(c) - ord('a') + 1\n        \n        # Check if the character's position in the string matches its alphabet position\n        if alphabet_position == i + 1:\n            # Increment the count if it matches\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of matching characters\n    return count\n```\n\nThis code will correctly count the number of characters in the string that are in the same position as they are in the English alphabet, considering case insensitivity.",
