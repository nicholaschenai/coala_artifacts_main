The trapezium is defined by three lengths: the two parallel sides (bases) and the height. The median of a trapezium is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the median length of a trapezium, we need to:\n   - Take the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases) as inputs.\n   - Calculate the average of these two lengths.\n   - Return this average as the median length of the trapezium.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function median_trapezium(base1, base2, height):\n       calculate the average of base1 and base2\n       return the average\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef median_trapezium(base1: int, base2: int, height: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the average of the two bases\n    median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2\n    # Return the median length as an integer\n    return int(median_length)\n```\n\nThis function takes three integer inputs: `base1`, `base2`, and `height`. It calculates the median length of the trapezium by averaging the two base lengths and returns the result as an integer. The height is not used in the calculation of the median length."

For example, in a two-dimensional case, it turns into a search for such a submatrix $[l_1 \\ldots r_1, l_2 \\ldots r_2]$ of a given matrix, which has the maximum sum of numbers in it.\n\n    Using the solution for the one-dimensional case, it is easy to obtain a solution in $O(n^3)$ for the two-dimensions case:\n    we iterate over all possible values of $l_1$ and $r_1$, and calculate the sums from $l_1$ to $r_1$ in each row of the matrix. Now we have the one-dimensional problem of finding the indices $l_2$ and $r_2$ in this array, which can already be solved in linear time.\n\n    **Faster** algorithms for solving this problem are known, but they are not much faster than $O(n^3)$, and are very complex (so complex that many of them are inferior to the trivial algorithm for all reasonable constraints by the hidden constant). Currently, the best known algorithm works in $O\\left(n^3 \\frac{ \\log^3 \\log n }{ \\log^2 n} \\right)$ time (T. Chan 2007 \"More algorithms for all-pairs shortest paths in weighted graphs\")\n\n    This algorithm by Chan, as well as many other results in this area, actually describe **fast matrix multiplication** (where matrix multiplication means modified multiplication: minimum is used instead of addition, and addition is used instead of multiplication). The problem of finding the submatrix with the largest sum can be reduced to the problem of finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, and this problem, in turn, can be reduced to such a multiplication of matrices.\n\n    ### Search for a subarray with a maximum/minimum average\n\n    This problem lies in finding such a segment $a[l, r]$, such that the average value is maximal:\n\n    $$ \\max_{l \\le r} \\frac{ 1 }{ r-l+1 } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    Of course, if no other conditions are imposed on the required segment $[l, r]$, then the solution will always be a segment of length $1$ at the maximum element of the array. \n    The problem only makes sense, if there are additional restrictions (for example, the length of the desired segment is bounded below).\n\n    In this case, we apply the **standard technique** when working with the problems of the average value: we will select the desired maximum average value by **binary search**.\n\n    To do this, we need to learn how to solve the following subproblem: given the number $x$, and we need to check whether there is a subarray of array $a[]$ (of course, satisfying all additional constraints of the problem), where the average value is greater than $x$.\n\n    To solve this subproblem, subtract $x$ from each element of array $a[]$. Then our subproblem actually turns into this one: whether or not there are positive sum subarrays in this array. And we already know how to solve this problem.\n\n    Thus, we obtained the solution for the asymptotic $O(T(n) \\log W)$, where $W$ is the required accuracy, $T(n)$ is the time of solving the subtask for an array of length $n$ (which may vary depending on the specific additional restrictions imposed).\n\n    ### Solving the online problem\n\n    The condition of the problem is as follows: given an array of $n$ numbers, and a number $L$. There are queries of the form $(l,r)$, and in response to each query, it is required to find a subarray of the segment $[l, r]$ of length not less than $L$ with the maximum possible arithmetic mean.\n\n    The algorithm for solving this problem is quite complex. KADR (Yaroslav Tverdokhleb) described his algorithm on the [Russian forum](http://e-maxx.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?id=410).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The median of a trapezium is the average of the lengths of its two parallel sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the median length of a trapezium, we need to identify the two parallel sides. In a trapezium, the two parallel sides are typically referred to as the \"bases.\" The median is calculated as the average of these two base lengths. Given three side lengths, we need to determine which two are the bases and then compute their average.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function median_trapezium(a, b, c):\n       - Assume a and b are the parallel sides (bases)\n       - Calculate the median as (a + b) / 2\n       - Return the median\n   ```\n\n   Note: The problem statement does not specify which sides are the bases, so we assume the first two arguments are the bases.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef median_trapezium(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Assume a and b are the parallel sides (bases) of the trapezium\n    # Calculate the median length of the trapezium\n    median = (a + b) / 2\n    # Return the median length as an integer\n    return int(median)\n```\n\nIn this solution, we assume that the first two arguments `a` and `b` are the parallel sides of the trapezium. We calculate the median by averaging these two values and return the result as an integer."
