    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the median length of a trapezium given the lengths of its three sides. The median of a trapezium is the average of the lengths of its two parallel sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the median length of a trapezium, we need to identify the two parallel sides. In a trapezium, the two parallel sides are typically referred to as the \"bases.\" The median is calculated as the average of these two base lengths. Given three side lengths, we need to determine which two are the bases and then compute their average.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function median_trapezium(a, b, c):\n       - Assume a and b are the parallel sides (bases)\n       - Calculate the median as (a + b) / 2\n       - Return the median\n   ```\n\n   Note: The problem statement does not specify which sides are the bases, so we assume the first two arguments are the bases.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef median_trapezium(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Assume a and b are the parallel sides (bases) of the trapezium\n    # Calculate the median length of the trapezium\n    median = (a + b) / 2\n    # Return the median length as an integer\n    return int(median)\n```\n\nIn this solution, we assume that the first two arguments `a` and `b` are the parallel sides of the trapezium. We calculate the median by averaging these two values and return the result as an integer.",
