INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/271 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and calculates the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, each raised to the fifth power.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
- Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. Even natural numbers start from 2 and increase by 2 (i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...).
- For each of these even numbers, raise it to the power of 5.
- Sum all these fifth powers to get the final result.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function even_Power_Sum(n):
    initialize sum to 0
    for i from 1 to n:
        calculate the ith even number as 2 * i
        raise this even number to the power of 5
        add the result to sum
    return sum
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def even_Power_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Loop through the first n even numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the ith even number
        even_number = 2 * i
        # Raise the even number to the power of 5
        power_five = even_number ** 5
        # Add the result to the total sum
        total_sum += power_five
    
    # Return the total sum
    return total_sum
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, each raised to the fifth power, as required by the problem statement.
