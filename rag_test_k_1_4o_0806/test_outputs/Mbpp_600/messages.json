If the number is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - A number is considered even if it is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. In other words, if the remainder when dividing the number by 2 is zero, the number is even. We can use the modulus operator `%` to determine this. If `number % 2 == 0`, then the number is even.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `is_Even` that takes one parameter `number`.\n   - Use the modulus operator to check if `number % 2` equals zero.\n   - If it does, return `True`.\n   - Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_Even(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder\n    if number % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if a given integer is even by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is zero. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating the number is even; otherwise, it returns `False`."
