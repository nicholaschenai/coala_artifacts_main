INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/600 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that checks if a given integer is even. If the number is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - A number is considered even if it is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. In other words, if the remainder when dividing the number by 2 is zero, the number is even. We can use the modulus operator `%` to determine this. If `number % 2 == 0`, then the number is even.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `is_Even` that takes one parameter `number`.
   - Use the modulus operator to check if `number % 2` equals zero.
   - If it does, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_Even(number: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function will correctly determine if a given integer is even by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is zero. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating the number is even; otherwise, it returns `False`.
