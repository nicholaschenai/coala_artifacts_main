    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. The function should return a list of tuples where every element in each tuple is divisible by `k`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, check if all elements are divisible by `k`.\n   - If a tuple meets the condition (all elements are divisible by `k`), add it to the result list.\n   - Return the list of tuples that meet the condition.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_tuples(tuples, k):\n       result = []\n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           if all elements in tuple are divisible by k:\n               add tuple to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_tuples(tuples, k):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store tuples that meet the condition\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list\n    for t in tuples:\n        # Check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by k\n        if all(element % k == 0 for element in t):\n            # If the condition is met, add the tuple to the result list\n            result.append(t)\n    \n    # Return the list of tuples that have all elements divisible by k\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `find_tuples` which takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. It iterates over each tuple, checks if all elements are divisible by `k`, and collects those tuples in a result list, which is returned at the end.",
