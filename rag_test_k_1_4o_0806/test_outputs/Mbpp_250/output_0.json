    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a tuple and an element as inputs and returns the number of times the element appears in the tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each item in the tuple and check if it matches the given element. We will maintain a counter that increments each time we find a match. Finally, we return the counter value, which represents the number of occurrences of the element in the tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function count_X with parameters (tuple_data, element)\n       Initialize a counter to 0\n       For each item in tuple_data\n           If item equals element\n               Increment the counter by 1\n       Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_X(tuple_data: tuple, element: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate over each item in the tuple\n    for item in tuple_data:\n        # Check if the current item matches the element\n        if item == element:\n            # Increment the counter if there's a match\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n```",
