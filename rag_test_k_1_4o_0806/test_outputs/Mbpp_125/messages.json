        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s in any substring of a given binary string. The goal is to identify the substring where this difference is the largest.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's. We need to find a substring where the count of '0's minus the count of '1's is maximized.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n   - We can treat each '0' as +1 and each '1' as -1. This way, the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, which is a classic problem solvable by Kadane's algorithm.\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the current sum and another to keep track of the maximum sum found so far.\n   - Traverse the string, updating the current sum by adding +1 for '0' and -1 for '1'.\n   - If the current sum becomes negative, reset it to zero (since a negative sum would not contribute positively to any future subarray).\n   - Update the maximum sum whenever the current sum exceeds it.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If the string is empty, the maximum difference is 0.\n   - If the string contains only '1's, the maximum difference is 0.\n   - If the string contains only '0's, the maximum difference is the length of the string.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_length(s):\n    max_diff = 0\n    current_diff = 0\n    \n    for each character in s:\n        if character is '0':\n            current_diff += 1\n        else if character is '1':\n            current_diff -= 1\n        \n        if current_diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = current_diff\n        \n        if current_diff < 0:\n            current_diff = 0\n    \n    return max_diff\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_length(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum difference and current difference\n    max_diff = 0\n    current_diff = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # Increment current_diff for '0', decrement for '1'\n        if char == '0':\n            current_diff += 1\n        else:  # char == '1'\n            current_diff -= 1\n        \n        # Update max_diff if current_diff is greater\n        if current_diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = current_diff\n        \n        # Reset current_diff if it becomes negative\n        if current_diff < 0:\n            current_diff = 0\n    \n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_diff\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the maximum difference using a single pass through the string, making it O(n) in time complexity, where n is the length of the string."

It is required to find a subarray $a[l \\ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:\n\n    $$ \\max_{ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.\n    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\n    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.\n\n    ## Algorithm 1\n\n    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm is very simple.\n\n    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.\n\n    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \\ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.\n\n    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.\n\n    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.\n\n    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ \u2014 we will only need the current element from it.\n\n    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.\n\n    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        int cur = sum - min_sum;\n        if (cur > ans) {\n            ans = cur;\n            ans_l = min_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < min_sum) {\n            min_sum = sum;\n            min_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Algorithm 2\n\n    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.\n\n    **Proof:**\n\n    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum \u2014 so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.\n\n    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.\n\n    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a \"critical\" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \\ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.\n\n    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum);\n        sum = max(sum, 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        if (sum > ans) {\n            ans = sum;\n            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < 0) {\n            sum = 0;\n            minus_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
