    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s in any substring of a given binary string. This means we want to find a substring where the count of 0s minus the count of 1s is the largest possible.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can transform the binary string into an array of numbers where each '0' is represented as +1 and each '1' is represented as -1. This transformation allows us to convert the problem into finding the maximum sum of a subarray, which is a well-known problem that can be efficiently solved using Kadane's algorithm. The maximum sum of this transformed array will give us the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_length(binary_string):\n       Initialize max_diff to 0\n       Initialize current_sum to 0\n\n       for each character in binary_string:\n           if character is '0':\n               Add 1 to current_sum\n           else if character is '1':\n               Subtract 1 from current_sum\n\n           if current_sum > max_diff:\n               Update max_diff to current_sum\n\n           if current_sum < 0:\n               Reset current_sum to 0\n\n       return max_diff\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_length(binary_string: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum difference found so far to 0\n    max_diff = 0\n    # Initialize the current sum to 0\n    current_sum = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the binary string\n    for char in binary_string:\n        # If the character is '0', treat it as +1\n        if char == '0':\n            current_sum += 1\n        # If the character is '1', treat it as -1\n        else:\n            current_sum -= 1\n\n        # Update the maximum difference if the current sum is greater\n        if current_sum > max_diff:\n            max_diff = current_sum\n\n        # If the current sum becomes negative, reset it to 0\n        if current_sum < 0:\n            current_sum = 0\n\n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_diff\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring by leveraging the concept of maximum subarray sum, which is solved using Kadane's algorithm.",
