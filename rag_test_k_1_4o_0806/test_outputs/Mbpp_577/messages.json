The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The task is to find the last digit of this product.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Factorials**: The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all integers from 1 to `n`. For example, `4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24`.\n\n2. **Last Digit**: The last digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. For example, the last digit of 24 is 4 because `24 % 10 = 4`.\n\n3. **Observations**:\n   - For numbers `n >= 5`, the factorial will always end in 0 because the factorial will include both 2 and 5 as factors, which multiply to give 10.\n   - For numbers `n < 5`, we can directly compute the factorial and then find the last digit.\n\n4. **Plan**:\n   - If `n` is less than 5, compute the factorial and return the last digit.\n   - If `n` is 5 or greater, return 0 because the factorial will end in 0.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n    if n < 5:\n        factorial = 1\n        for i from 1 to n:\n            factorial = factorial * i\n        return factorial % 10\n    else:\n        return 0\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is less than 5, calculate the factorial and return the last digit\n    if n < 5:\n        factorial = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            factorial *= i\n        return factorial % 10\n    else:\n        # If n is 5 or greater, the factorial will end in 0\n        return 0\n```"

\\bmod p$, without taking all the multiple factors of $p$ into account that appear in the factorial.\n    Imaging you write down the prime factorization of $n!$, remove all factors $p$, and compute the product modulo $p$.\n    We will denote this *modified* factorial with $n!_{\\%p}$.\n    For instance $7!_{\\%p} \\equiv 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{3} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\underbrace{2}_{6} \\cdot 7 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 3$.\n\n    Learning how to effectively calculate this modified factorial allows us to quickly calculate the value of the various combinatorial formulas (for example, [Binomial coefficients](../combinatorics/binomial-coefficients.md)).\n\n    ## Algorithm\n    Let's write this modified factorial explicitly.\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    n!_{\\%p} &=& 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p} \\cdot (p+1) \\cdot (p+2) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (2p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{2}_{2p} \\\\\\\n     & &\\quad \\cdot (2p+1) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p^2-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p^2} \\cdot (p^2 +1) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n \\pmod{p} \\\\\\\\\n    &=& 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{2}_{2p} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\\\\\\n    & &\\quad \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p^2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (n \\bmod p) \\pmod{p}\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    It can be clearly seen that factorial is divided into several blocks of same length except for the last one.\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    n!_{\\%p}&=& \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot 1}_{1\\text{st}} \\cdot \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot 2}_{2\\text{nd}} \\cdot \\ldots \\\\\\\\\n    & & \\cdot \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot 1}_{p\\text{th}} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\quad \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (n \\bmod p)}_{\\text{tail}} \\pmod{p}.\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    The main part of the blocks it is easy to count \u2014 it's just $(p-1)!\\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ p$.\n    We can compute that programmatically or just apply Wilson theorem which states that $(p-1)! \\bmod p = -1$ for any prime $p$.\n\n    We have exactly $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\rfloor$ such blocks, therefore we need to raise $-1$ to the power of $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\rfloor$.\n    This can be done in logarithmic time using [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md); however you can also notice that the result will switch between $-1$ and $1$, so we only need to look at the parity of the exponent and multiply by $-1$ if the parity is odd.\n    And instead of a multiplication, we can also just subtract the current result from $p$.\n\n    The value of the last partial block can be calculated separately in $O(p)$.\n\n\n    This leaves only the last element of each block.\n    If we hide the already handled elements, we can see the following pattern:\n\n    $$n!_{\\%p} = \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 1 } \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot (p-1)} \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 1 } \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 1} \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 2} \\cdots$$\n\n    This again is a *modified* factorial, only with a much smaller dimension.\n    It's $\\lfloor n / p \\rfloor !_{\\%p}$.\n\n    Thus, during the calculation of the *modified* factorial $n\\!_{\\%p}$ we did $O(p)$ operations and are left with the calculation of $\\lfloor n / p \\rfloor !_{\\%p}$.\n    We have a recursive formula.\n    The recursion depth is $O(\\log_p n)$, and therefore the complete asymptotic behavior of the algorithm is $O(p \\log_p n)$.\n\n    Notice, if you precompute the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ 2!,~ \\dots,~ (p-1)!$ modulo $p$, then the complexity will just be $O(\\log_p n)$.\n\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    We don't need recursion because this is a case of tail recursion and thus can be easily implemented using iteration.\n    In the following implementation we precompute the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ \\dots,~ (p-1)!$, and thus have the runtime $O(p + \\log_p n)$.\n    If you need to call the function multiple times, then you can do the precomputation outside of the function and do the computation of $n!_{\\%p}$ in $O(\\log_p n)$ time.\n\n    ```cpp\n    int factmod(int n, int p) {\n        vector<int> f(p);\n        f[0] = 1;\n        for (int i = 1; i < p; i++)\n            f[i] = f[i-1] * i % p;\n\n        int res = 1;\n        while (n > 1) {\n            if ((n/p) % 2)\n                res = p - res;\n            res = res * f[n%p] % p;\n            n /= p;\n        }\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Alternative, if you only have limit memory and can't afford storing all factorials, you can also just remember the factorials that you need, sort them, and then compute them in one sweep by computing the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ 2!,~ \\dots,~ (p-1)!$ in a loop without storing them explicitly.\n\n    ## Multiplicity of $p$\n\n    If we want to compute a Binomial coefficient modulo $p$, then we additionally need the multiplicity of the $p$ in $n$, i.e. the number of times $p$ occurs in the prime factorization of $n$, or number of times we erased $p$ during the computation of the *modified* factorial.\n\n    [Legendre's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula) gives us a way to compute this in $O(\\log_p n)$ time.\n    The formula gives the multiplicity $\\nu_p$ as:\n\n    $$\\nu_p(n!) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^i} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\n    Thus we get the implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int multiplicity_factorial(int n, int p) {\n        int count = 0;\n        do {\n            n /= p;\n            count += n;\n        } while (n);\n        return count;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can be proven very easily using the same ideas that we did in the previous sections.\n    Remove all elements that don't contain the factor $p$.\n    This leaves $\\lfloor n/p \\rfloor$ element remaining.\n    If we remove the factor $p$ from each of them, we get the product $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdots \\lfloor n/p \\rfloor = \\lfloor n/p \\rfloor !$, and again we have a recursion.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The last digit of a number can be found by taking the number modulo 10.
