    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the last digit of the factorial of a given number `n`. The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the last digit of a factorial, we need to compute the factorial of the number and then determine the last digit of that result. The last digit of a number can be found by taking the number modulo 10. However, for numbers greater than or equal to 5, the factorial will always end in 0 because it includes both 2 and 5 as factors, which multiply to 10. Therefore, for numbers less than 5, we can compute the factorial directly and take the last digit. For numbers 5 and above, the last digit is always 0.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function last_Digit_Factorial(n):\n       if n >= 5:\n           return 0\n       else:\n           factorial = 1\n           for i from 1 to n:\n               factorial = factorial * i\n           return factorial % 10\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is 5 or greater, the factorial will end in 0 because it includes both 2 and 5 as factors.\n    if n >= 5:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Calculate the factorial for numbers less than 5\n        factorial = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            factorial *= i\n        # Return the last digit of the factorial\n        return factorial % 10\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by recognizing that for `n >= 5`, the factorial will always end in 0, and for smaller numbers, it calculates the factorial and extracts the last digit.",
