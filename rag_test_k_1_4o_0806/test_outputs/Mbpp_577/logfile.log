## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the last digit of the factorial of a given number `n`. The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The task is to find the last digit of this product.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Factorials**: The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all integers from 1 to `n`. For example, `4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24`.

2. **Last Digit**: The last digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. For example, the last digit of 24 is 4 because `24 % 10 = 4`.

3. **Observations**:
   - For numbers `n >= 5`, the factorial will always end in 0 because the factorial will include both 2 and 5 as factors, which multiply to give 10.
   - For numbers `n < 5`, we can directly compute the factorial and then find the last digit.

4. **Plan**:
   - If `n` is less than 5, compute the factorial and return the last digit.
   - If `n` is 5 or greater, return 0 because the factorial will end in 0.

## Pseudocode

```
function last_Digit_Factorial(n):
    if n < 5:
        factorial = 1
        for i from 1 to n:
            factorial = factorial * i
        return factorial % 10
    else:
        return 0
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def last_Digit_Factorial(n: int) -> int:
    # If n is less than 5, calculate the factorial and return the last digit
    if n < 5:
        factorial = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            factorial *= i
        return factorial % 10
    else:
        # If n is 5 or greater, the factorial will end in 0
        return 0

    Title: Factorial modulo $p$
    Part: 1/1
    # Factorial modulo $p$

    In some cases it is necessary to consider complex formulas modulo some prime $p$, containing factorials in both numerator and denominator, like such that you encounter in the formula for Binomial coefficients.
    We consider the case when $p$ is relatively small.
    This problem makes only sense when the factorials appear in both numerator and denominator of fractions.
    Otherwise $p!$ and subsequent terms will reduce to zero.
    But in fractions the factors of $p$ can cancel, and the resulting expression will be non-zero modulo $p$.

    Thus, formally the task is: You want to calculate $n! \bmod p$, without taking all the multiple factors of $p$ into account that appear in the factorial.
    Imaging you write down the prime factorization of $n!$, remove all factors $p$, and compute the product modulo $p$.
    We will denote this *modified* factorial with $n!_{\%p}$.
    For instance $7!_{\%p} \equiv 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \underbrace{1}_{3} \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \underbrace{2}_{6} \cdot 7 \equiv 2 \bmod 3$.

    Learning how to effectively calculate this modified factorial allows us to quickly calculate the value of the various combinatorial formulas (for example, [Binomial coefficients](../combinatorics/binomial-coefficients.md)).

    ## Algorithm
    Let's write this modified factorial explicitly.

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    n!_{\%p} &=& 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-2) \cdot (p-1) \cdot \underbrace{1}_{p} \cdot (p+1) \cdot (p+2) \cdot \ldots \cdot (2p-1) \cdot \underbrace{2}_{2p} \\\
     & &\quad \cdot (2p+1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (p^2-1) \cdot \underbrace{1}_{p^2} \cdot (p^2 +1) \cdot \ldots \cdot n \pmod{p} \\\\
    &=& 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-2) \cdot (p-1) \cdot \underbrace{1}_{p} \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-1) \cdot \underbrace{2}_{2p} \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \\\
    & &\quad \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-1) \cdot \underbrace{1}_{p^2} \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \ldots \cdot (n \bmod p) \pmod{p}
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    It can be clearly seen that factorial is divided into several blocks of same length except for the last one.

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    n!_{\%p}&=& \underbrace{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-2) \cdot (p-1) \cdot 1}_{1\text{st}} \cdot \underbrace{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-2) \cdot (p-1) \cdot 2}_{2\text{nd}} \cdot \ldots \\\\
    & & \cdot \underbrace{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-2) \cdot (p-1) \cdot 1}_{p\text{th}} \cdot \ldots \cdot \quad \underbrace{1 \cdot 2 \cdot \cdot \ldots \cdot (n \bmod p)}_{\text{tail}} \pmod{p}.
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    The main part of the blocks it is easy to count â€” it's just $(p-1)!\ \mathrm{mod}\ p$.
    We can compute that programmatically or just apply Wilson theorem which states that $(p-1)! \bmod p = -1$ for any prime $p$.

    We have exactly $\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \rfloor$ such blocks, therefore we need to raise $-1$ to the power of $\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \rfloor$.
    This can be done in logarithmic time using [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md); however you can also notice that the result will switch between $-1$ and $1$, so we only need to look at the parity of the exponent and multiply by $-1$ if the parity is odd.
    And instead of a multiplication, we can also just subtract the current result from $p$.

    The value of the last partial block can be calculated separately in $O(p)$.


    This leaves only the last element of each block.
    If we hide the already handled elements, we can see the following pattern:

    $$n!_{\%p} = \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot 1 } \cdot \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot 2} \cdot \ldots \cdot \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot (p-1)} \cdot \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot 1 } \cdot \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot 1} \cdot \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot 2} \cdots$$

    This again is a *modified* factorial, only with a much smaller dimension.
    It's $\lfloor n / p \rfloor !_{\%p}$.

    Thus, during the calculation of the *modified* factorial $n\!_{\%p}$ we did $O(p)$ operations and are left with the calculation of $\lfloor n / p \rfloor !_{\%p}$.
    We have a recursive formula.
    The recursion depth is $O(\log_p n)$, and therefore the complete asymptotic behavior of the algorithm is $O(p \log_p n)$.

    Notice, if you precompute the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ 2!,~ \dots,~ (p-1)!$ modulo $p$, then the complexity will just be $O(\log_p n)$.


    ## Implementation

    We don't need recursion because this is a case of tail recursion and thus can be easily implemented using iteration.
    In the following implementation we precompute the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ \dots,~ (p-1)!$, and thus have the runtime $O(p + \log_p n)$.
    If you need to call the function multiple times, then you can do the precomputation outside of the function and do the computation of $n!_{\%p}$ in $O(\log_p n)$ time.

    ```cpp
    int factmod(int n, int p) {
        vector<int> f(p);
        f[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < p; i++)
            f[i] = f[i-1] * i % p;

        int res = 1;
        while (n > 1) {
            if ((n/p) % 2)
                res = p - res;
            res = res * f[n%p] % p;
            n /= p;
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```

    Alternative, if you only have limit memory and can't afford storing all factorials, you can also just remember the factorials that you need, sort them, and then compute them in one sweep by computing the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ 2!,~ \dots,~ (p-1)!$ in a loop without storing them explicitly.

    ## Multiplicity of $p$

    If we want to compute a Binomial coefficient modulo $p$, then we additionally need the multiplicity of the $p$ in $n$, i.e. the number of times $p$ occurs in the prime factorization of $n$, or number of times we erased $p$ during the computation of the *modified* factorial.

    [Legendre's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula) gives us a way to compute this in $O(\log_p n)$ time.
    The formula gives the multiplicity $\nu_p$ as:

    $$\nu_p(n!) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^i} \right\rfloor$$

    Thus we get the implementation:

    ```cpp
    int multiplicity_factorial(int n, int p) {
        int count = 0;
        do {
            n /= p;
            count += n;
        } while (n);
        return count;
    }
    ```

    This formula can be proven very easily using the same ideas that we did in the previous sections.
    Remove all elements that don't contain the factor $p$.
    This leaves $\lfloor n/p \rfloor$ element remaining.
    If we remove the factor $p$ from each of them, we get the product $1 \cdot 2 \cdots \lfloor n/p \rfloor = \lfloor n/p \rfloor !$, and again we have a recursion.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/577 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the last digit of the factorial of a given number `n`. The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the last digit of a factorial, we need to compute the factorial of the number and then determine the last digit of that result. The last digit of a number can be found by taking the number modulo 10. However, for numbers greater than or equal to 5, the factorial will always end in 0 because it includes both 2 and 5 as factors, which multiply to 10. Therefore, for numbers less than 5, we can compute the factorial directly and take the last digit. For numbers 5 and above, the last digit is always 0.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function last_Digit_Factorial(n):
       if n >= 5:
           return 0
       else:
           factorial = 1
           for i from 1 to n:
               factorial = factorial * i
           return factorial % 10
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def last_Digit_Factorial(n: int) -> int:
    # If n is 5 or greater, the factorial will end in 0 because it includes both 2 and 5 as factors.
    if n >= 5:

    else:
        # Calculate the factorial for numbers less than 5
        factorial = 1

            factorial *= i
        # Return the last digit of the factorial
        return factorial % 10
```

This solution efficiently handles the problem by recognizing that for `n >= 5`, the factorial will always end in 0, and for smaller numbers, it calculates the factorial and extracts the last digit.
