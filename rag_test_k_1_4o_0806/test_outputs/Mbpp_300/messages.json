        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the number of binary sequences of length `2n` such that the sum of the first `n` bits is equal to the sum of the last `n` bits. In simpler terms, we want to count how many ways we can split a binary sequence of length `2n` into two halves, each of length `n`, such that both halves have the same number of `1`s.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: For a binary sequence of length `2n`, we can split it into two halves of length `n`. We need to ensure that the number of `1`s in the first half is equal to the number of `1`s in the second half.\n\n2. **Combinatorial Approach**: \n   - For each possible number of `1`s in the first half (let's call it `k`), there must be exactly `k` `1`s in the second half.\n   - The number of ways to choose `k` `1`s from `n` bits is given by the binomial coefficient `C(n, k)`.\n   - Therefore, for each `k`, the number of valid sequences is `C(n, k) * C(n, k)` because we choose `k` `1`s for the first half and `k` `1`s for the second half independently.\n\n3. **Summing Up**: We sum up the products of binomial coefficients for all possible values of `k` from `0` to `n`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_binary_seq(n):\n    initialize total_count to 0\n    for k from 0 to n:\n        calculate C(n, k) as binomial coefficient\n        add C(n, k) * C(n, k) to total_count\n    return total_count\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n    if k > n:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    k = min(k, n - k)  # Take advantage of symmetry\n    c = 1\n    for i in range(k):\n        c = c * (n - i) // (i + 1)\n    return c\n\ndef count_binary_seq(n: int) -> float:\n    total_count = 0\n    for k in range(n + 1):\n        c_n_k = binomial_coefficient(n, k)\n        total_count += c_n_k * c_n_k\n    return float(total_count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`binomial_coefficient` Function**: This helper function calculates the binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` using an iterative approach to avoid large intermediate values.\n- **`count_binary_seq` Function**: This function iterates over all possible numbers of `1`s (`k`) in the first half of the sequence, calculates the number of valid sequences for each `k`, and sums them up to get the total count. The result is returned as a float to match the expected output type."

\\index{combinatorics}\n\n    \\key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting\n    combinations of objects.\n    Usually, the goal is to find a way to\n    count the combinations efficiently\n    without generating each combination separately.\n\n    As an example, consider the problem\n    of counting the number of ways to\n    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.\n    For example, there are 8 representations\n    for $4$:\n    \\begin{multicols}{2}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $1+1+1+1$\n    \\item $1+1+2$\n    \\item $1+2+1$\n    \\item $2+1+1$\n    \\item $2+2$\n    \\item $3+1$\n    \\item $1+3$\n    \\item $4$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{multicols}\n\n    A combinatorial problem can often be solved\n    using a recursive function.\n    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$\n    that gives the number of representations for $n$.\n    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.\n    The values of the function\n    can be recursively calculated as follows:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n                   1               & n = 0\\\\\n                   f(0)+f(1)+\\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case is $f(0)=1$,\n    because the empty sum represents the number 0.\n    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to\n    choose the first number of the sum.\n    If the first number is $k$,\n    there are $f(n-k)$ representations\n    for the remaining part of the sum.\n    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values\n    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.\n\n    The first values for the function are:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    f(0) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    f(3) & = & 4 \\\\\n    f(4) & = & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced\n    with a closed-form formula.\n    In this problem,\n    \\[\n    f(n)=2^{n-1},\n    \\]\n    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$\n    possible positions for +-signs in the sum\n    and we can choose any subset of them.\n\n    \\section{Binomial coefficients}\n\n    \\index{binomial coefficient}\n\n    The \\key{binomial coefficient} ${n \\choose k}$\n    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset\n    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, ${5 \\choose 3}=10$,\n    because the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:\n    \\[ \\{1,2,3\\}, \\{1,2,4\\}, \\{1,2,5\\}, \\{1,3,4\\}, \\{1,3,5\\}, \n    \\{1,4,5\\}, \\{2,3,4\\}, \\{2,3,5\\}, \\{2,4,5\\}, \\{3,4,5\\} \\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 1}\n\n    Binomial coefficients can be\n    recursively calculated as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k}\n    \\]\n\n    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.\n    If $x$ is included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k-1$\n    elements from $n-1$ elements,\n    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.\n\n    The base cases for the recursion are\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}  =  {n \\choose n} = 1,\n    \\]\n    because there is always exactly\n    one way to construct an empty subset\n    and a subset that contains all the elements.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 2}\n\n    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\n    \\]\n\n    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.\n    We go through all permutations and always\n    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation\n    in the subset.\n    Since the order of the elements in the subset\n    and outside the subset does not matter,\n    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$\n\n    \\subsubsection{Properties}\n\n    For binomial coefficients,\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n \\choose n-k},\n    \\]\n    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into\n    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements\n    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.\n\n    The sum of binomial coefficients is\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}+{n \\choose 1}+{n \\choose 2}+\\ldots+{n \\choose n}=2^n.\n    \\]\n\n    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''\n    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to\n    the $n$th power:\n\n    \\[ (a+b)^n =\n    {n \\choose 0} a^n b^0 + \n    {n \\choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +\n    \\ldots + \n    {n \\choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +\n    {n \\choose n} a^0 b^n. \\]\n\n
