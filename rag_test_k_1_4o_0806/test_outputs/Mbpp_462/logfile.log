INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of elements and returns all possible combinations (subsets) of those elements. The combinations should include the empty set and all possible non-empty subsets of the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find all possible combinations of a list, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to build combinations by either including or excluding each element of the list. We start with an empty combination and for each element, we create new combinations by adding the element to existing combinations. This way, we explore all possible subsets.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function `combinations_list` that takes a list `elements`.
   Initialize a list `result` with an empty list to store all combinations.
   
   Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes `current_combination` and `index`.
       If `index` is equal to the length of `elements`, add `current_combination` to `result`.
       Otherwise:
           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` and `index + 1` (exclude current element).
           Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` + [elements[index]] and `index + 1` (include current element).
   
   Call `generate_combinations` with an empty list and index 0.
   Return `result`.
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # This will store all the combinations
    result = []
    
    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If we've considered all elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
        else:
            # Exclude the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)
            # Include the current element and move to the next
            generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)
    
    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    return result
```

This solution uses a recursive approach to explore all possible subsets of the input list by considering each element in two ways: included in the current subset or excluded from it. The base case of the recursion is when all elements have been considered, at which point the current subset is added to the result list.

    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations
    Part: 1/1
    # Generating all $K$-combinations

    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.
    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.
    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.

    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label="Generate next lexicographical K-combination"}

    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.
    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how
    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our
    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once
    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent
    elements.

    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}
    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {
        int k = (int)a.size();
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {
                a[i]++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)
                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    ```

    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label="Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element"}

    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such
    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.

    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):
    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.

    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:
    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.
    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the
    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove
    a number, add a number).

    Let us prove this:

    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can 
    be obtained as follows:

    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \cup 1G(N-1)^\text{R}$$

    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the 
    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and
    concatenate these two sequences.

    Now we may produce our proof.

    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note
    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As
    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.
    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.

    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.

    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.

    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size
    $K$.

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}
    int gray_code (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }

    int count_bits (int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (; n; n >>= 1)
            res += n & 1;
        return res;
    }

    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            int cur = gray_code (i);
            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (cur & (1 << j))
                        cout << j + 1;
                }
                cout << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus
    works in $O\left(N \cdot \binom{N}{K}\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant
    than the previous solution.

    The implementation is derived from the formula:

    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\text{R}$$

    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the
    subsequence from appropriate elements.

    Its implementation is as follows:

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}
    vector<int> ans;

    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {
        if (k > n || k < 0)
            return;

        if (!n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {
                if (ans[i])
                    cout << i + 1;
            }
            cout << "\n";
            return;
        }

        ans[idx] = rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);
        ans[idx] = !rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);
    }

    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {
        ans.resize(n);
        gen(n, k, 0, false);
    }
    ```

            return
        
        # Exclude the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)
        
        # Include the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)

    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    # Return the result list containing all combinations
    return result
```

This code defines a function `combinations_list` that uses a recursive helper function `generate_combinations` to explore all possible subsets of the input list by including or excluding each element. The result is a list of all combinations, including the empty set.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate all possible combinations (subsets) of a given list.
   - The order of elements in each subset does not matter, but the order of subsets in the result list does matter according to the test case.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The function `combinations_list` uses a recursive approach to generate all subsets.
   - The subsets are generated by either including or excluding each element in the list.
   - The function correctly generates all subsets, but the order of subsets in the result list does not match the expected order in the test case.

3. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The issue is with the order of subsets in the result list. The expected order in the test case is based on the order of elements in the input list.
   - The current implementation generates subsets in a different order because it processes elements from the end of the list to the beginning.

4. **Correcting the Approach:**
   - To match the expected order, we need to ensure that subsets are generated by processing elements from the beginning of the list to the end.
   - This means that when we include an element in a subset, it should be added in the order it appears in the input list.

5. **Revising the Solution:**
   - We need to adjust the recursive function to ensure that subsets are generated in the correct order.

Let's revise the code to address this issue:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # Initialize the result list with an empty list to store all combinations
    result = []

    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If the index is equal to the length of elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
            return
        
        # Include the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)
        
        # Exclude the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)

    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    # Return the result list containing all combinations
    return result
```

In this revised solution, the order of recursive calls is adjusted to first include the current element and then exclude it. This ensures that subsets are generated in the order expected by the test case.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of elements and returns all possible combinations (subsets) of those elements. The combinations should include the empty set and all possible subsets of the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find all possible combinations of a list, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to generate subsets by either including or excluding each element in the list. We start with an empty subset and for each element, we create new subsets by adding the element to existing subsets. This process is repeated for all elements in the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function `combinations_list` that takes a list `elements` as input.
   Initialize a list `result` with an empty list to store all combinations.
   
   Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes `current_combination` and `index` as parameters.
       If `index` is equal to the length of `elements`, add `current_combination` to `result` and return.
       Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` unchanged and `index + 1` (exclude current element).
       Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` plus the current element and `index + 1` (include current element).
   
   Call `generate_combinations` with an empty list and index 0.
   Return `result`.
   ```

```python

    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations
    Part: 1/1
    # Generating all $K$-combinations

    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.
    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.
    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.

    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label="Generate next lexicographical K-combination"}

    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.
    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how
    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our
    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once
    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent
    elements.

    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}
    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {
        int k = (int)a.size();
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {
                a[i]++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)
                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    ```

    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label="Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element"}

    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such
    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.

    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):
    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.

    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:
    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.
    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the
    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove
    a number, add a number).

    Let us prove this:

    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can 
    be obtained as follows:

    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \cup 1G(N-1)^\text{R}$$

    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the 
    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and
    concatenate these two sequences.

    Now we may produce our proof.

    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note
    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As
    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.
    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.

    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.

    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.

    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size
    $K$.

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}
    int gray_code (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }

    int count_bits (int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (; n; n >>= 1)
            res += n & 1;
        return res;
    }

    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            int cur = gray_code (i);
            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (cur & (1 << j))
                        cout << j + 1;
                }
                cout << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus
    works in $O\left(N \cdot \binom{N}{K}\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant
    than the previous solution.

    The implementation is derived from the formula:

    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\text{R}$$

    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the
    subsequence from appropriate elements.

    Its implementation is as follows:

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}
    vector<int> ans;

    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {
        if (k > n || k < 0)
            return;

        if (!n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {
                if (ans[i])
                    cout << i + 1;
            }
            cout << "\n";
            return;
        }

        ans[idx] = rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);
        ans[idx] = !rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);
    }

    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {
        ans.resize(n);
        gen(n, k, 0, false);
    }
    ```

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of elements and returns all possible combinations (subsets) of those elements. The combinations should include the empty set and all possible subsets of the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find all possible combinations of a list, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to generate subsets by either including or excluding each element in the list. We start with an empty subset and for each element, we create new subsets by adding the element to existing subsets. This process is repeated for all elements in the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function `combinations_list` that takes a list `elements` as input.
   Initialize a list `result` with an empty list to store all combinations.
   
   Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes `current_combination` and `index` as parameters.
       If `index` is equal to the length of `elements`, add `current_combination` to `result` and return.
       Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` unchanged and `index + 1` (exclude current element).
       Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` plus the current element and `index + 1` (include current element).
   
   Call `generate_combinations` with an empty list and index 0.
   Return `result`.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # Initialize the result list with an empty list to store all combinations
    result = []

    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If the index is equal to the length of elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
            return
        
        # Exclude the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)
        
        # Include the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)

    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    # Return the result list containing all combinations
    return result
```

This code defines a function `combinations_list` that uses a recursive helper function `generate_combinations` to explore all possible subsets of the input list by including or excluding each element. The result is a list of all combinations, including the empty set.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate all possible combinations (subsets) of a given list.
   - The order of elements in each subset does not matter, but the order of subsets in the result list does matter according to the test case.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The function `combinations_list` uses a recursive approach to generate all subsets.
   - The subsets are generated by either including or excluding each element in the list.
   - The function correctly generates all subsets, but the order of subsets in the result list does not match the expected order in the test case.

3. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The issue is with the order of subsets in the result list. The expected order in the test case is based on the order of elements in the input list.
   - The current implementation generates subsets in a different order because it processes elements from the end of the list to the beginning.

4. **Correcting the Approach:**
   - To match the expected order, we need to ensure that subsets are generated by processing elements from the beginning of the list to the end.
   - This means that when we include an element in a subset, it should be added in the order it appears in the input list.

5. **Revising the Solution:**
   - We need to adjust the recursive function to ensure that subsets are generated in the correct order.

Let's revise the code to address this issue:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # Initialize the result list with an empty list to store all combinations
    result = []

    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If the index is equal to the length of elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
            return
        
        # Include the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)
        
        # Exclude the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)

    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    # Return the result list containing all combinations
    return result
```

In this revised solution, the order of recursive calls is adjusted to first include the current element and then exclude it. This ensures that subsets are generated in the order expected by the test case.

    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations
    Part: 1/1
    # Generating all $K$-combinations

    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.
    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.
    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.

    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label="Generate next lexicographical K-combination"}

    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.
    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how
    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our
    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once
    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent
    elements.

    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}
    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {
        int k = (int)a.size();
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {
                a[i]++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)
                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    ```

    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label="Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element"}

    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such
    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.

    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):
    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.

    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:
    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.
    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the
    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove
    a number, add a number).

    Let us prove this:

    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can 
    be obtained as follows:

    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \cup 1G(N-1)^\text{R}$$

    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the 
    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and
    concatenate these two sequences.

    Now we may produce our proof.

    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note
    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As
    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.
    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.

    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.

    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.

    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size
    $K$.

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}
    int gray_code (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }

    int count_bits (int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (; n; n >>= 1)
            res += n & 1;
        return res;
    }

    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            int cur = gray_code (i);
            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (cur & (1 << j))
                        cout << j + 1;
                }
                cout << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus
    works in $O\left(N \cdot \binom{N}{K}\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant
    than the previous solution.

    The implementation is derived from the formula:

    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\text{R}$$

    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the
    subsequence from appropriate elements.

    Its implementation is as follows:

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}
    vector<int> ans;

    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {
        if (k > n || k < 0)
            return;

        if (!n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {
                if (ans[i])
                    cout << i + 1;
            }
            cout << "\n";
            return;
        }

        ans[idx] = rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);
        ans[idx] = !rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);
    }

    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {
        ans.resize(n);
        gen(n, k, 0, false);
    }
    ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [generation text] Let's address the issue with the order of the subsets in the result list. The problem is that the subsets are being generated in reverse order. To fix this, we need to ensure that when we generate subsets, we first consider excluding the current element and then including it. This will ensure that the subsets are generated in the correct order as expected by the test case.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # Initialize the result list with an empty list to store all combinations
    result = []

    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If the index is equal to the length of elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
            return
        
        # Exclude the current element and move to the next

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of elements and returns all possible combinations (subsets) of those elements. The combinations should include the empty set and all possible subsets of the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find all possible combinations of a list, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to generate subsets by either including or excluding each element in the list. We start with an empty subset and for each element, we create new subsets by adding the element to existing subsets. This process is repeated for all elements in the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function `combinations_list` that takes a list `elements` as input.
   Initialize a list `result` with an empty list to store all combinations.
   
   Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes `current_combination` and `index` as parameters.
       If `index` is equal to the length of `elements`, add `current_combination` to `result` and return.
       Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` unchanged and `index + 1` (exclude current element).
       Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` plus the current element and `index + 1` (include current element).
   
   Call `generate_combinations` with an empty list and index 0.
   Return `result`.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # Initialize the result list with an empty list to store all combinations
    result = []

    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If the index is equal to the length of elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
            return
        
        # Exclude the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)
        
        # Include the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)

    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    # Return the result list containing all combinations
    return result
```

This code defines a function `combinations_list` that uses a recursive helper function `generate_combinations` to explore all possible subsets of the input list by including or excluding each element. The result is a list of all combinations, including the empty set.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate all possible combinations (subsets) of a given list.
   - The order of elements in each subset does not matter, but the order of subsets in the result list does matter according to the test case.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The function `combinations_list` uses a recursive approach to generate all subsets.
   - The subsets are generated by either including or excluding each element in the list.
   - The function correctly generates all subsets, but the order of subsets in the result list does not match the expected order in the test case.

3. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The issue is with the order of subsets in the result list. The expected order in the test case is based on the order of elements in the input list.
   - The current implementation generates subsets in a different order because it processes elements from the end of the list to the beginning.

4. **Correcting the Approach:**
   - To match the expected order, we need to ensure that subsets are generated by processing elements from the beginning of the list to the end.
   - This means that when we include an element in a subset, it should be added in the order it appears in the input list.

5. **Revising the Solution:**
   - We need to adjust the recursive function to ensure that subsets are generated in the correct order.

Let's revise the code to address this issue:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # Initialize the result list with an empty list to store all combinations
    result = []

    # Helper function to generate combinations

   - This means that when we include an element in a subset, it should be added in the order it appears in the input list.

5. **Revising the Solution:**
   - We need to adjust the recursive function to ensure that subsets are generated in the correct order.

Let's revise the code to address this issue:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # Initialize the result list with an empty list to store all combinations
    result = []

    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If the index is equal to the length of elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
            return
        
        # Exclude the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)
        
        # Include the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)

    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    # Return the result list containing all combinations
    return result
```

In this revised solution, the order of recursive calls is adjusted to first exclude the current element and then include it. This ensures that subsets are generated in the order expected by the test case.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate all possible combinations (subsets) of a given list.
   - The order of elements in each subset does not matter, but the order of subsets in the result list does matter according to the test case.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**

   - The subsets are generated by either including or excluding each element in the list.
   - The function correctly generates all subsets, but the order of subsets in the result list does not match the expected order in the test case.

3. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The issue is with the order of subsets in the result list. The expected order in the test case is based on the order of elements in the input list.
   - The current implementation generates subsets in a different order because it processes elements from the end of the list to the beginning.

4. **Correcting the Approach:**
   - To match the expected order, we need to ensure that subsets are generated by processing elements from the beginning of the list to the end.
   - This means that when we include an element in a subset, it should be added in the order it appears in the input list.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of elements and returns all possible combinations (subsets) of those elements. The combinations should include the empty set and all possible subsets of the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find all possible combinations of a list, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to generate subsets by either including or excluding each element in the list. We start with an empty subset and for each element, we create new subsets by adding the element to existing subsets. This process is repeated for all elements in the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function `combinations_list` that takes a list `elements` as input.
   Initialize a list `result` with an empty list to store all combinations.
   
   Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes `current_combination` and `index` as parameters.
       If `index` is equal to the length of `elements`, add `current_combination` to `result` and return.
       Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` unchanged and `index + 1` (exclude current element).
       Call `generate_combinations` with `current_combination` plus the current element and `index + 1` (include current element).
   
   Call `generate_combinations` with an empty list and index 0.
   Return `result`.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # Initialize the result list with an empty list to store all combinations
    result = []

    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If the index is equal to the length of elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
            return
        
        # Exclude the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)
        
        # Include the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)

    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    # Return the result list containing all combinations
    return result
```

This code defines a function `combinations_list` that uses a recursive helper function `generate_combinations` to explore all possible subsets of the input list by including or excluding each element. The result is a list of all combinations, including the empty set.

    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations
    Part: 1/1
    # Generating all $K$-combinations

    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.
    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.
    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.

    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label="Generate next lexicographical K-combination"}

    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.
    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how
    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our
    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once
    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent
    elements.

    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}
    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {
        int k = (int)a.size();
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {
                a[i]++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)
                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    ```

    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label="Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element"}

    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such
    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.

    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):
    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.

    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:
    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.
    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the
    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove
    a number, add a number).

    Let us prove this:

    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can 
    be obtained as follows:

    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \cup 1G(N-1)^\text{R}$$

    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the 
    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and
    concatenate these two sequences.

    Now we may produce our proof.

    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note
    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As
    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.
    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.

    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.

    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.

    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size
    $K$.

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}
    int gray_code (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }

    int count_bits (int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (; n; n >>= 1)
            res += n & 1;
        return res;
    }

    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            int cur = gray_code (i);
            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (cur & (1 << j))
                        cout << j + 1;
                }
                cout << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus
    works in $O\left(N \cdot \binom{N}{K}\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant
    than the previous solution.

    The implementation is derived from the formula:

    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\text{R}$$

    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the
    subsequence from appropriate elements.

    Its implementation is as follows:

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}
    vector<int> ans;

    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {
        if (k > n || k < 0)
            return;

        if (!n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {
                if (ans[i])
                    cout << i + 1;
            }
            cout << "\n";
            return;
        }

        ans[idx] = rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);
        ans[idx] = !rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);
    }

    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {
        ans.resize(n);
        gen(n, k, 0, false);
    }
    ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/462 [generation text] Let's address the issue with the order of the subsets in the result list. The problem is that the subsets are being generated in reverse order. To fix this, we need to ensure that when we generate subsets, we first consider excluding the current element and then including it. This will ensure that the subsets are generated in the correct order as expected by the test case.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def combinations_list(elements):
    # Initialize the result list with an empty list to store all combinations
    result = []

    # Helper function to generate combinations
    def generate_combinations(current_combination, index):
        # If the index is equal to the length of elements, add the current combination to the result
        if index == len(elements):
            result.append(current_combination)
            return
        
        # Exclude the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination, index + 1)
        
        # Include the current element and move to the next
        generate_combinations(current_combination + [elements[index]], index + 1)

    # Start generating combinations from an empty list and index 0
    generate_combinations([], 0)
    
    # Sort the result list to match the expected order
    result.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
    
    # Return the result list containing all combinations
    return result
```

In this revised solution, the order of recursive calls is adjusted to first exclude the current element and then include it. Additionally, the result list is sorted to ensure that subsets are generated in the order expected by the test case.
