    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that calculates the surface area of a regular tetrahedron given the length of its edge. The function should return the calculated area as a floating-point number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   A regular tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four equilateral triangular faces. To find the surface area of a regular tetrahedron, we need to calculate the area of one of its equilateral triangular faces and then multiply that by four (since there are four faces). The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( a \\) is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times a^2\\). Therefore, the surface area of a regular tetrahedron is \\(4 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times a^2 = \\sqrt{3} \\times a^2\\).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function area_tetrahedron(a):\n       Calculate the area of one equilateral triangle face using the formula: (sqrt(3) / 4) * a^2\n       Multiply the area of one face by 4 to get the total surface area of the tetrahedron\n       Return the total surface area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef area_tetrahedron(a: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the area of one equilateral triangle face\n    area_of_one_face = (3**0.5 / 4) * a**2\n    # Multiply by 4 to get the total surface area of the tetrahedron\n    total_area = 4 * area_of_one_face\n    # Return the total surface area\n    return total_area\n```",
