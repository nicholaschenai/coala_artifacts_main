INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/620 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the size of the largest subset of a given list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in this subset is divisible by each other. In other words, for any two numbers `a` and `b` in the subset, either `a % b == 0` or `b % a == 0`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, sort the list of numbers. Sorting helps because if a number `a` is divisible by `b`, then `a` is usually greater than or equal to `b`.
   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the largest divisible subset ending at each element.
   - Initialize a list `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the element at index `i`.
   - For each element in the list, check all previous elements to see if they are divisible. If they are, update the `dp` value for the current element.
   - The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function largest_subset(nums):
       if nums is empty:
           return 0
       
       sort nums
       initialize dp array of size len(nums) with all 1s
       
       for i from 1 to len(nums) - 1:
           for j from 0 to i - 1:
               if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
       
       return max value in dp
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def largest_subset(nums):
    # If the list is empty, the largest subset size is 0
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the numbers to facilitate the divisibility check
    nums.sort()
    
    # Initialize the dp array where each element starts with a subset size of 1
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    
    # Iterate over each number in the sorted list
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        # Check all previous numbers to see if they divide the current number
        for j in range(i):
            # If nums[i] is divisible by nums[j], update the dp[i]
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    # The result is the maximum value in the dp array
    return max(dp)
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/620 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the largest subset of numbers from a given list such that every pair of numbers in this subset is divisible by each other. In other words, for any two numbers in the subset, one should be divisible by the other.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will sort the list of numbers first.

For each number, we will check all previous numbers to see if they are divisible by the current number or vice versa, and update the subset size accordingly.
