    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the largest subset of numbers from a given list such that every pair of numbers in this subset is divisible by each other. In other words, for any two numbers in the subset, one should be divisible by the other.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will sort the list of numbers first. Then, for each number, we will determine the largest subset ending with that number where every pair is divisible. We will keep track of the size of the largest subset found so far. For each number, we will check all previous numbers to see if they are divisible by the current number or vice versa, and update the subset size accordingly.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   1. Sort the list of numbers.\n   2. Initialize a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset ending with the number at index `i`.\n   3. Set all elements of `dp` to 1 because each number is a subset of itself.\n   4. Initialize a variable `max_size` to 1 to keep track of the largest subset size found.\n   5. For each number at index `i` from 1 to n-1:\n      a. For each number at index `j` from 0 to i-1:\n         i. If the number at index `i` is divisible by the number at index `j` or vice versa:\n            - Update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.\n      b. Update `max_size` to be the maximum of `max_size` and `dp[i]`.\n   6. Return `max_size`.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef largest_subset(numbers):\n    # Step 1: Sort the list of numbers\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Step 2: Initialize dp array where dp[i] is the size of the largest subset ending with numbers[i]\n    dp = [1] * len(numbers)\n    \n    # Step 3: Initialize max_size to keep track of the largest subset size found\n    max_size = 1\n    \n    # Step 4: Iterate over each number in the sorted list\n    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):\n        # Step 5: Check all previous numbers to see if they are divisible\n        for j in range(i):\n            if numbers[i] % numbers[j] == 0 or numbers[j] % numbers[i] == 0:\n                # Update dp[i] if a larger subset is found\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n        # Update max_size with the largest subset size found so far\n        max_size = max(max_size, dp[i])\n    \n    # Step 6: Return the size of the largest subset\n    return max_size\n```\n",
