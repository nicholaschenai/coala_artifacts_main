INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/754 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find elements that are common across three lists, but with a specific condition: the elements must appear at the same index in all three lists. The function should return a list of these common elements.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through the indices of the lists.
2. For each index, we will check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same.
3. If they are the same, we will add that element to our result list.
4. Finally, we will return the result list containing all such common elements.

## Pseudocode

```
function extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    initialize an empty list called common_elements
    determine the minimum length of the three lists
    for each index i from 0 to the minimum length - 1:
        if the elements at index i in l1, l2, and l3 are the same:
            add the element to common_elements
    return common_elements
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    # Initialize an empty list to store common elements
    common_elements = []
    
    # Determine the minimum length of the three lists
    min_length = min(len(l1), len(l2), len(l3))
    
    # Iterate over the indices up to the minimum length
    for i in range(min_length):
        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists
        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:
            # If they are the same, add the element to the common_elements list
            common_elements.append(l1[i])
    
    # Return the list of common elements
    return common_elements

    ### Finding the maximum/minimum subarray with constraints

    If the problem condition imposes additional restrictions on the required segment $[l, r]$ (for example, that the length $r-l+1$ of the segment must be within the specified limits), then the described algorithm is likely to be easily generalized to these cases â€” anyway, the problem will still be to find the minimum in the array $s[]$ with the specified additional restrictions.

    ### Two-dimensional case of the problem: search for maximum/minimum submatrix

    The problem described in this article is naturally generalized to large dimensions. For example, in a two-dimensional case, it turns into a search for such a submatrix $[l_1 \ldots r_1, l_2 \ldots r_2]$ of a given matrix, which has the maximum sum of numbers in it.

    Using the solution for the one-dimensional case, it is easy to obtain a solution in $O(n^3)$ for the two-dimensions case:
    we iterate over all possible values of $l_1$ and $r_1$, and calculate the sums from $l_1$ to $r_1$ in each row of the matrix. Now we have the one-dimensional problem of finding the indices $l_2$ and $r_2$ in this array, which can already be solved in linear time.

    **Faster** algorithms for solving this problem are known, but they are not much faster than $O(n^3)$, and are very complex (so complex that many of them are inferior to the trivial algorithm for all reasonable constraints by the hidden constant). Currently, the best known algorithm works in $O\left(n^3 \frac{ \log^3 \log n }{ \log^2 n} \right)$ time (T. Chan 2007 "More algorithms for all-pairs shortest paths in weighted graphs")

    This algorithm by Chan, as well as many other results in this area, actually describe **fast matrix multiplication** (where matrix multiplication means modified multiplication: minimum is used instead of addition, and addition is used instead of multiplication). The problem of finding the submatrix with the largest sum can be reduced to the problem of finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, and this problem, in turn, can be reduced to such a multiplication of matrices.

    ### Search for a subarray with a maximum/minimum average

    This problem lies in finding such a segment $a[l, r]$, such that the average value is maximal:

    $$ \max_{l \le r} \frac{ 1 }{ r-l+1 } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    Of course, if no other conditions are imposed on the required segment $[l, r]$, then the solution will always be a segment of length $1$ at the maximum element of the array. 
    The problem only makes sense, if there are additional restrictions (for example, the length of the desired segment is bounded below).

    In this case, we apply the **standard technique** when working with the problems of the average value: we will select the desired maximum average value by **binary search**.

    To do this, we need to learn how to solve the following subproblem: given the number $x$, and we need to check whether there is a subarray of array $a[]$ (of course, satisfying all additional constraints of the problem), where the average value is greater than $x$.

    To solve this subproblem, subtract $x$ from each element of array $a[]$. Then our subproblem actually turns into this one: whether or not there are positive sum subarrays in this array. And we already know how to solve this problem.

    Thus, we obtained the solution for the asymptotic $O(T(n) \log W)$, where $W$ is the required accuracy, $T(n)$ is the time of solving the subtask for an array of length $n$ (which may vary depending on the specific additional restrictions imposed).

    ### Solving the online problem

    The condition of the problem is as follows: given an array of $n$ numbers, and a number $L$. There are queries of the form $(l,r)$, and in response to each query, it is required to find a subarray of the segment $[l, r]$ of length not less than $L$ with the maximum possible arithmetic mean.

    The algorithm for solving this problem is quite complex. KADR (Yaroslav Tverdokhleb) described his algorithm on the [Russian forum](http://e-maxx.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?id=410).
