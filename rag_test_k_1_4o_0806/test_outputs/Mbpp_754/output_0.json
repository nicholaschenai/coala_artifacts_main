    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find elements that are common across three lists, but with a specific condition: the elements must appear at the same index in all three lists. The function should return a list of these common elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate through the indices of the lists.\n   - For each index, we will check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same.\n   - If they are the same, we will add that element to our result list.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of common elements.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty list called common_elements.\n   For each index i from 0 to the minimum length of the three lists:\n       If the element at index i in all three lists is the same:\n           Add the element to common_elements.\n   Return common_elements.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store common elements\n    common_elements = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices up to the minimum length of the three lists\n    for i in range(min(len(l1), len(l2), len(l3))):\n        # Check if the elements at index i are the same in all three lists\n        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:\n            # If they are the same, add the element to the common_elements list\n            common_elements.append(l1[i])\n    \n    # Return the list of common elements\n    return common_elements\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find and return the list of elements that are common across the three input lists at the same indices.",
