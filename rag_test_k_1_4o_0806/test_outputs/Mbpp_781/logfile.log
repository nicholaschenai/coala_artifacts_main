INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/781 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that checks if the number of divisors of a given integer is even. The function should return `True` if the count of divisors is even, and `False` otherwise.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Divisors**: For a given integer `n`, a divisor is any integer `d` such that `n % d == 0`.
2. **Count Divisors**: Iterate through all integers from 1 to `n` and count how many of them are divisors of `n`.
3. **Check Evenness**: Determine if the count of divisors is even by checking if the count modulo 2 equals zero.
4. **Return Result**: Return `True` if the count is even, otherwise return `False`.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_divisors(n):
    initialize count to 0
    for each integer i from 1 to n:
        if n is divisible by i:
            increment count by 1
    if count is even:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_divisors(n: int) -> bool:
    # Initialize the count of divisors to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # Increment the count of divisors
            count += 1
    
    # Check if the count of divisors is even
    return count % 2 == 0
```

This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, counts how many of them are divisors of `n`, and then checks if this count is even. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

    Title: Number of divisors / sum of divisors
    Part: 1/1
    # Number of divisors / sum of divisors

    In this article we discuss how to compute the number of divisors $d(n)$ and the sum of divisors $\sigma(n)$ of a given number $n$.

    ## Number of divisors

    It should be obvious that the prime factorization of a divisor $d$ has to be a subset of the prime factorization of $n$, e.g. $6 = 2 \cdot 3$ is a divisor of $60 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$.
    So we only need to find all different subsets of the prime factorization of $n$.

    Usually the number of subsets is $2^x$ for a set with $x$ elements.
    However this is no longer true, if there are repeated elements in the set. In our case some prime factors may appear multiple times in the prime factorization of $n$.

    If a prime factor $p$ appears $e$ times in the prime factorization of $n$, then we can use the factor $p$ up to $e$ times in the subset.
    Which means we have $e+1$ choices.

    Therefore if the prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers, then the number of divisors is:

    $$d(n) = (e_1 + 1) \cdot (e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)$$

    A way of thinking about it is the following:

    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then there are obviously $e_1 + 1$ divisors ($1, p_1, p_1^2, \dots, p_1^{e_1}$).

    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then you can arrange all divisors in form of a tabular.

    $$\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
    & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\hline
    1 & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    p_1 & p_1 & p_1 \cdot p_2 & p_1 \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1 \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    p_1^2 & p_1^2 & p_1^2 \cdot p_2 & p_1^2 \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1^2 \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\
    p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2 & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    \end{array}$$

    So the number of divisors is trivially $(e_1 + 1) \cdot (e_2 + 1)$.

    * A similar argument can be made if there are more then two distinct prime factors.


    ```cpp
    long long numberOfDivisors(long long num) {
        long long total = 1;
        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                int e = 0;
                do {
                    e++;
                    num /= i;
                } while (num % i == 0);
                total *= e + 1;
            }
        }
        if (num > 1) {
            total *= 2;
        }
        return total;
    }
    ```

    ## Sum of divisors

    We can use the same argument of the previous section.

    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then the sum is:

    $$1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{e_1} = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1}$$

    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then we can make the same table as before.
      The only difference is that now we now want to compute the sum instead of counting the elements.
      It is easy to see, that the sum of each combination can be expressed as:

    $$\left(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{e_1}\right) \cdot \left(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_2^{e_2}\right)$$

    $$ = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \cdot \frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1}$$

    * In general, for $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ we receive the formula:

    $$\sigma(n) = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \cdot \frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1} \cdots \frac{p_k^{e_k + 1} - 1}{p_k - 1}$$

    ```cpp
    long long SumOfDivisors(long long num) {
        long long total = 1;

        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                int e = 0;
                do {
                    e++;
                    num /= i;
                } while (num % i == 0);

                long long sum = 0, pow = 1;
                do {
                    sum += pow;
                    pow *= i;
                } while (e-- > 0);
                total *= sum;
            }
        }
        if (num > 1) {
            total *= (1 + num);
        }
        return total;
    }
    ```

    ## Multiplicative functions

    A multiplicative function is a function $f(x)$ which satisfies

    $$f(a \cdot b) = f(a) \cdot f(b)$$

    if $a$ and $b$ are coprime.

    Both $d(n)$ and $\sigma(n)$ are multiplicative functions.

    Multiplicative functions have a huge variety of interesting properties, which can be very useful in number theory problems.
    For instance the Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is also multiplicative.

       for each integer i from 1 to n:
           if n is divisible by i:
               increment divisor_count by 1
