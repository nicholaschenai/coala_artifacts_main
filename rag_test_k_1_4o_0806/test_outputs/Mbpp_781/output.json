    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that checks if the number of divisors of a given integer is even. The function should return `True` if the count of divisors is even, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Calculate the number of divisors of the given integer.\n   - Check if this number is even.\n   - Return `True` if it is even, otherwise return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function count_divisors(n):\n       initialize divisor_count to 0\n       for each integer i from 1 to n:\n           if n is divisible by i:\n               increment divisor_count by 1\n       if divisor_count is even:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Initialize the count of divisors to 0\n    divisor_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # Increment the divisor count\n            divisor_count += 1\n    \n    # Check if the count of divisors is even\n    return divisor_count % 2 == 0\n```\n\nThis function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, checks if each number is a divisor, and counts them. Finally, it checks if the count is even and returns the appropriate boolean value.",
