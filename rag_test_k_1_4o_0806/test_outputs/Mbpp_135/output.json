    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth hexagonal number. A hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot at each vertex and along each side. The nth hexagonal number can be calculated using a specific formula.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Hexagonal numbers can be calculated using the formula: \\( H_n = 2n^2 - n \\). This formula gives the nth hexagonal number directly. To solve the problem, we will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer n as input and returns the nth hexagonal number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function hexagonal_num(n):\n       Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula: 2 * n * n - n\n       Return the calculated hexagonal number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef hexagonal_num(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula: 2n^2 - n\n    hexagonal_number = 2 * n * n - n\n    # Return the calculated hexagonal number\n    return hexagonal_number\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth hexagonal number by applying the formula \\( H_n = 2n^2 - n \\).",
