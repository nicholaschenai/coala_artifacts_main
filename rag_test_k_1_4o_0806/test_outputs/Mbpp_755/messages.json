This is important because if the smallest number appears multiple times, we still need to find the second smallest distinct number.\n   \n2. **Sort the Unique Values**: Once we have a list of unique numbers, we can sort this list in ascending order.\n\n3. **Select the Second Smallest**: After sorting, the second element in this sorted list will be the second smallest number.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.\n2. Convert the set back to a list.\n3. Sort the list of unique numbers.\n4. Return the second element from the sorted list.\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    # Step 1: Remove duplicates by converting the list to a set\n    unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n    \n    # Step 2: Convert the set back to a list\n    unique_numbers = list(unique_numbers)\n    \n    # Step 3: Sort the list of unique numbers\n    unique_numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the second element from the sorted list\n    return unique_numbers[1]\n```\n\nThis function will correctly find the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates, sorting the unique numbers, and then selecting the second element from the sorted list."
