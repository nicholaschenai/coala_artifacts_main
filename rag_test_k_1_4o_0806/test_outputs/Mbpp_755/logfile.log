## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the second smallest number in that list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Unique Values**: First, we need to ensure that we are considering only unique numbers in the list. This is important because if the smallest number appears multiple times, we still need to find the second smallest distinct number.
   
2. **Sort the Unique Values**: Once we have a list of unique numbers, we can sort this list in ascending order.

3. **Select the Second Smallest**: After sorting, the second element in this sorted list will be the second smallest number.

## Pseudocode

1. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
2. Convert the set back to a list.
3. Sort the list of unique numbers.
4. Return the second element from the sorted list.

## Python Code

```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    # Step 1: Remove duplicates by converting the list to a set
    unique_numbers = set(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Convert the set back to a list
    unique_numbers = list(unique_numbers)
    
    # Step 3: Sort the list of unique numbers
    unique_numbers.sort()
    
    # Step 4: Return the second element from the sorted list
    return unique_numbers[1]
```

This function will correctly find the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates, sorting the unique numbers, and then selecting the second element from the sorted list.

    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Minimizing sums
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/755 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second smallest number in that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the second smallest number in a list, we can follow these steps:
   - First, sort the list in ascending order.
   - Then, iterate through the sorted list to find the first unique number after the smallest number. This will be the second smallest number.
   - Return this second smallest number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function second_smallest(numbers):
       sort the list 'numbers' in ascending order
       initialize a variable 'first_smallest' to None
       iterate over each number in the sorted list:
           if 'first_smallest' is None, set it to the current number
           else if the current number is greater than 'first_smallest':
               return the current number
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Initialize the first smallest number
    first_smallest = None
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list
    for num in numbers:
        # If first_smallest is not set, set it to the current number
        if first_smallest is None:
            first_smallest = num
        # If the current number is greater than the first smallest, it is the second smallest
        elif num > first_smallest:
            return num
```

This function sorts the list and then finds the second smallest number by checking for the first number that is greater than the smallest number.
