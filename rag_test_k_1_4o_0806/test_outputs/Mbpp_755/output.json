    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second smallest number in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the second smallest number in a list, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, sort the list in ascending order.\n   - Then, iterate through the sorted list to find the first unique number after the smallest number. This will be the second smallest number.\n   - Return this second smallest number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function second_smallest(numbers):\n       sort the list 'numbers' in ascending order\n       initialize a variable 'first_smallest' to None\n       iterate over each number in the sorted list:\n           if 'first_smallest' is None, set it to the current number\n           else if the current number is greater than 'first_smallest':\n               return the current number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    # Sort the list in ascending order\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Initialize the first smallest number\n    first_smallest = None\n    \n    # Iterate over the sorted list\n    for num in numbers:\n        # If first_smallest is not set, set it to the current number\n        if first_smallest is None:\n            first_smallest = num\n        # If the current number is greater than the first smallest, it is the second smallest\n        elif num > first_smallest:\n            return num\n```\n\nThis function sorts the list and then finds the second smallest number by checking for the first number that is greater than the smallest number.",
