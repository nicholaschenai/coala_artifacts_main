    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a dictionary. This dictionary should map each unique tuple to the number of times it appears in the list. If a tuple appears more than once, it should be counted each time it appears.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each tuple. We will iterate through the list of tuples, and for each tuple, we will check if it is already in the dictionary. If it is, we will increment its count by one. If it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of one. After processing all tuples, the dictionary will contain each unique tuple as a key and its count as the value.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty dictionary called occurrences\n   For each tuple in the list of tuples:\n       If the tuple is already a key in occurrences:\n           Increment the value associated with the tuple by 1\n       Else:\n           Add the tuple to occurrences with a value of 1\n   Return the occurrences dictionary\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_occurences(tuples_list):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the occurrences of each tuple\n    occurrences = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list\n    for t in tuples_list:\n        # If the tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if t in occurrences:\n            occurrences[t] += 1\n        # If the tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n        else:\n            occurrences[t] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing each tuple and its count\n    return occurrences\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the occurrences of each tuple in the input list and return a dictionary with the results.",
