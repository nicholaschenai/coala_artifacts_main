Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef check_occurences(tuples_list):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the occurrences of each tuple\n    occurrences = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list\n    for t in tuples_list:\n        # Sort the tuple to ensure (a, b) and (b, a) are treated the same\n        sorted_tuple = tuple(sorted(t))\n        \n        # If the sorted tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if sorted_tuple in occurrences:\n            occurrences[sorted_tuple] += 1\n        # If the sorted tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n        else:\n            occurrences[sorted_tuple] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing each tuple and its count\n    return occurrences\n```\n\nThis code will correctly count the occurrences of each tuple, treating tuples like `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` as the same.",
