INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/237 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a dictionary where each unique tuple (or its reverse) is a key, and the value is the number of times that tuple or its reverse appears in the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each tuple.
   - Iterate over each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, create a sorted version of the tuple to handle both the tuple and its reverse as the same key.
   - If the sorted tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count.
   - If the sorted tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.
   - After processing all tuples, return the dictionary.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function check_occurences(tuples_list):
       initialize an empty dictionary called tuple_count
       for each tuple in tuples_list:
           sort the tuple to handle both tuple and its reverse
           if sorted tuple is in tuple_count:
               increment the count of the sorted tuple
           else:
               add the sorted tuple to tuple_count with a count of 1
       return tuple_count
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_occurences(tuples_list):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each tuple
    tuple_count = {}
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for tup in tuples_list:
        # Sort the tuple to handle both the tuple and its reverse as the same key
        sorted_tup = tuple(sorted(tup))
        
        # If the sorted tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if sorted_tup in tuple_count:
            tuple_count[sorted_tup] += 1
        else:
            # If the sorted tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
            tuple_count[sorted_tup] = 1
    
    # Return the dictionary containing the counts of each tuple
    return tuple_count
```

This solution iterates through the list of tuples, normalizes each tuple by sorting it, and then counts the occurrences of each normalized tuple in a dictionary. The final dictionary is returned, which maps each unique tuple (or its reverse) to its count.

## Memories

[Textbook Reference Material]:
    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/237 [generation text] The issue with the current solution is that it does not account for the fact that tuples like `(3, 1)` and `(1, 3)` should be considered the same for counting purposes. The problem statement implies that tuples should be treated as sets, meaning the order of elements does not matter. Therefore, `(3, 1)` and `(1, 3)` should be counted as the same tuple.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of where the code went wrong:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires treating tuples as sets, meaning `(a, b)` is equivalent to `(b, a)`.
   - The current solution treats tuples as ordered pairs, so `(3, 1)` and `(1, 3)` are considered different.

2. **Where the Code Went Wrong:**
   - The code directly uses tuples as dictionary keys without normalizing them to a consistent order.
   - This results in different keys for tuples that should be considered the same.

3. **Solution to the Problem:**
   - Before adding a tuple to the dictionary, sort the elements of the tuple. This way, `(3, 1)` and `(1, 3)` both become `(1, 3)`.
   - Use the sorted tuple as the key in the dictionary.

Let's update the solution to address this issue:

```python
def check_occurences(tuples_list):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the occurrences of each tuple
    occurrences = {}
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list
    for t in tuples_list:
        # Sort the tuple to ensure (a, b) and (b, a) are treated the same
        sorted_tuple = tuple(sorted(t))
        
        # If the sorted tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if sorted_tuple in occurrences:
            occurrences[sorted_tuple] += 1
        # If the sorted tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
        else:
            occurrences[sorted_tuple] = 1
    
    # Return the dictionary containing each tuple and its count
    return occurrences
```

This updated solution will correctly count tuples as sets, ensuring that `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are treated as the same tuple.

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/237 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a dictionary. This dictionary should map each unique tuple to the number of times it appears in the list. If a tuple appears more than once, it should be counted each time it appears.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of each tuple. We will iterate through the list of tuples, and for each tuple, we will check if it is already in the dictionary. If it is, we will increment its count by one. If it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of one. After processing all tuples, the dictionary will contain each unique tuple as a key and its count as the value.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize an empty dictionary called occurrences
   For each tuple in the list of tuples:
       If the tuple is already a key in occurrences:
           Increment the value associated with the tuple by 1
       Else:
           Add the tuple to occurrences with a value of 1
   Return the occurrences dictionary
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_occurences(tuples_list):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the occurrences of each tuple
    occurrences = {}
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list
    for t in tuples_list:
        # If the tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if t in occurrences:
            occurrences[t] += 1
        # If the tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
        else:
            occurrences[t] = 1
    
    # Return the dictionary containing each tuple and its count
    return occurrences
```

This function will correctly count the occurrences of each tuple in the input list and return a dictionary with the results.

[Textbook Reference Material]:
    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }
