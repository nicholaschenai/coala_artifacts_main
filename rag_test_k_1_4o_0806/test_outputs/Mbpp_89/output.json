    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   The task is to write a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the closest smaller integer than `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the closest smaller number than `n`, we simply need to subtract 1 from `n`. This is because the closest integer less than any given integer `n` is `n-1`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function closest_num(n):\n       return n - 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef closest_num(n: int) -> int:\n    # Subtract 1 from n to get the closest smaller number\n    return n - 1\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` and returns `n-1`, which is the closest smaller integer.",
