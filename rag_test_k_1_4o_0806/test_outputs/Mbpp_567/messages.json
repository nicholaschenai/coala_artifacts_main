If the list is sorted, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through the list and compare each element with the next one.\n   - If we find any element that is greater than the next element, we can conclude that the list is not sorted and return `False`.\n   - If we complete the iteration without finding any such pair, the list is sorted, and we return `True`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function issort_list that takes a list as input\n       For each index i from 0 to length of list - 2\n           If the element at index i is greater than the element at index i + 1\n               Return False\n       Return True\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef issort_list(lst):\n    # Iterate through the list up to the second last element\n    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):\n        # Compare the current element with the next element\n        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:\n            # If the current element is greater, the list is not sorted\n            return False\n    # If no such pair is found, the list is sorted\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by checking each pair of consecutive elements. If any element is found to be greater than the next, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements."
