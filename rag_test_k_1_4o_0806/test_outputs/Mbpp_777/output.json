    "raw_msg": "Let's revisit the problem and the test case to ensure we understand the requirements correctly.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a list.\n   - Non-repeated elements are those that appear only once in the list.\n\n2. **Re-evaluating the Test Case:**\n   - The input list is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`.\n   - The expected output is `21`.\n   - The numbers that appear only once in the list are `2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.\n   - The sum of these numbers is `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`.\n\n3. **Reassessing the Code:**\n   - The code was modified to include the first occurrence of repeated elements, which was incorrect.\n   - This led to an incorrect sum of `23` because it added the first occurrence of `1` twice.\n\n4. **Identifying the Mistake:**\n   - The mistake was in the interpretation of the problem. The problem requires summing only those elements that appear exactly once, not including any repeated elements.\n\n5. **Correcting the Solution:**\n   - We need to revert to the original understanding: sum only those elements that appear exactly once in the list.\n\nLet's correct the solution to align with the original problem statement:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count each element in the list\n    for num in lst:\n        if num in count_dict:\n            count_dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[num] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize sum of unique elements\n    sum_unique = 0\n    \n    # Sum up elements that appear only once\n    for num, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count == 1:\n            sum_unique += num\n    \n    return sum_unique\n```\n\nThis solution correctly calculates the sum of elements that appear only once in the list. The expected output for the test case `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]` should indeed be `20`, as the sum of the unique elements `2, 3, 4, 5, 6` is `20`. The test case expectation of `21` seems to be incorrect based on the problem statement.",
