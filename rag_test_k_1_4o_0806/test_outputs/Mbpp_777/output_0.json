    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all numbers that appear only once in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to identify which numbers in the list are unique, meaning they appear only once.\n   - We can do this by counting the occurrences of each number in the list.\n   - Once we have the counts, we can sum up the numbers that have a count of exactly one.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function `find_sum` that takes a list `lst` as input.\n   Create an empty dictionary `count_dict` to store the count of each element.\n   For each element `num` in `lst`:\n       If `num` is not in `count_dict`, add it with a count of 1.\n       Otherwise, increment the count of `num` in `count_dict`.\n   Initialize a variable `sum_unique` to 0.\n   For each key-value pair in `count_dict`:\n       If the value (count) is 1, add the key (number) to `sum_unique`.\n   Return `sum_unique`.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count each element in the list\n    for num in lst:\n        if num in count_dict:\n            count_dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[num] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize sum of unique elements\n    sum_unique = 0\n    \n    # Sum up elements that appear only once\n    for num, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count == 1:\n            sum_unique += num\n    \n    return sum_unique\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `find_sum` which calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list by first counting the occurrences of each element and then summing those that appear exactly once.",
