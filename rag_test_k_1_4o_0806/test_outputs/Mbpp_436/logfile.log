INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/436 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the negative numbers from the original list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through each number in the input list.
   - For each number, we will check if it is negative (i.e., less than zero).
   - If a number is negative, we will add it to a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list containing all the negative numbers.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function neg_nos with parameter nums (a list of integers)
       Initialize an empty list called negative_numbers
       For each number in nums
           If the number is less than zero
               Append the number to negative_numbers
       Return negative_numbers
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def neg_nos(nums):
    # Initialize an empty list to store negative numbers
    negative_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # Check if the number is negative
        if num < 0:
            # If negative, append it to the negative_numbers list
            negative_numbers.append(num)
    
    # Return the list of negative numbers
    return negative_numbers
```

This function will correctly filter out and return only the negative numbers from the input list.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
