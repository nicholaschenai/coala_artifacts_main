INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/616 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes two tuples of the same length and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain the result of performing the modulo operation on corresponding elements from the two input tuples.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input**: Two tuples of the same length.
2. **Output**: A new tuple where each element is the result of the modulo operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples.
3. **Process**:
   - Iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements, compute the modulo of the first element by the second element.
   - Collect these results into a new tuple.
   - Return the new tuple.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `tuple_modulo` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
2. Initialize an empty list `result`.
3. Loop over the indices of the tuples:
   - Compute the modulo of the element at the current index in `tuple1` by the element at the same index in `tuple2`.
   - Append the result to the `result` list.
4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple.
5. Return the resulting tuple.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def tuple_modulo(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the modulo operations
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Compute the modulo of the elements at the current index
        mod_result = tuple1[i] % tuple2[i]
        # Append the result to the list
        result.append(mod_result)
    
    # Convert the list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)

    ## Solution for not coprime moduli

    As mentioned, the algorithm above only works for coprime moduli $m_1, m_2, \dots m_k$.

    In the not coprime case, a system of congruences has exactly one solution modulo $\text{lcm}(m_1, m_2, \dots, m_k)$, or has no solution at all.

    E.g. in the following system, the first congruence implies that the solution is odd, and the second congruence implies that the solution is even.
    It's not possible that a number is both odd and even, therefore there is clearly no solution.

    $$\left\{\begin{align}
        a & \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\
        a & \equiv 2 \pmod{6}
    \end{align}\right.$$

    It is pretty simple to determine is a system has a solution.
    And if it has one, we can use the original algorithm to solve a slightly modified system of congruences.

    A single congruence $a \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i}$ is equivalent to the system of congruences $a \equiv a_i \pmod{p_j^{n_j}}$ where $p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2}\cdots p_k^{n_k}$ is the prime factorization of $m_i$.

    With this fact, we can modify the system of congruences into a system, that only has prime powers as moduli.
    E.g. the above system of congruences is equivalent to:

    $$\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
        a \equiv 1          & \pmod{4} \\
        a \equiv 2 \equiv 0 & \pmod{2} \\
        a \equiv 2          & \pmod{3}
    \end{array}\right.$$

    Because originally some moduli had common factors, we will get some congruences moduli based on the same prime, however possibly with different prime powers.

    You can observe, that the congruence with the highest prime power modulus will be the strongest congruence of all congruences based on the same prime number.
    Either it will give a contradiction with some other congruence, or it will imply already all other congruences.

    In our case, the first congruence $a \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ implies $a \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$, and therefore contradicts the second congruence $a \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$.
    Therefore this system of congruences has no solution.

    If there are no contradictions, then the system of equation has a solution.
    We can ignore all congruences except the ones with the highest prime power moduli.
    These moduli are now coprime, and therefore we can solve this one with the algorithm discussed in the sections above.

    E.g. the following system has a solution modulo $\text{lcm}(10, 12) = 60$.

    $$\left\{\begin{align}
        a & \equiv 3 \pmod{10} \\
        a & \equiv 5 \pmod{12}
    \end{align}\right.$$

    The system of congruence is equivalent to the system of congruences:

    $$\left\{\begin{align}
        a & \equiv 3 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \\
        a & \equiv 3 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \\
        a & \equiv 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\
        a & \equiv 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}
    \end{align}\right.$$

    The only congruence with same prime modulo are $a \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ and $a \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$.
    The first one already implies the second one, so we can ignore the second one, and solve the following system with coprime moduli instead:

    $$\left\{\begin{align}
        a & \equiv 3 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \\
        a & \equiv 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\
        a & \equiv 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}
    \end{align}\right.$$

    It has the solution $53 \pmod{60}$, and indeed $53 \bmod{10} = 3$ and $53 \bmod{12} = 5$.

    ## Garner's Algorithm

    Another consequence of the CRT is that we can represent big numbers using an array of small integers.

    Instead of doing a lot of computations with very large numbers numbers, which might be expensive (think of doing divisions with 1000-digit numbers), you can pick a couple of coprime moduli and represent the large number as a system of congruences, and perform all operations on the system of equations.
    Any number $a$ less than $m_1 m_2 \cdots m_k$ can be represented as an array $a_1, \ldots, a_k$, where $a \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i}$.

    By using the above algorithm, you can again reconstruct the large number whenever you need it.

    Alternatively you can represent the number in the **mixed radix** representation:

    $$a = x_1 + x_2 m_1 + x_3 m_1 m_2 + \ldots + x_k m_1 \cdots m_{k-1} \text{ with }x_i \in [0, m_i)$$

    Garner's algorithm, which is discussed in the dedicated article [Garner's algorithm](garners-algorithm.md), computes the coefficients $x_i$.
    And with those coefficients you can restore the full number.
