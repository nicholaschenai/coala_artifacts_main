INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/563 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the values that are enclosed within double quotation marks. The function should return these values as a list of strings.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through the input string and look for double quotation marks.
   - When we find an opening quotation mark, we will start collecting characters until we find the corresponding closing quotation mark.
   - Once we find the closing quotation mark, we will store the collected characters as a string in a list.
   - We will continue this process until we have processed the entire string.
   - Finally, we will return the list of extracted strings.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function extract_values with parameter input_string
       Initialize an empty list called results
       Initialize a variable i to 0
       While i is less than the length of input_string
           If the character at index i is a double quote
               Increment i to move past the opening quote
               Initialize an empty string called value
               While i is less than the length of input_string and character at index i is not a double quote
                   Append character at index i to value
                   Increment i
               Append value to results
           Increment i
       Return results
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def extract_values(input_string: str) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted values
    results = []
    # Initialize a counter to iterate through the string
    i = 0
    # Loop through the string
    while i < len(input_string):
        # Check if the current character is a double quote
        if input_string[i] == '"':
            # Move to the next character after the opening quote
            i += 1
            # Initialize an empty string to collect the value
            value = ''
            # Collect characters until the next double quote is found
            while i < len(input_string) and input_string[i] != '"':
                value += input_string[i]
                i += 1
            # Add the collected value to the results list
            results.append(value)
        # Move to the next character
        i += 1
    # Return the list of extracted values
    return results
```

This solution iterates through the input string, identifies substrings enclosed in double quotes, and collects them into a list, which is then returned.

    Title: Expression parsing
    Part: 1/2
    # Expression parsing

    A string containing a mathematical expression containing numbers and various operators is given.
    We have to compute the value of it in $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.

    The algorithm discussed here translates an expression into the so-called **reverse Polish notation** (explicitly or implicitly), and evaluates this expression.

    ## Reverse Polish notation

    The reverse Polish notation is a form of writing mathematical expressions, in which the operators are located after their operands.
    For example the following expression

    $$a + b * c * d + (e - f) * (g * h + i)$$

    can be written in reverse Polish notation in the following way:

    $$a b c * d * + e f - g h * i + * +$$

    The reverse Polish notation was developed by the Australian philosopher and computer science specialist Charles Hamblin in the mid 1950s on the basis of the Polish notation, which was proposed in 1920 by the Polish mathematician Jan Łukasiewicz.

    The convenience of the reverse Polish notation is, that expressions in this form are very **easy to evaluate** in linear time.
    We use a stack, which is initially empty.
    We will iterate over the operands and operators of the expression in reverse Polish notation.
    If the current element is a number, then we put the value on top of the stack, if the current element is an operator, then we get the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and put the result back on top of the stack.
    In the end there will be exactly one element left in the stack, which will be the value of the expression.

    Obviously this simple evaluation runs in $O(n)$ time.

    ## Parsing of simple expressions

    For the time being we only consider a simplified problem:
    we assume that all operators are **binary** (i.e. they take two arguments), and all are **left-associative** (if the priorities are equal, they get executed from left to right).
    Parentheses are allowed.

    We will set up two stacks: one for numbers, and one for operators and parentheses.
    Initially both stacks are empty.
    For the second stack we will maintain the condition that all operations are ordered by strict descending priority.
    If there are parenthesis on the stack, than each block of operators (corresponding to one pair of parenthesis) is ordered, and the entire stack is not necessarily ordered.

    We will iterate over the characters of the expression from left to right.
    If the current character is a digit, then we put the value of this number on the stack.
    If the current character is an opening parenthesis, then we put it on the stack.
    If the current character is a closing parenthesis, the we execute all operators on the stack until we reach the opening bracket (in other words we perform all operations inside the parenthesis).
    Finally if the current character is an operator, then while the top of the stack has an operator with the same or higher priority, we will execute this operation, and put the new operation on the stack.

    After we processed the entire string, some operators might still be in the stack, so we execute them.

    Here is the implementation of this method for the four operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$:

    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_simple}
    bool delim(char c) {
        return c == ' ';
    }

    bool is_op(char c) {
        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';
    }

    int priority (char op) {
        if (op == '+' || op == '-')
            return 1;
        if (op == '*' || op == '/')
            return 2;
        return -1;
    }

    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {
        int r = st.top(); st.pop();
        int l = st.top(); st.pop();
        switch (op) {
            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;
            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;
            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;
            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;
        }
    }

    int evaluate(string& s) {
        stack<int> st;
        stack<char> op;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {
            if (delim(s[i]))
                continue;
        
            if (s[i] == '(') {
                op.push('(');
            } else if (s[i] == ')') {
                while (op.top() != '(') {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.pop();
            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {
                char cur_op = s[i];
                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.push(cur_op);
            } else {
                int number = 0;
                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))
                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';
                --i;
                st.push(number);
            }
        }

        while (!op.empty()) {
            process_op(st, op.top());
            op.pop();
        }
        return st.top();
    }
    ```

    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.
    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.

    ## Unary operators

    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).
    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.

    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.

    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).
    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.
    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. 

    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.
    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.

    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.

    ## Right-associativity

    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.

    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.
    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \wedge b \wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).

    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?
    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.
    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.

    The only line that needs to be replaced is
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))
    ```
    with
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && (
            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||
            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))
        ))
