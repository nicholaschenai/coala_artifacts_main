    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the values that are enclosed within quotation marks. The function should return these values as a list of strings.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and look for pairs of quotation marks. Whenever we find a pair, we extract the substring between them and add it to a list. We continue this process until we have processed the entire string. Finally, we return the list of extracted values.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty list called 'values'\n   Initialize a variable 'start' to None\n\n   For each character in the string, along with its index:\n       If the character is a quotation mark:\n           If 'start' is None:\n               Set 'start' to the current index + 1\n           Else:\n               Extract the substring from 'start' to the current index\n               Append the substring to 'values'\n               Set 'start' to None\n\n   Return the 'values' list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_values(s: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted values\n    values = []\n    # Initialize a variable to track the start index of a quoted string\n    start = None\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the string along with its index\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        # Check if the character is a quotation mark\n        if char == '\"':\n            # If 'start' is None, this is the opening quote\n            if start is None:\n                # Set 'start' to the index after the opening quote\n                start = i + 1\n            else:\n                # This is the closing quote, extract the substring\n                value = s[start:i]\n                # Append the extracted value to the list\n                values.append(value)\n                # Reset 'start' to None for the next pair of quotes\n                start = None\n\n    # Return the list of extracted values\n    return values\n```",
