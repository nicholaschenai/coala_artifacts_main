The function should return these values as a list of strings.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate through the input string and look for double quotation marks.\n   - When we find an opening quotation mark, we will start collecting characters until we find the corresponding closing quotation mark.\n   - Once we find the closing quotation mark, we will store the collected characters as a string in a list.\n   - We will continue this process until we have processed the entire string.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of extracted strings.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function extract_values with parameter input_string\n       Initialize an empty list called results\n       Initialize a variable i to 0\n       While i is less than the length of input_string\n           If the character at index i is a double quote\n               Increment i to move past the opening quote\n               Initialize an empty string called value\n               While i is less than the length of input_string and character at index i is not a double quote\n                   Append character at index i to value\n                   Increment i\n               Append value to results\n           Increment i\n       Return results\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_values(input_string: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted values\n    results = []\n    # Initialize a counter to iterate through the string\n    i = 0\n    # Loop through the string\n    while i < len(input_string):\n        # Check if the current character is a double quote\n        if input_string[i] == '\"':\n            # Move to the next character after the opening quote\n            i += 1\n            # Initialize an empty string to collect the value\n            value = ''\n            # Collect characters until the next double quote is found\n            while i < len(input_string) and input_string[i] != '\"':\n                value += input_string[i]\n                i += 1\n            # Add the collected value to the results list\n            results.append(value)\n        # Move to the next character\n        i += 1\n    # Return the list of extracted values\n    return results\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the input string, identifies substrings enclosed in double quotes, and collects them into a list, which is then returned."

st.pop();\n        int l = st.top(); st.pop();\n        switch (op) {\n            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;\n            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;\n            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;\n            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    int evaluate(string& s) {\n        stack<int> st;\n        stack<char> op;\n        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {\n            if (delim(s[i]))\n                continue;\n        \n            if (s[i] == '(') {\n                op.push('(');\n            } else if (s[i] == ')') {\n                while (op.top() != '(') {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.pop();\n            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {\n                char cur_op = s[i];\n                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {\n                    process_op(st, op.top());\n                    op.pop();\n                }\n                op.push(cur_op);\n            } else {\n                int number = 0;\n                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))\n                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';\n                --i;\n                st.push(number);\n            }\n        }\n\n        while (!op.empty()) {\n            process_op(st, op.top());\n            op.pop();\n        }\n        return st.top();\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.\n    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.\n\n    ## Unary operators\n\n    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).\n    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.\n\n    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.\n\n    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).\n    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.\n    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. \n\n    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.\n    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.\n\n    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.\n\n    ## Right-associativity\n\n    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.\n\n    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.\n    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \\wedge b \\wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).\n\n    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?\n    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.\n    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.\n\n    The only line that needs to be replaced is\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))\n    ```\n    with\n    ```cpp\n    while (!op.empty() && (\n            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||\n            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))\n        ))\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
