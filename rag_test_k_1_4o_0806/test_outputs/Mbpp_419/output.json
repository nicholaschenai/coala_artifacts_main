    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The function should return this final result.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, round each number in the list to the nearest integer.\n   - Calculate the sum of these rounded numbers.\n   - Determine the length of the list.\n   - Multiply the sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the list.\n   - Return the result of this multiplication.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function round_and_sum with parameter numbers (a list of floats)\n       Initialize a variable rounded_sum to 0\n       For each number in numbers\n           Round the number to the nearest integer\n           Add the rounded number to rounded_sum\n       Calculate the length of the numbers list\n       Multiply rounded_sum by the length of the list\n       Return the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef round_and_sum(numbers):\n    # Initialize the sum of rounded numbers\n    rounded_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Round the number and add it to the rounded_sum\n        rounded_sum += round(number)\n    \n    # Calculate the length of the list\n    length_of_list = len(numbers)\n    \n    # Multiply the sum of rounded numbers by the length of the list\n    result = rounded_sum * length_of_list\n    \n    # Return the final result\n    return result\n```",
