    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a cube when given the length of one of its sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The volume of a cube can be calculated by raising the length of its side to the power of three. This is because a cube is a three-dimensional shape with equal side lengths, and its volume is the product of its length, width, and height, which are all the same.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named volume_cube that takes one parameter, side_length.\n   Calculate the volume by cubing the side_length (side_length * side_length * side_length).\n   Return the calculated volume.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef volume_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the volume of the cube by cubing the side length\n    volume = side_length ** 3\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```",
