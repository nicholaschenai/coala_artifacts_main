INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/234 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a cube. The function will take the length of one side of the cube as input and return the volume of the cube.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The volume of a cube can be calculated using the formula: \( \text{Volume} = \text{side}^3 \), where "side" is the length of one side of the cube. 
   - The function will take one argument, which is the side length of the cube, and return the result of raising this side length to the power of 3.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `volume_cube` that takes one parameter `side`.
   - Calculate the volume by raising `side` to the power of 3.
   - Return the calculated volume.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def volume_cube(side: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the volume of the cube by raising the side length to the power of 3
    volume = side ** 3
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
```

This function will correctly compute the volume of a cube given the side length, as demonstrated by the assertion `assert volume_cube(3) == 27`.

    Title: Basic Geometry
    Part: 2/3
    ```

    To see the next important property we should take a look at the set of points $\mathbf r$ for which $\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf a = C$ for some fixed constant $C$.
    You can see that this set of points is exactly the set of points for which the projection onto $\mathbf a$ is the point $C \cdot \dfrac{\mathbf a}{|\mathbf a|}$ and they form a hyperplane orthogonal to $\mathbf a$.
    You can see the vector $\mathbf a$ alongside with several such vectors having same dot product with it in 2D on the picture below:

    <center>![Vectors having same dot product with a](https://i.imgur.com/eyO7St4.png)</center>

    In 2D these vectors will form a line, in 3D they will form a plane.
    Note that this result allows us to define a line in 2D as $\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n=C$ or $(\mathbf r - \mathbf r_0)\cdot \mathbf n=0$ where $\mathbf n$ is vector orthogonal to the line and $\mathbf r_0$ is any vector already present on the line and $C = \mathbf r_0\cdot \mathbf n$.
    In the same manner a plane can be defined in 3D.

    ## Cross product

    ### Definition

    Assume you have three vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ in 3D space joined in a parallelepiped as in the picture below:
    <center>![Three vectors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Parallelepiped_volume.svg/240px-Parallelepiped_volume.svg.png)</center>

    How would you calculate its volume?
    From school we know that we should multiply the area of the base with the height, which is projection of $\mathbf a$ onto direction orthogonal to base.
    That means that if we define $\mathbf b \times \mathbf c$ as the vector which is orthogonal to both $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ and which length is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ then $|\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times\mathbf c)|$ will be equal to the volume of the parallelepiped.
    For integrity we will say that $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ will be always directed in such way that the rotation from the vector $\mathbf b$ to the vector $\mathbf c$ from the point of $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ is always counter-clockwise (see the picture below).

    <center>![cross product](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Cross_product_vector.svg/250px-Cross_product_vector.svg.png)</center>

    This defines the cross (or vector) product $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ of the vectors $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ and the triple product $\mathbf a\cdot(\mathbf b\times \mathbf c)$ of the vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$.

    Some notable properties of cross and triple products:

    1.  $\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = -\mathbf b\times \mathbf a$
    2.  $(\alpha \cdot \mathbf a)\times \mathbf b = \alpha \cdot (\mathbf a\times \mathbf b)$
    3.  For any $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ there is exactly one vector $\mathbf r$ such that $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf a\cdot\mathbf r$ for any vector $\mathbf a$. <br>Indeed if there are two such vectors $\mathbf r_1$ and $\mathbf r_2$ then $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf r_1 - \mathbf r_2)=0$ for all vectors $\mathbf a$ which is possible only when $\mathbf r_1 = \mathbf r_2$.
    4.  $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf b\cdot (\mathbf c\times \mathbf a) = -\mathbf a\cdot( \mathbf c\times \mathbf b)$
    5.  $(\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c = \mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c$.
        Indeed for all vectors $\mathbf r$ the chain of equations holds:

        \[\mathbf r\cdot( (\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c) = (\mathbf a + \mathbf b) \cdot (\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) =  \mathbf a \cdot(\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) + \mathbf b\cdot(\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) = \mathbf r\cdot (\mathbf a\times \mathbf c) + \mathbf r\cdot(\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf r\cdot(\mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c)\]

        Which proves $(\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c = \mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ due to point 3.

    6.  $|\mathbf a\times \mathbf b|=|\mathbf a| \cdot |\mathbf b| \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is angle between $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$, since $|\mathbf a\times \mathbf b|$ equals to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$. 

    Given all this and that the following equation holds for the unit vectors

    $$\mathbf e_x\times \mathbf e_x = \mathbf e_y\times \mathbf e_y = \mathbf e_z\times \mathbf e_z = \mathbf 0,\\
    \mathbf e_x\times \mathbf e_y = \mathbf e_z,~\mathbf e_y\times \mathbf e_z = \mathbf e_x,~\mathbf e_z\times \mathbf e_x = \mathbf e_y$$

    we can calculate the cross product of $\mathbf a = (x_1;y_1;z_1)$ and $\mathbf b = (x_2;y_2;z_2)$ in coordinate form:

    $$\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = (x_1 \cdot \mathbf e_x + y_1 \cdot \mathbf e_y + z_1 \cdot \mathbf e_z)\times (x_2 \cdot \mathbf e_x + y_2 \cdot \mathbf e_y + z_2 \cdot \mathbf e_z) =$$

    $$(y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2)\mathbf e_x  + (z_1 x_2 - x_1 z_2)\mathbf e_y + (x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2)$$

    Which also can be written in the more elegant form:

    $$\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = \begin{vmatrix}\mathbf e_x & \mathbf e_y & \mathbf e_z \\ x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \end{vmatrix},~a\cdot(b\times c) = \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\ x_3 & y_3 & z_3 \end{vmatrix}$$

    Here $| \cdot |$ stands for the determinant of a matrix. 

    Some kind of cross product (namely the pseudo-scalar product) can also be implemented in the 2D case.
    If we would like to calculate the area of parallelogram formed by vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ we would compute $|\mathbf e_z\cdot(\mathbf a\times \mathbf b)| = |x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2|$.
    Another way to obtain the same result is to multiply $|\mathbf a|$ (base of parallelogram) with the height, which is the projection of vector $\mathbf b$ onto vector $\mathbf a$ rotated by $90^\circ$ which in turn is $\widehat{\mathbf a}=(-y_1;x_1)$.
    That is, to calculate $|\widehat{\mathbf a}\cdot\mathbf b|=|x_1y_2 - y_1 x_2|$. 

    If we will take the sign into consideration then the area will be positive if the rotation from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ (i.e. from the view of the point of $\mathbf e_z$) is performed counter-clockwise and negative otherwise.
    That defines the pseudo-scalar product.
    Note that it also equals $|\mathbf a| \cdot |\mathbf b| \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is angle from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ count counter-clockwise (and negative if rotation is clockwise).

    Let's implement all this stuff!

    ```{.cpp file=crossproduct}
    point3d cross(point3d a, point3d b) {
        return point3d(a.y * b.z - a.z * b.y,
                       a.z * b.x - a.x * b.z,
                       a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x);
    }
    ftype triple(point3d a, point3d b, point3d c) {
        return dot(a, cross(b, c));
    }
    ftype cross(point2d a, point2d b) {
        return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;
    }
