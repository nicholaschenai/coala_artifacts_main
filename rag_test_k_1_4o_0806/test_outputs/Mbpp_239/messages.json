Each element must be at least twice the previous element and must not exceed a given maximum value `m`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - Each sequence starts with a positive integer.\n   - Each subsequent element must be at least twice the previous element.\n   - No element can exceed `m`.\n   - The sequence must be exactly of length `n`.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n   - Use a recursive function to explore all possible sequences.\n   - Start with the first element and try all possible values from 1 to `m`.\n   - For each element, recursively determine the next element by ensuring it is at least twice the current element and does not exceed `m`.\n   - Count sequences that reach the desired length `n`.\n\n3. **Recursive Function**:\n   - Define a recursive function `count_sequences(current_value, current_length)`:\n     - If `current_length` equals `n`, return 1 (a valid sequence is found).\n     - Initialize a counter to zero.\n     - For each possible next value (from `2 * current_value` to `m`), recursively call the function to extend the sequence.\n     - Accumulate the count of valid sequences.\n   - Start the recursion with `current_value` as 1 and `current_length` as 1.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_sequences(current_value, current_length):\n    if current_length == n:\n        return 1\n    count = 0\n    for next_value from 2 * current_value to m:\n        count += count_sequences(next_value, current_length + 1)\n    return count\n\nfunction get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    total_count = 0\n    for start_value from 1 to m:\n        total_count += count_sequences(start_value, 1)\n    return total_count\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_sequences(current_value, current_length, m, n):\n    # Base case: if the sequence length is n, we have a valid sequence\n    if current_length == n:\n        return 1\n    \n    count = 0\n    # Try all possible next values that are at least twice the current value\n    for next_value in range(2 * current_value, m + 1):\n        count += count_sequences(next_value, current_length + 1, m, n)\n    \n    return count\n\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    total_count = 0\n    # Start sequences with each possible starting value from 1 to m\n    for start_value in range(1, m + 1):\n        total_count += count_sequences(start_value, 1, m, n)\n    \n    return total_count\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive approach to explore all possible sequences, ensuring each element is at least twice the previous one and does not exceed `m`. The function `get_total_number_of_sequences` initializes the process by trying all possible starting values."

You want to count the number of integers in the interval $[1; r]$ that are multiple of at least one of the $a_i$.\n\n    The solution algorithm is almost identical to the one for previous task \u2014 construct the formula of inclusion-exclusion on the numbers $a_i$, i.e. each term in this formula is the number of numbers divisible by a given subset of numbers $a_i$ (in other words, divisible by their [least common multiple](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md)).\n\n    So we will now iterate over all $2^n$ subsets of integers $a_i$ with $O(n \\log r)$ operations to find their least common multiple, adding or subtracting the number of multiples of it in the interval. Asymptotics is $O (2^n\\cdot n\\cdot \\log r)$.\n\n    ### The number of strings that satisfy a given pattern\n\n    Consider $n$ patterns of strings of the same length, consisting only of letters ($a...z$) or question marks. You're also given a number $k$. A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. The task is to count the number of strings that match exactly $k$ of the patterns (first problem) and at least $k$ of the patterns (second problem).\n\n    Notice first that we can easily count the number of strings that satisfy at once all of the specified patterns. To do this, simply \"cross\" patterns: iterate though the positions (\"slots\") and look at a position over all patterns. If all patterns have a question mark in this position, the character can be any letter from $a$ to $z$. Otherwise, the character of this position is uniquely defined by the patterns that do not contain a question mark.\n\n    Learn now to solve the first version of the problem: when the string must satisfy exactly $k$ of the patterns.\n\n    To solve it, iterate and fix a specific subset $X$ from the set of patterns consisting of $k$ patterns. Then we have to count the number of strings that satisfy this set of patterns, and only matches it, that is, they don't match any other pattern. We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a slightly different manner: we sum on all supersets $Y$ (subsets from the original set of strings that contain $X$), and either add to the current answer or subtract it from the number of strings:\n\n    $$ ans(X) = \\sum_{Y \\supseteq X} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \\cdot f(Y) $$\n\n    Where $f(Y)$ is the number of strings that match $Y$ (at least $Y$).\n\n    (If you have a hard time figuring out this, you can try drawing Venn Diagrams.)\n\n    If we sum up on all $ans(X)$, we will get the final answer:\n\n    $$ ans = \\sum_{X ~ : ~ |X| = k} ans(X) $$\n\n    However, asymptotics of this solution is $O(3^k \\cdot k)$. To improve it, notice that different $ans(X)$ computations very often share $Y$ sets.\n\n    We will reverse the formula of inclusion-exclusion and sum in terms of $Y$ sets. Now it becomes clear that the same set $Y$ would be taken into account in the computation of $ans(X)$ of $\\binom{|Y|}{k}$ sets with the same sign $(-1)^{|Y| - k}$.\n\n    $$ ans = \\sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \\ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|}{k} \\cdot f(Y) $$\n\n    Now our solution has asymptotics $O(2^k \\cdot k)$.\n\n    We will now solve the second version of the problem: find the number of strings that match **at least** $k$ of the patterns.\n\n    Of course, we can just use the solution to the first version of the problem and add the answers for sets with size greater than $k$. However, you may notice that in this problem, a set |Y| is considered in the formula for all sets with size $\\ge k$ which are contained in $Y$. That said, we can write the part of the expression that is being multiplied by $f(Y)$ as:\n\n\n    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|}{k} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-1} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|}{k+1} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-2} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|}{k+2} + \\cdots + (-1)^{|Y|-|Y|} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|}{|Y|} $$\n\n    Looking at Graham's (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. \"Concrete mathematics\" [1998] ), we see a well-known formula for [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):\n\n    $$ \\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \\cdot \\binom{n}{k} = (-1)^m \\cdot \\binom{n-1}{m} $$\n\n    Applying it here, we find that the entire sum of binomial coefficients is minimized:\n\n    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} $$\n\n    Thus, for this task, we also obtained a solution with the asymptotics $O(2^k \\cdot k)$:\n\n    $$ ans = \\sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \\ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} \\cdot f(Y) $$\n\n    ### The number of ways of going from a cell to another\n\n    There is a field $n \\times m$, and $k$ of its cells are impassable walls. A robot is initially at the cell $(1,1)$ (bottom left). The robot can only move right or up, and eventually it needs to get into the cell $(n,m)$, avoiding all obstacles. You need to count the number of ways he can do it.\n\n    Assume that the sizes $n$ and $m$ are very large (say, $10^9$), and the number $k$ is small (around $100$).\n\n    For now, sort the obstacles by their coordinate $x$, and in case of equality \u2014 coordinate $y$.\n\n    Also just learn how to solve a problem without obstacles: i.e. learn how to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another. In one axis, we need to go through $x$ cells, and on the other, $y$ cells. From simple combinatorics, we get a formula using [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):\n\n    $$\\binom{x+y}{x}$$\n\n    Now to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another, avoiding all obstacles, you can use inclusion-exclusion to solve the inverse problem: count the number of ways to walk through the board stepping at a subset of obstacles (and subtract it from the total number of ways).\n\n    When iterating over a subset of the obstacles that we'll step, to count the number of ways to do this simply multiply the number of all paths from starting cell to the first of the selected obstacles, a first obstacle to the second, and so on, and then add or subtract this number from the answer, in accordance with the standard formula of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n    However, this will again be non-polynomial in complexity $O(2^k \\cdot k)$.\n\n    Here goes a polynomial solution:\n\n    We will use dynamic programming. For convenience, push (1,1) to the beginning and (n,m) at the end of the obstacles array. Let's compute the numbers $d[i]$ \u2014 the number of ways to get from the starting point ($0-th$) to $i-th$, without stepping on any other obstacle (except for $i$, of course). We will compute this number for all the obstacle cells, and also for the ending one.\n\n    Let's forget for a second the obstacles and just count the number of paths from cell $0$ to $i$. We need to consider some \"bad\" paths, the ones that pass through the obstacles, and subtract them from the total number of ways of going from $0$ to $i$.\n\n    When considering an obstacle $t$ between $0$ and $i$ ($0 < t < i$), on which we can step, we see that the number of paths from $0$ to $i$ that pass through $t$ which have $t$ as the **first obstacle between start and $i$**. We can compute that as: $d[t]$ multiplied by the number of arbitrary paths from $t$ to $i$. We can count the number of \"bad\" ways summing this for all $t$ between $0$ and $i$.\n\n    We can compute $d[i]$ in $O(k)$ for $O(k)$ obstacles, so this solution has complexity $O(k^2)$.\n\n    ### The number of coprime quadruples\n\n    You're given $n$ numbers: $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. You are required to count the number of ways to choose four numbers so that their combined greatest common divisor is equal to one.\n\n    We will solve the inverse problem \u2014 compute the number of \"bad\" quadruples, i.e. quadruples in which all numbers are divisible by a number $d > 1$.\n\n    We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle while summing over all possible groups of four numbers divisible by a divisor $d$.\n\n    $$ans = \\sum_{d \\ge 2} (-1)^{deg(d)-1} \\cdot f(d)$$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

We will iterate over all possible starting numbers from 1 to `m` and sum up the number of valid sequences for each starting number. The recursive function will check if the current sequence length is `n`, in which case it returns 1 (a valid sequence is found). Otherwise, it will recursively try to extend the sequence by choosing the next number that is at least twice the current number and less than or equal to `m`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a recursive function count_sequences(current, length):\n       If length is equal to n:\n           Return 1 (valid sequence found)\n       Initialize total_sequences to 0\n       For each next_number from current * 2 to m:\n           Add count_sequences(next_number, length + 1) to total_sequences\n       Return total_sequences\n\n   Initialize total_sequences to 0\n   For each starting_number from 1 to m:\n       Add count_sequences(starting_number, 1) to total_sequences\n\n   Return total_sequences\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_sequences(current, length, m, n, memo):\n    # If the sequence has reached the desired length, it's a valid sequence\n    if length == n:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Check if the result is already computed and stored in memo\n    if (current, length) in memo:\n        return memo[(current, length)]\n    \n    total_sequences = 0\n    # Try to extend the sequence with the next number\n    for next_number in range(current * 2, m + 1):\n        total_sequences += count_sequences(next_number, length + 1, m, n, memo)\n    \n    # Store the result in memo to avoid recomputation\n    memo[(current, length)] = total_sequences\n    return total_sequences\n\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    total_sequences = 0\n    memo = {}\n    # Try each starting number from 1 to m\n    for starting_number in range(1, m + 1):\n        total_sequences += count_sequences(starting_number, 1, m, n, memo)\n    \n    return total_sequences\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive function with memoization to efficiently calculate the number of valid sequences.
