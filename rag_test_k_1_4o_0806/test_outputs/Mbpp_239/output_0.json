    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the number of sequences of length `n` where each element in the sequence is a positive integer. The first element can be any positive integer up to `m`. Each subsequent element must be at least twice the previous element and also less than or equal to `m`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization. We will define a recursive function that, given a starting number, calculates the number of valid sequences of a certain length starting from that number. We will iterate over all possible starting numbers from 1 to `m` and sum up the number of valid sequences for each starting number. The recursive function will check if the current sequence length is `n`, in which case it returns 1 (a valid sequence is found). Otherwise, it will recursively try to extend the sequence by choosing the next number that is at least twice the current number and less than or equal to `m`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a recursive function count_sequences(current, length):\n       If length is equal to n:\n           Return 1 (valid sequence found)\n       Initialize total_sequences to 0\n       For each next_number from current * 2 to m:\n           Add count_sequences(next_number, length + 1) to total_sequences\n       Return total_sequences\n\n   Initialize total_sequences to 0\n   For each starting_number from 1 to m:\n       Add count_sequences(starting_number, 1) to total_sequences\n\n   Return total_sequences\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_sequences(current, length, m, n, memo):\n    # If the sequence has reached the desired length, it's a valid sequence\n    if length == n:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Check if the result is already computed and stored in memo\n    if (current, length) in memo:\n        return memo[(current, length)]\n    \n    total_sequences = 0\n    # Try to extend the sequence with the next number\n    for next_number in range(current * 2, m + 1):\n        total_sequences += count_sequences(next_number, length + 1, m, n, memo)\n    \n    # Store the result in memo to avoid recomputation\n    memo[(current, length)] = total_sequences\n    return total_sequences\n\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    total_sequences = 0\n    memo = {}\n    # Try each starting number from 1 to m\n    for starting_number in range(1, m + 1):\n        total_sequences += count_sequences(starting_number, 1, m, n, memo)\n    \n    return total_sequences\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive function with memoization to efficiently calculate the number of valid sequences. The memoization helps to avoid redundant calculations by storing already computed results for specific states.",
