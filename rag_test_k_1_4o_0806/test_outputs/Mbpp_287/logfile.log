INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/287 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Even Numbers**: The even natural numbers start from 2 and increase by 2 for each subsequent even number. So, the first `n` even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.
   
2. **Square Each Even Number**: For each of these even numbers, calculate its square.

3. **Sum the Squares**: Add up all the squared values to get the final result.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a variable `sum_of_squares` to 0 to keep track of the sum.
2. Loop over a range from 1 to `n` (inclusive):
   - For each `i` in this range, calculate the `i`-th even number as `2 * i`.
   - Square this even number.
   - Add the squared value to `sum_of_squares`.
3. Return `sum_of_squares`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def square_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum of squares to 0
    sum_of_squares = 0
    
    # Loop over the first n even numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the i-th even number
        even_number = 2 * i
        # Add the square of the even number to the sum
        sum_of_squares += even_number ** 2
    
    # Return the total sum of squares
    return sum_of_squares
```
