INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/568 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function named `empty_list` that takes an integer `N` as input and returns a list containing `N` empty dictionaries.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To solve this problem, we will create a list that contains `N` empty dictionaries. An empty dictionary in Python is represented by `{}`. We can use a list comprehension to generate a list of `N` such empty dictionaries.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `empty_list` that takes an integer `N` as an argument.
   - Use a list comprehension to create a list with `N` empty dictionaries.
   - Return the list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def empty_list(N: int) -> list:
    # Create a list with N empty dictionaries using list comprehension
    return [{} for _ in range(N)]
```

This function will generate a list of `N` empty dictionaries by iterating `N` times and appending an empty dictionary `{}` to the list in each iteration. The use of `_` in the list comprehension indicates that the loop variable is not used in the body of the loop.

    Title: Placing Bishops on a Chessboard
    Part: 1/1
    # Placing Bishops on a Chessboard

    Find the number of ways to place $K$ bishops on an $N \times N$ chessboard so that no two bishops attack each other.

    ## Algorithm

    This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.

    Let's enumerate the diagonals of the chessboard as follows: black diagonals have odd indices, white diagonals have even indices, and the diagonals are numbered in non-decreasing order of the number of squares in them. Here is an example for a $5 \times 5$ chessboard.

    $$\begin{matrix}
    \bf{1} & 2 & \bf{5} & 6 & \bf{9} \\\
    2 & \bf{5} & 6 & \bf{9} & 8 \\\
    \bf{5} & 6 & \bf{9} & 8 & \bf{7} \\\
    6 & \bf{9} & 8 & \bf{7} & 4 \\\
    \bf{9} & 8 & \bf{7} & 4 & \bf{3} \\\
    \end{matrix}$$

    Let `D[i][j]` denote the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonals with indices up to `i` which have the same color as diagonal `i`.
    Then `i = 1...2N-1` and `j = 0...K`.

    We can calculate `D[i][j]` using only values of `D[i-2]` (we subtract 2 because we only consider diagonals of the same color as $i$).
    There are two ways to get `D[i][j]`.
    Either we place all `j` bishops on previous diagonals: then there are `D[i-2][j]` ways to achieve this.
    Or we place one bishop on diagonal `i` and `j-1` bishops on previous diagonals.
    The number of ways to do this equals the number of squares in diagonal `i` minus `j-1`, because each of `j-1` bishops placed on previous diagonals will block one square on the current diagonal.
    The number of squares in diagonal `i` can be calculated as follows:

    ```cpp
    int squares (int i) {
        if (i & 1)
            return i / 4 * 2 + 1;
        else
            return (i - 1) / 4 * 2 + 2;
    }
    ```

    The base case is simple: `D[i][0] = 1`, `D[1][1] = 1`.

    Once we have calculated all values of `D[i][j]`, the answer can be obtained as follows:
    consider all possible numbers of bishops placed on black diagonals `i=0...K`, with corresponding numbers of bishops on white diagonals `K-i`.
    The bishops placed on black and white diagonals never attack each other, so the placements can be done independently.
    The index of the last black diagonal is `2N-1`, the last white one is `2N-2`.
    For each `i` we add `D[2N-1][i] * D[2N-2][K-i]` to the answer.

    ## Implementation

    ```cpp
    int bishop_placements(int N, int K)
    {
        if (K > 2 * N - 1)
            return 0;

        vector<vector<int>> D(N * 2, vector<int>(K + 1));
        for (int i = 0; i < N * 2; ++i)
            D[i][0] = 1;
        D[1][1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i < N * 2; ++i)
            for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j)
                D[i][j] = D[i-2][j] + D[i-2][j-1] * (squares(i) - j + 1);

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i)
            ans += D[N*2-1][i] * D[N*2-2][K-i];
        return ans;
    }
    ```

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function named empty_list that takes an integer N as input.
   Create a list using a list comprehension:
