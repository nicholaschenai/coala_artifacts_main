Here is an example for a $5 \\times 5$ chessboard.\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix}\n    \\bf{1} & 2 & \\bf{5} & 6 & \\bf{9} \\\\\\\n    2 & \\bf{5} & 6 & \\bf{9} & 8 \\\\\\\n    \\bf{5} & 6 & \\bf{9} & 8 & \\bf{7} \\\\\\\n    6 & \\bf{9} & 8 & \\bf{7} & 4 \\\\\\\n    \\bf{9} & 8 & \\bf{7} & 4 & \\bf{3} \\\\\\\n    \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    Let `D[i][j]` denote the number of ways to place `j` bishops on diagonals with indices up to `i` which have the same color as diagonal `i`.\n    Then `i = 1...2N-1` and `j = 0...K`.\n\n    We can calculate `D[i][j]` using only values of `D[i-2]` (we subtract 2 because we only consider diagonals of the same color as $i$).\n    There are two ways to get `D[i][j]`.\n    Either we place all `j` bishops on previous diagonals: then there are `D[i-2][j]` ways to achieve this.\n    Or we place one bishop on diagonal `i` and `j-1` bishops on previous diagonals.\n    The number of ways to do this equals the number of squares in diagonal `i` minus `j-1`, because each of `j-1` bishops placed on previous diagonals will block one square on the current diagonal.\n    The number of squares in diagonal `i` can be calculated as follows:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int squares (int i) {\n        if (i & 1)\n            return i / 4 * 2 + 1;\n        else\n            return (i - 1) / 4 * 2 + 2;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The base case is simple: `D[i][0] = 1`, `D[1][1] = 1`.\n\n    Once we have calculated all values of `D[i][j]`, the answer can be obtained as follows:\n    consider all possible numbers of bishops placed on black diagonals `i=0...K`, with corresponding numbers of bishops on white diagonals `K-i`.\n    The bishops placed on black and white diagonals never attack each other, so the placements can be done independently.\n    The index of the last black diagonal is `2N-1`, the last white one is `2N-2`.\n    For each `i` we add `D[2N-1][i] * D[2N-2][K-i]` to the answer.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n    int bishop_placements(int N, int K)\n    {\n        if (K > 2 * N - 1)\n            return 0;\n\n        vector<vector<int>> D(N * 2, vector<int>(K + 1));\n        for (int i = 0; i < N * 2; ++i)\n            D[i][0] = 1;\n        D[1][1] = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i < N * 2; ++i)\n            for (int j = 1; j <= K; ++j)\n                D[i][j] = D[i-2][j] + D[i-2][j-1] * (squares(i) - j + 1);\n\n        int ans = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i)\n            ans += D[N*2-1][i] * D[N*2-2][K-i];\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
