    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes an array and an integer `k` as inputs. The function should reverse the elements of the array from the start up to the `k`-th position (inclusive) and leave the rest of the array unchanged.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, identify the subarray that needs to be reversed. This subarray includes elements from the start of the array up to the `k`-th position.\n   - Reverse this subarray.\n   - Concatenate the reversed subarray with the remaining part of the array that starts from the `k+1`-th position.\n   - Return the new array.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):\n       if k is less than or equal to 0:\n           return arr (no change needed)\n       if k is greater than the length of arr:\n           set k to the length of arr\n       reverse the subarray from index 0 to k-1\n       concatenate the reversed subarray with the rest of the array from index k\n       return the concatenated array\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):\n    # If k is less than or equal to 0, no reversal is needed\n    if k <= 0:\n        return arr\n    \n    # If k is greater than the length of the array, adjust k to the length of the array\n    if k > len(arr):\n        k = len(arr)\n    \n    # Reverse the subarray from the start to the k-th position (exclusive)\n    reversed_part = arr[:k][::-1]\n    \n    # Concatenate the reversed part with the rest of the array\n    result = reversed_part + arr[k:]\n    \n    # Return the resulting array\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution handles edge cases where `k` is less than or equal to zero or greater than the length of the array, ensuring the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.",
