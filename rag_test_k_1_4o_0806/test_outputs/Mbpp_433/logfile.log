INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/433 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if a given number is greater than all the elements in a provided list. If the number is greater than every element in the list, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate through each element in the list.
2. Compare the given number with each element.
3. If the number is found to be less than or equal to any element in the list, return `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any element greater than or equal to the number, return `True`.

### Pseudocode

```
function check_greater(arr, num):
    for each element in arr:
        if num is less than or equal to element:
            return False
    return True
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def check_greater(arr, num):
    # Iterate through each element in the array
    for element in arr:
        # If the number is less than or equal to the current element
        if num <= element:
            # Return False as the number is not greater than this element
            return False
    # If the loop completes, the number is greater than all elements
    return True
```

    ### Binary search on the answer

    Such situation often occurs when we're asked to compute some value, but we're only capable of checking whether this value is at least $i$. For example, you're given an array $a_1,\dots,a_n$ and you're asked to find the maximum floored average sum

    $$
    \left \lfloor \frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \right\rfloor
    $$

    among all possible pairs of $l,r$ such that $r-l \geq x$. One of simple ways to solve this problem is to check whether the answer is at least $\lambda$, that is if there is a pair $l, r$ such that the following is true:

    $$
    \frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \geq \lambda.
    $$

    Equivalently, it rewrites as

    $$
    (a_l - \lambda) + (a_{l+1} - \lambda) + \dots + (a_r - \lambda) \geq 0,
    $$

    so now we need to check whether there is a subarray of a new array $a_i - \lambda$ of length at least $x+1$ with non-negative sum, which is doable with some prefix sums.

    ## Continuous search

    Let $f : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be a real-valued function that is continuous on a segment $[L, R]$.

    Without loss of generality assume that $f(L) \leq f(R)$. From [intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem) it follows that for any $y \in [f(L), f(R)]$ there is $x \in [L, R]$ such that $f(x) = y$. Note that, unlike previous paragraphs, the function is _not_ required to be monotonous.

    The value $x$ could be approximated up to $\pm\delta$ in $O\left(\log \frac{R-L}{\delta}\right)$ time for any specific value of $\delta$. The idea is essentially the same, if we take $M \in (L, R)$ then we would be able to reduce the search interval to either $[L, M]$ or $[M, R]$ depending on whether $f(M)$ is larger than $y$. One common example here would be finding roots of odd-degree polynomials.

    For example, let $f(x)=x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. Then $f(L) \to -\infty$ and $f(R) \to +\infty$ with $L \to -\infty$ and $R \to +\infty$. Which means that it is always possible to find sufficiently small $L$ and sufficiently large $R$ such that $f(L) < 0$ and $f(R) > 0$. Then, it is possible to find with binary search arbitrarily small interval containing $x$ such that $f(x)=0$.

    ## Search with powers of 2

    Another noteworthy way to do binary search is, instead of maintaining an active segment, to maintain the current pointer $i$ and the current power $k$. The pointer starts at $i=L$ and then on each iteration one tests the predicate at point $i+2^k$. If the predicate is still $0$, the pointer is advanced from $i$ to $i+2^k$, otherwise it stays the same, then the power $k$ is decreased by $1$.

    This paradigm is widely used in tasks around trees, such as finding lowest common ancestor of two vertices or finding an ancestor of a specific vertex that has a certain height. It could also be adapted to e.g. find the $k$-th non-zero element in a Fenwick tree.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/433 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given number is greater than all the elements in a provided list (array). The function should return `True` if the number is greater than every element in the list, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each element in the list and compare it with the given number. If we find any element in the list that is greater than or equal to the given number, we will return `False` immediately. If we finish checking all elements and none are greater than or equal to the given number, we will return `True`.

   ```
   function check_greater(array, number):
