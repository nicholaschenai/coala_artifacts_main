For example, you're given an array $a_1,\\dots,a_n$ and you're asked to find the maximum floored average sum\n\n    $$\n    \\left \\lfloor \\frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \\right\\rfloor\n    $$\n\n    among all possible pairs of $l,r$ such that $r-l \\geq x$. One of simple ways to solve this problem is to check whether the answer is at least $\\lambda$, that is if there is a pair $l, r$ such that the following is true:\n\n    $$\n    \\frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \\geq \\lambda.\n    $$\n\n    Equivalently, it rewrites as\n\n    $$\n    (a_l - \\lambda) + (a_{l+1} - \\lambda) + \\dots + (a_r - \\lambda) \\geq 0,\n    $$\n\n    so now we need to check whether there is a subarray of a new array $a_i - \\lambda$ of length at least $x+1$ with non-negative sum, which is doable with some prefix sums.\n\n    ## Continuous search\n\n    Let $f : \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R$ be a real-valued function that is continuous on a segment $[L, R]$.\n\n    Without loss of generality assume that $f(L) \\leq f(R)$. From [intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem) it follows that for any $y \\in [f(L), f(R)]$ there is $x \\in [L, R]$ such that $f(x) = y$. Note that, unlike previous paragraphs, the function is _not_ required to be monotonous.\n\n    The value $x$ could be approximated up to $\\pm\\delta$ in $O\\left(\\log \\frac{R-L}{\\delta}\\right)$ time for any specific value of $\\delta$. The idea is essentially the same, if we take $M \\in (L, R)$ then we would be able to reduce the search interval to either $[L, M]$ or $[M, R]$ depending on whether $f(M)$ is larger than $y$. One common example here would be finding roots of odd-degree polynomials.\n\n    For example, let $f(x)=x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. Then $f(L) \\to -\\infty$ and $f(R) \\to +\\infty$ with $L \\to -\\infty$ and $R \\to +\\infty$. Which means that it is always possible to find sufficiently small $L$ and sufficiently large $R$ such that $f(L) < 0$ and $f(R) > 0$. Then, it is possible to find with binary search arbitrarily small interval containing $x$ such that $f(x)=0$.\n\n    ## Search with powers of 2\n\n    Another noteworthy way to do binary search is, instead of maintaining an active segment, to maintain the current pointer $i$ and the current power $k$. The pointer starts at $i=L$ and then on each iteration one tests the predicate at point $i+2^k$. If the predicate is still $0$, the pointer is advanced from $i$ to $i+2^k$, otherwise it stays the same, then the power $k$ is decreased by $1$.\n\n    This paradigm is widely used in tasks around trees, such as finding lowest common ancestor of two vertices or finding an ancestor of a specific vertex that has a certain height. It could also be adapted to e.g. find the $k$-th non-zero element in a Fenwick tree.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
