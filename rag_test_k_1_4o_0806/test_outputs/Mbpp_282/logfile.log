INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/282 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers as input and returns a new list. This new list should contain the result of subtracting each element of the second list from the corresponding element of the first list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, ensure that both input lists are of the same length, as element-wise operations require this.
   - Create an empty list to store the results.
   - Iterate over the indices of the lists.
   - For each index, subtract the element in the second list from the element in the first list and append the result to the results list.
   - Return the results list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `sub_list` that takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`.
   - Initialize an empty list called `result`.
   - Loop over the range of the length of `list1` (or `list2` since they are the same length).
     - For each index `i`, calculate the difference between `list1[i]` and `list2[i]`.
     - Append this difference to `result`.
   - Return the `result` list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sub_list(list1, list2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the subtraction
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Subtract the element in list2 from the element in list1 at the same index
        difference = list1[i] - list2[i]
        # Append the result to the result list
        result.append(difference)
    
    # Return the list containing the element-wise differences
    return result
```

This function will correctly subtract the elements of the second list from the first list, element by element, and return the resulting list.

        Given $N$, $M$, $A$ and $B$, compute $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{N-1} \lfloor \frac{A \cdot i + B}{M} \rfloor$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

                    if diff(dq, dp) > 0:
                        k = min(k, (B - diff(qh[-1], ph[-1])) // diff(dq, dp))

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m 
            def mod_min(r, n, m):
                a = fraction(r, m)
                p, q = convergents(a)
                for i in range(2, len(q)):
                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):
                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]
                        return q[i-1] + t*q[i]
