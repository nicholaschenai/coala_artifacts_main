INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/74 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function `is_samepatterns` that checks if two lists follow the same pattern. Specifically, the function should return `True` if the sequence of elements in the first list can be mapped to the sequence of elements in the second list in a one-to-one manner, and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Mapping Concept**: We need to establish a one-to-one mapping between elements of the first list and elements of the second list. This means each unique element in the first list should correspond to a unique element in the second list and vice versa.

2. **Iterate and Map**: As we iterate through both lists simultaneously, we will maintain two dictionaries:
   - `pattern_to_value`: Maps elements from the second list to elements in the first list.
   - `value_to_pattern`: Maps elements from the first list to elements in the second list.

3. **Check Consistency**: For each pair of elements from the two lists:
   - If the element from the second list is already in `pattern_to_value`, check if it maps to the current element from the first list.
   - If the element from the first list is already in `value_to_pattern`, check if it maps to the current element from the second list.
   - If any of these checks fail, return `False`.

4. **Return True**: If we can iterate through both lists without any mapping inconsistencies, return `True`.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_samepatterns(values, patterns):
    if length of values is not equal to length of patterns:
        return False
    
    initialize pattern_to_value as an empty dictionary
    initialize value_to_pattern as an empty dictionary
    
    for each pair (value, pattern) in zip(values, patterns):
        if pattern in pattern_to_value:
            if pattern_to_value[pattern] is not equal to value:
                return False
        else:
            pattern_to_value[pattern] = value
        
        if value in value_to_pattern:
            if value_to_pattern[value] is not equal to pattern:
                return False
        else:
            value_to_pattern[value] = pattern
    
    return True
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_samepatterns(values, patterns):
    # If the lengths of the lists are not equal, they cannot follow the same pattern
    if len(values) != len(patterns):
        return False
    
    # Dictionaries to store the mapping from patterns to values and vice versa
    pattern_to_value = {}
    value_to_pattern = {}
    
    # Iterate over both lists simultaneously
    for value, pattern in zip(values, patterns):
        # Check if the pattern is already mapped to a value
        if pattern in pattern_to_value:
            # If the current value does not match the mapped value, return False
            if pattern_to_value[pattern] != value:
                return False
        else:
            # Map the pattern to the current value
            pattern_to_value[pattern] = value
        
        # Check if the value is already mapped to a pattern
        if value in value_to_pattern:
            # If the current pattern does not match the mapped pattern, return False
            if value_to_pattern[value] != pattern:
                return False
        else:
            # Map the value to the current pattern
            value_to_pattern[value] = pattern
    
    # If all checks pass, the lists follow the same pattern
    return True

    Chapter: Data structures
    Section: Comparison to sorting
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Comparison to sorting}

    It is often possible to solve a problem
    using either data structures or sorting.
    Sometimes there are remarkable differences
    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,
    which may be hidden in their time complexities.

    Let us consider a problem where
    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$
    that both contain $n$ elements.
    Our task is to calculate the number of elements
    that belong to both of the lists.
    For example, for the lists
    \[A = [5,2,8,9] \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\]
    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5
    and 9 belong to both of the lists.

    A straightforward solution to the problem is
    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,
    but next we will focus on
    more efficient algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,
    and after this, we iterate through the elements
    of $B$ and check for each elements if it
    also belongs to $A$.
    This is efficient because the elements of $A$
    are in a set.
    Using the \texttt{set} structure,
    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,
    so instead of the \texttt{set} structure
    we can also use the \texttt{unordered\_set} structure.
    This is an easy way to make the algorithm
    more efficient, because we only have to change
    the underlying data structure.
    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.
    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.
    After this, we iterate through both the lists
    at the same time and find the common elements.
    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n)$,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    so the total time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    The following table shows how efficient
    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and
    the elements of the lists are random
    integers between $1 \ldots 10^9$:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\
    $2 \cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\
    $3 \cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\
    $4 \cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\
    $5 \cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that
    they use different set structures.
    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on
    the running time, because Algorithm 2
    is 4–5 times faster than Algorithm 1.

    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3
    which uses sorting.
    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.
    Interestingly, the time complexity of both
    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \log n)$,
    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.
    This can be explained by the fact that
    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done
    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.
    On the other hand,
    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree
    during the whole algorithm.

   We need to write a function that checks if two lists follow the same pattern. Specifically, for each unique element in the first list, there should be a corresponding unique element in the second list, and the sequence of these elements should match.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a mapping approach. We will create two dictionaries: one to map elements from the first list to the second list and another to map elements from the second list to the first list. As we iterate through both lists simultaneously, we will check if the current element in the first list has already been mapped to a different element in the second list, or vice versa. If any inconsistency is found, the lists do not follow the same pattern. If we can iterate through both lists without finding any inconsistencies, then the lists follow the same pattern.
