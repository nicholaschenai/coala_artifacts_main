    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the common tuples between two lists of tuples, where the order of elements in the tuples does not matter. The result should be a set of tuples that are present in both lists, considering tuples with the same elements but in different orders as identical.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Convert each tuple in both lists to a sorted tuple. This ensures that tuples with the same elements but in different orders are treated as identical.\n   - Convert the lists of sorted tuples into sets to eliminate duplicates and allow for easy intersection.\n   - Find the intersection of these two sets to get the common tuples.\n   - Return the intersection as a set of tuples.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function tuple_intersection(list1, list2):\n       Convert each tuple in list1 to a sorted tuple and store in set1\n       Convert each tuple in list2 to a sorted tuple and store in set2\n       Find the intersection of set1 and set2\n       Return the intersection\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef tuple_intersection(list1, list2):\n    # Convert each tuple in list1 to a sorted tuple and store in set1\n    set1 = {tuple(sorted(t)) for t in list1}\n    \n    # Convert each tuple in list2 to a sorted tuple and store in set2\n    set2 = {tuple(sorted(t)) for t in list2}\n    \n    # Find the intersection of set1 and set2\n    intersection = set1.intersection(set2)\n    \n    # Return the intersection\n    return intersection\n```",
