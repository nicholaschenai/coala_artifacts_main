    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists (nested lists) as input and returns a list of elements that are common to all the nested lists. The function should find the intersection of all the lists provided.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start by assuming the first list contains all the common elements.\n   - Iterate through each subsequent list and update the common elements by finding the intersection with the current list.\n   - Continue this process until all lists have been processed.\n   - The remaining elements in the common set are the elements that are present in all lists.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n       if nested_lists is empty:\n           return an empty list\n       \n       initialize common_elements with the first list converted to a set\n       \n       for each list in nested_lists starting from the second list:\n           update common_elements to be the intersection of common_elements and the current list converted to a set\n       \n       return the list of common_elements\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list\n    if not nested_lists:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize the common elements with the first list converted to a set\n    common_elements = set(nested_lists[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each list starting from the second one\n    for lst in nested_lists[1:]:\n        # Update the common elements by intersecting with the current list converted to a set\n        common_elements.intersection_update(lst)\n    \n    # Return the common elements as a list\n    return list(common_elements)\n```",
