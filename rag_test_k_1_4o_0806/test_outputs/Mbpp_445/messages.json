        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that takes two tuples of tuples as input. Each inner tuple contains two integers. The function should perform element-wise multiplication of the integers in the corresponding positions of the inner tuples from both input tuples. The result should be a new tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the products of the corresponding elements.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate over the pairs of inner tuples from the two input tuples.\n2. For each pair of inner tuples, we will multiply the first elements together and the second elements together.\n3. We will store the results of these multiplications in a new tuple.\n4. Finally, we will return a tuple containing all the result tuples.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define the function `index_multiplication` that takes two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`.\n2. Initialize an empty list `result`.\n3. Loop over the pairs of inner tuples from `tuple1` and `tuple2` using `zip`.\n   - For each pair `(a, b)` from `tuple1` and `(c, d)` from `tuple2`:\n     - Calculate the product of the first elements: `product1 = a * c`.\n     - Calculate the product of the second elements: `product2 = b * d`.\n     - Append the tuple `(product1, product2)` to `result`.\n4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple and return it.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef index_multiplication(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result tuples\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over pairs of inner tuples from tuple1 and tuple2\n    for (a, b), (c, d) in zip(tuple1, tuple2):\n        # Calculate the products of corresponding elements\n        product1 = a * c\n        product2 = b * d\n        # Append the result tuple to the result list\n        result.append((product1, product2))\n    \n    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```"
