    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes two tuples of tuples as input. Each inner tuple contains two integers. The function should perform element-wise multiplication of the corresponding elements in the tuples and return a new tuple of tuples with the results.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, ensure that both input tuples have the same length and that each inner tuple contains exactly two elements.\n   - Iterate over the pairs of tuples from the two input tuples.\n   - For each pair of tuples, multiply the corresponding elements.\n   - Store the result of each multiplication in a new tuple.\n   - Collect all the resulting tuples into a final tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each pair of tuples (t1, t2) from tuple1 and tuple2:\n           Multiply the first elements of t1 and t2\n           Multiply the second elements of t1 and t2\n           Create a new tuple with the results of the multiplications\n           Append the new tuple to the result list\n       Convert the result list to a tuple\n       Return the result tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result tuples\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over pairs of tuples from tuple1 and tuple2\n    for t1, t2 in zip(tuple1, tuple2):\n        # Multiply the first elements of the tuples\n        first_product = t1[0] * t2[0]\n        # Multiply the second elements of the tuples\n        second_product = t1[1] * t2[1]\n        # Create a new tuple with the products\n        result_tuple = (first_product, second_product)\n        # Append the new tuple to the result list\n        result.append(result_tuple)\n    \n    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```",
