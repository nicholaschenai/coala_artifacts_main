INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/445 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes two tuples of tuples as input. Each inner tuple contains two integers. The function should perform element-wise multiplication of the integers in the corresponding positions of the inner tuples from both input tuples. The result should be a new tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the products of the corresponding elements.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate over the pairs of inner tuples from the two input tuples.
2. For each pair of inner tuples, we will multiply the first elements together and the second elements together.
3. We will store the results of these multiplications in a new tuple.
4. Finally, we will return a tuple containing all the result tuples.

## Pseudocode

1. Define the function `index_multiplication` that takes two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
2. Initialize an empty list `result`.
3. Loop over the pairs of inner tuples from `tuple1` and `tuple2` using `zip`.
   - For each pair `(a, b)` from `tuple1` and `(c, d)` from `tuple2`:
     - Calculate the product of the first elements: `product1 = a * c`.
     - Calculate the product of the second elements: `product2 = b * d`.
     - Append the tuple `(product1, product2)` to `result`.
4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple and return it.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def index_multiplication(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result tuples
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over pairs of inner tuples from tuple1 and tuple2
    for (a, b), (c, d) in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        # Calculate the products of corresponding elements
        product1 = a * c
        product2 = b * d
        # Append the result tuple to the result list
        result.append((product1, product2))
    
    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
```

    \chapter{Matrices}

    \index{matrix}

    A \key{matrix} is a mathematical concept
    that corresponds to a two-dimensional array
    in programming. For example,
    \[
    A = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 13 & 7 & 4 \\
      7 & 0 & 8 & 2 \\
      9 & 5 & 4 & 18 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]
    is a matrix of size $3 \times 4$, i.e.,
    it has 3 rows and 4 columns.
    The notation $[i,j]$ refers to
    the element in row $i$ and column $j$
    in a matrix.
    For example, in the above matrix,
    $A[2,3]=8$ and $A[3,1]=9$.

    \index{vector}

    A special case of a matrix is a \key{vector}
    that is a one-dimensional matrix of size $n \times 1$.
    For example,
    \[
    V =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    4 \\
    7 \\
    5 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
    is a vector that contains three elements.

    \index{transpose}

    The \key{transpose} $A^T$ of a matrix $A$
    is obtained when the rows and columns of $A$
    are swapped, i.e., $A^T[i,j]=A[j,i]$:
    \[
    A^T = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 7 & 9 \\
      13 & 0 & 5 \\
      7 & 8 & 4 \\
      4 & 2 & 18 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]

    \index{square matrix}

    A matrix is a \key{square matrix} if it
    has the same number of rows and columns.
    For example, the following matrix is a
    square matrix:

    \[
    S = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
      3 & 12 & 4  \\
      5 & 9 & 15  \\
      0 & 2 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]

    \section{Operations}

    The sum $A+B$ of matrices $A$ and $B$
    is defined if the matrices are of the same size.
    The result is a matrix where each element
    is the sum of the corresponding elements
    in $A$ and $B$.

    For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 & 2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    +
     \begin{bmatrix}
      4 & 9 & 3 \\
      8 & 1 & 3 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6+4 & 1+9 & 4+3 \\
      3+8 & 9+1 & 2+3 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      10 & 10 & 7 \\
      11 & 10 & 5 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    Multiplying a matrix $A$ by a value $x$ means
    that each element of $A$ is multiplied by $x$.
    For example,
    \[
     2 \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 & 2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 \cdot 6 & 2\cdot1 & 2\cdot4 \\
      2\cdot3 & 2\cdot9 & 2\cdot2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      12 & 2 & 8 \\
      6 & 18 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    \subsubsection{Matrix multiplication}

    \index{matrix multiplication}

    The product $AB$ of matrices $A$ and $B$
    is defined if $A$ is of size $a \times n$
    and $B$ is of size $n \times b$, i.e.,
    the width of $A$ equals the height of $B$.
    The result is a matrix of size $a \times b$
    whose elements are calculated using the formula
    \[
    AB[i,j] = \sum_{k=1}^n A[i,k] \cdot B[k,j].
    \]

    The idea is that each element of $AB$
    is a sum of products of elements of $A$ and $B$
    according to the following picture:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,3);
    \draw (5,0) grid (10,3);
    \draw (5,4) grid (10,8);

    \node at (2,-1) {$A$};
    \node at (7.5,-1) {$AB$};
    \node at (11,6) {$B$};

    \draw[thick,->,red,line width=2pt] (0,1.5) -- (4,1.5);
    \draw[thick,->,red,line width=2pt] (6.5,8) -- (6.5,4);
    \draw[thick,red,line width=2pt] (6.5,1.5) circle (0.4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    For example,

    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 6 \\
      2 & 9 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 2 & 1 \cdot 6 + 4 \cdot 9 \\
      3 \cdot 1 + 9 \cdot 2 & 3 \cdot 6 + 9 \cdot 9 \\
      8 \cdot 1 + 6 \cdot 2 & 8 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 9 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      9 & 42 \\
      21 & 99 \\
      20 & 102 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    Matrix multiplication is associative,
    so $A(BC)=(AB)C$ holds,
    but it is not commutative,
    so $AB = BA$ does not usually hold.

    \index{identity matrix}

    An \key{identity matrix} is a square matrix
    where each element on the diagonal is 1
    and all other elements are 0.
    For example, the following matrix
    is the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix:
    \[
     I = \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]

    \begin{samepage}
    Multiplying a matrix by an identity matrix
    does not change it. For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix} \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px}
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]
    \end{samepage}

    Using a straightforward algorithm,
    we can calculate the product of
    two $n \times n$ matrices
    in $O(n^3)$ time.
    There are also more efficient algorithms
    for matrix multiplication\footnote{The first such
    algorithm was Strassen's algorithm,
    published in 1969 \cite{str69},
    whose time complexity is $O(n^{2.80735})$;
    the best current algorithm \cite{gal14}
    works in $O(n^{2.37286})$ time.},
    but they are mostly of theoretical interest
    and such algorithms are not necessary
    in competitive programming.


    \subsubsection{Matrix power}

    \index{matrix power}

    The power $A^k$ of a matrix $A$ is defined
    if $A$ is a square matrix.
    The definition is based on matrix multiplication:
    \[ A^k = \underbrace{A \cdot A \cdot A \cdots A}_{\textrm{$k$ times}} \]
    For example,

    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^3 =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix} \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix} \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix} =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      48 & 165 \\
      33 & 114 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]
    In addition, $A^0$ is an identity matrix. For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^0 =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    The matrix $A^k$ can be efficiently calculated
    in $O(n^3 \log k)$ time using the
    algorithm in Chapter 21.2. For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^8 =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^4 \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^4.
    \]

    \subsubsection{Determinant}

    \index{determinant}

    The \key{determinant} $\det(A)$ of a matrix $A$
    is defined if $A$ is a square matrix.
    If $A$ is of size $1 \times 1$,
    then $\det(A)=A[1,1]$.
    The determinant of a larger matrix is
    calculated recursively using the formula \index{cofactor}
    \[\det(A)=\sum_{j=1}^n A[1,j] C[1,j],\]
    where $C[i,j]$ is the \key{cofactor} of $A$
    at $[i,j]$.
    The cofactor is calculated using the formula
    \[C[i,j] = (-1)^{i+j} \det(M[i,j]),\]
    where $M[i,j]$ is obtained by removing
    row $i$ and column $j$ from $A$.
    Due to the coefficient $(-1)^{i+j}$ in the cofactor,
    every other determinant is positive
    and negative.
    For example,
    \[
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      3 & 4 \\
      1 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    ) = 3 \cdot 6 - 4 \cdot 1 = 14 
    \]
    and
    \[
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 4 & 3 \\
      5 & 1 & 6 \\
      7 & 2 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    ) = 
    2 \cdot
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 6 \\
      2 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    )
    -4 \cdot
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      5 & 6 \\
      7 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    )
    +3 \cdot
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      5 & 1 \\
      7 & 2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    ) = 81.
    \]

    \index{inverse matrix}

    The determinant of $A$ tells us
    whether there is an \key{inverse matrix}
    $A^{-1}$ such that $A \cdot A^{-1} = I$,
    where $I$ is an identity matrix.
    It turns out that $A^{-1}$ exists
    exactly when $\det(A) \neq 0$,
    and it can be calculated using the formula

    \[A^{-1}[i,j] = \frac{C[j,i]}{det(A)}.\]

    For example,

    \[
    \underbrace{
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 4 & 3\\
      5 & 1 & 6\\
      7 & 2 & 4\\
     \end{bmatrix}
    }_{A}
    \cdot
    \underbrace{
     \frac{1}{81}
     \begin{bmatrix}
       -8 & -10 & 21 \\
       22 & -13 & 3 \\
       3 & 24 & -18 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    }_{A^{-1}}
    =
    \underbrace{
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    }_{I}.
    \]

   - For each pair of tuples, multiply the corresponding elements.
   - Store the result of each multiplication in a new tuple.
   - Collect all the resulting tuples into a final tuple and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each pair of tuples (t1, t2) from tuple1 and tuple2:
           Multiply the first elements of t1 and t2
           Multiply the second elements of t1 and t2
           Create a new tuple with the results of the multiplications
           Append the new tuple to the result list
       Convert the result list to a tuple
       Return the result tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result tuples
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over pairs of tuples from tuple1 and tuple2
    for t1, t2 in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        # Multiply the first elements of the tuples
        first_product = t1[0] * t2[0]
        # Multiply the second elements of the tuples
        second_product = t1[1] * t2[1]
        # Create a new tuple with the products
        result_tuple = (first_product, second_product)
        # Append the new tuple to the result list
        result.append(result_tuple)
    
    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
```
