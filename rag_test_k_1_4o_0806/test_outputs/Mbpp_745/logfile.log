INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/745 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that finds all numbers within a specified range (from `startnum` to `endnum`) where each number is divisible by every digit it contains. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 1 and 2, so it should be included in the result.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate through each number in the range from `startnum` to `endnum`.
2. For each number, check if it is divisible by each of its digits.
3. If a number is divisible by all of its digits, add it to the result list.
4. Return the list of numbers that meet the criteria.

## Pseudocode

```
function divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    initialize an empty list called result
    for each number in the range from startnum to endnum (inclusive):
        convert the number to a string to iterate over its digits
        set a flag divisible to True
        for each digit in the string representation of the number:
            convert the digit back to an integer
            if the digit is 0 or the number is not divisible by the digit:
                set divisible to False
                break the loop
        if divisible is True:
            append the number to the result list
    return the result list
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def divisible_by_digits(startnum: int, endnum: int) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the specified range
    for num in range(startnum, endnum + 1):
        # Convert the number to a string to access each digit
        num_str = str(num)
        # Assume the number is divisible by all its digits
        divisible = True
        
        # Check each digit
        for digit_char in num_str:
            digit = int(digit_char)
            # If the digit is 0 or the number is not divisible by the digit
            if digit == 0 or num % digit != 0:
                divisible = False
                break
        
        # If the number is divisible by all its digits, add it to the result
        if divisible:
            result.append(num)
    
    # Return the list of numbers that are divisible by all their digits
    return result
```

    Title: Number of divisors / sum of divisors
    Part: 1/1
    # Number of divisors / sum of divisors

    In this article we discuss how to compute the number of divisors $d(n)$ and the sum of divisors $\sigma(n)$ of a given number $n$.

    ## Number of divisors

    It should be obvious that the prime factorization of a divisor $d$ has to be a subset of the prime factorization of $n$, e.g. $6 = 2 \cdot 3$ is a divisor of $60 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$.
    So we only need to find all different subsets of the prime factorization of $n$.

    Usually the number of subsets is $2^x$ for a set with $x$ elements.
    However this is no longer true, if there are repeated elements in the set. In our case some prime factors may appear multiple times in the prime factorization of $n$.

    If a prime factor $p$ appears $e$ times in the prime factorization of $n$, then we can use the factor $p$ up to $e$ times in the subset.
    Which means we have $e+1$ choices.

    Therefore if the prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers, then the number of divisors is:

    $$d(n) = (e_1 + 1) \cdot (e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)$$

    A way of thinking about it is the following:

    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then there are obviously $e_1 + 1$ divisors ($1, p_1, p_1^2, \dots, p_1^{e_1}$).

    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then you can arrange all divisors in form of a tabular.

    $$\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
    & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\hline
    1 & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    p_1 & p_1 & p_1 \cdot p_2 & p_1 \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1 \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    p_1^2 & p_1^2 & p_1^2 \cdot p_2 & p_1^2 \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1^2 \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\
    p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2 & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    \end{array}$$

    So the number of divisors is trivially $(e_1 + 1) \cdot (e_2 + 1)$.

    * A similar argument can be made if there are more then two distinct prime factors.


    ```cpp
    long long numberOfDivisors(long long num) {
        long long total = 1;
        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                int e = 0;
                do {
                    e++;
                    num /= i;
                } while (num % i == 0);
                total *= e + 1;
            }
        }
        if (num > 1) {
            total *= 2;
        }
        return total;
    }
    ```

    ## Sum of divisors

    We can use the same argument of the previous section.

    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then the sum is:

    $$1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{e_1} = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1}$$

    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then we can make the same table as before.
      The only difference is that now we now want to compute the sum instead of counting the elements.
      It is easy to see, that the sum of each combination can be expressed as:

    $$\left(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{e_1}\right) \cdot \left(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_2^{e_2}\right)$$

    $$ = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \cdot \frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1}$$

    * In general, for $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ we receive the formula:

    $$\sigma(n) = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \cdot \frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1} \cdots \frac{p_k^{e_k + 1} - 1}{p_k - 1}$$

    ```cpp
    long long SumOfDivisors(long long num) {
        long long total = 1;

        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                int e = 0;
                do {
                    e++;
                    num /= i;
                } while (num % i == 0);

                long long sum = 0, pow = 1;
                do {
                    sum += pow;
                    pow *= i;
                } while (e-- > 0);
                total *= sum;
            }
        }
        if (num > 1) {
            total *= (1 + num);
        }
        return total;
    }
    ```

    ## Multiplicative functions

    A multiplicative function is a function $f(x)$ which satisfies

    $$f(a \cdot b) = f(a) \cdot f(b)$$

    if $a$ and $b$ are coprime.

    Both $d(n)$ and $\sigma(n)$ are multiplicative functions.

    Multiplicative functions have a huge variety of interesting properties, which can be very useful in number theory problems.
    For instance the Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is also multiplicative.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/745 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that finds all numbers within a specified range (from `startnum` to `endnum`) where each number is divisible by every digit it contains. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 1 and 2, so it should be included in the result.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Iterate through each number in the given range.
   - For each number, extract its digits.
   - Check if the number is divisible by each of its digits.
   - If the number is divisible by all its digits, add it to the result list.
   - Return the list of such numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
       result = []
       for number in range from startnum to endnum (inclusive):

           for each digit in the number:
               if digit is '0' or number is not divisible by digit:
                   break the loop
           if the loop completes without breaking:
               add number to result
       return result
   ```

    # Iterate through each number in the range
    for number in range(startnum, endnum + 1):

        number_str = str(number)
        # Assume the number is divisible by all its digits
        divisible = True
        # Check each digit
        for digit in number_str:
            # Convert the digit back to an integer
