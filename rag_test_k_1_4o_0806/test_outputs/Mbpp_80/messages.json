A tetrahedral number is a figurate number that represents a pyramid with a triangular base and three sides (a tetrahedron). The nth tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The nth tetrahedral number can be calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     T(n) = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1) \\times (n + 2)}{6}\n     \\]\n   - This formula comes from the fact that the nth tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers, and each triangular number can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first k natural numbers.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `tetrahedral_number(n)`.\n   - Calculate the nth tetrahedral number using the formula: \n     \\[\n     T(n) = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1) \\times (n + 2)}{6}\n     \\]\n   - Return the calculated value.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef tetrahedral_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth tetrahedral number using the formula:\n    # T(n) = n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 6\n    # This formula gives the sum of the first n triangular numbers.\n    return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6\n```\n\nThis function calculates the nth tetrahedral number using the derived formula, which efficiently computes the result in constant time."
