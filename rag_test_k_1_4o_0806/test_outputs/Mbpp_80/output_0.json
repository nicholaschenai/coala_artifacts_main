    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth tetrahedral number. A tetrahedral number represents a pyramid with a triangular base and three sides (a tetrahedron). The nth tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth tetrahedral number, we can use the formula for tetrahedral numbers: \n   \\[\n   T(n) = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1) \\times (n + 2)}{6}\n   \\]\n   This formula is derived from the sum of the first n triangular numbers. We will implement this formula in a function to compute the nth tetrahedral number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function tetrahedral_number(n):\n       Calculate the nth tetrahedral number using the formula:\n       T(n) = (n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) / 6\n       Return the calculated tetrahedral number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef tetrahedral_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth tetrahedral number using the formula:\n    # T(n) = (n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) / 6\n    # This formula gives the sum of the first n triangular numbers.\n    return (n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) // 6\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth tetrahedral number by applying the formula directly. The use of integer division `//` ensures that the result is an integer, as expected for tetrahedral numbers.",
