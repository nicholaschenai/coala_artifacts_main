        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that checks if a given string can be interpreted as an integer. If the string represents an integer, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Definition of an Integer String**: A string represents an integer if it consists solely of digits, possibly prefixed with a single '+' or '-' sign.\n2. **Steps to Check**:\n   - If the string is empty, it cannot represent an integer.\n   - If the string starts with a '+' or '-', remove this sign for further checks.\n   - After removing the sign (if any), check if the remaining part of the string consists only of digits.\n   - If it does, the string represents an integer; otherwise, it does not.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction check_integer(s):\n    if s is empty:\n        return False\n    if s starts with '+' or '-':\n        remove the first character\n    return True if the remaining string consists only of digits, else False\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_integer(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is empty\n    if not s:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the string starts with '+' or '-'\n    if s[0] in ('+', '-'):\n        # Remove the sign for further checks\n        s = s[1:]\n    \n    # Check if the remaining string consists only of digits\n    return s.isdigit()\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the string is empty, which cannot represent an integer. It then checks for a leading '+' or '-' and removes it if present. Finally, it checks if the remaining string consists only of digits using the `isdigit()` method, which returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, otherwise `False`."

Balance validation\n\n    We want to check if a given string is balanced or not.\n\n    At first suppose there is only one type of bracket.\n    For this case there exists a very simple algorithm.\n    Let $\\text{depth}$ be the current number of open brackets.\n    Initially $\\text{depth} = 0$.\n    We iterate over all character of the string, if the current bracket character is an opening bracket, then we increment $\\text{depth}$, otherwise we decrement it.\n    If at any time the variable $\\text{depth}$ gets negative, or at the end it is different from $0$, then the string is not a balanced sequence.\n    Otherwise it is.\n\n    If there are several bracket types involved, then the algorithm needs to be changes.\n    Instead of a counter $\\text{depth}$ we create a stack, in which we will store all opening brackets that we meet.\n    If the current bracket character is an opening one, we put it onto the stack.\n    If it is a closing one, then we check if the stack is non-empty, and if the top element of the stack is of the same type as the current closing bracket.\n    If both conditions are fulfilled, then we remove the opening bracket from the stack.\n    If at any time one of the conditions is not fulfilled, or at the end the stack is not empty, then the string is not balanced.\n    Otherwise it is.\n\n    ## Number of balanced sequences\n\n    ### Formula\n\n    The number of balanced bracket sequences with only one bracket type can be calculated using the [Catalan numbers](catalan-numbers.md).\n    The number of balanced bracket sequences of length $2n$ ($n$ pairs of brackets) is:\n\n    $$\\frac{1}{n+1} \\binom{2n}{n}$$\n\n    If we allow $k$ types of brackets, then each pair be of any of the $k$ types (independently of the others), thus the number of balanced bracket sequences is:\n\n    $$\\frac{1}{n+1} \\binom{2n}{n} k^n$$\n\n    ### Dynamic programming\n\n    On the other hand these numbers can be computed using **dynamic programming**.\n    Let $d[n]$ be the number of regular bracket sequences with $n$ pairs of bracket.\n    Note that in the first position there is always an opening bracket.\n    And somewhere later is the corresponding closing bracket of the pair.\n    It is clear that inside this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence, and similarly after this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence.\n    So to compute $d[n]$, we will look at how many balanced sequences of $i$ pairs of brackets are inside this first bracket pair, and how many balanced sequences with $n-1-i$ pairs are after this pair.\n    Consequently the formula has the form:\n\n    $$d[n] = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d[i] \\cdot d[n-1-i]$$\n\n    The initial value for this recurrence is $d[0] = 1$.\n\n    ## Finding the lexicographical next balanced sequence\n\n    Here we only consider the case with one valid bracket type.\n\n    Given a balanced sequence, we have to find the next (in lexicographical order) balanced sequence.\n\n    It should be obvious, that we have to find the rightmost opening bracket, which we can replace by a closing bracket without violation the condition, that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets up to this position.\n    After replacing this position, we can fill the remaining part of the string with the lexicographically minimal one: i.e. first with as much opening brackets as possible, and then fill up the remaining positions with closing brackets.\n    In other words we try to leave a long as possible prefix unchanged, and the suffix gets replaced by the lexicographically minimal one.\n\n    To find this position, we can iterate over the character from right to left, and maintain the balance $\\text{depth}$ of open and closing brackets.\n    When we meet an opening brackets, we will decrement $\\text{depth}$, and when we meet a closing bracket, we increase it.\n    If we are at some point meet an opening bracket, and the balance after processing this symbol is positive, then we have found the rightmost position that we can change.\n    We change the symbol, compute the number of opening and closing brackets that we have to add to the right side, and arrange them in the lexicographically minimal way.\n\n    If we find do suitable position, then this sequence is already the maximal possible one, and there is no answer.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_balanced_brackets_sequence}\n    bool next_balanced_sequence(string & s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int depth = 0;\n        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (s[i] == '(')\n                depth--;\n            else\n                depth++;\n\n            if (s[i] == '(' && depth > 0) {\n                depth--;\n                int open = (n - i - 1 - depth) / 2;\n                int close = n - i - 1 - open;\n                string next = s.substr(0, i) + ')' + string(open, '(') + string(close, ')');\n                s.swap(next);\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

If the conversion is successful, it returns `True`, indicating that the string is a valid integer representation.
