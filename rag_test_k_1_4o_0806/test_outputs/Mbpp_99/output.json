    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a decimal (base-10) integer as input and returns its binary (base-2) representation as a string. The binary string should not have any leading zeros.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To convert a decimal number to binary, we can repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. These remainders represent the binary digits (bits) of the number, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost). We continue this process until the number becomes zero. The binary representation is then constructed by reading the remainders in reverse order. Finally, we return this binary string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function decimal_to_binary(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return \"0\"\n       initialize an empty string binary_representation\n       while n is greater than 0:\n           remainder = n % 2\n           prepend remainder to binary_representation\n           n = n // 2\n       return binary_representation\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    # Special case for zero\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to store the binary representation\n    binary_representation = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop until the number becomes zero\n    while n > 0:\n        # Get the remainder when n is divided by 2 (this is the current binary digit)\n        remainder = n % 2\n        # Prepend the remainder to the binary representation string\n        binary_representation = str(remainder) + binary_representation\n        # Update n to be the quotient of n divided by 2\n        n = n // 2\n    \n    # Return the binary representation string\n    return binary_representation\n```\n\nThis code will correctly convert a decimal number to its binary representation without leading zeros, as required.",
