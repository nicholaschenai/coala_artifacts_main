    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that calculates the number of divisors of a given integer. For example, the number 15 has four divisors: 1, 3, 5, and 15.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the number of divisors of a given integer `n`, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` and check if each number divides `n` without leaving a remainder. If it does, it is a divisor, and we increment our count. This approach is straightforward but can be optimized by only iterating up to the square root of `n`, as divisors come in pairs.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function divisor(n):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for i from 1 to sqrt(n):\n           if n is divisible by i:\n               increment count by 1\n               if i is not equal to n // i:\n                   increment count by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the count of divisors\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to the square root of n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If i is a divisor, increment the count\n            count += 1\n            # Check if the corresponding divisor n // i is different from i\n            if i != n // i:\n                # If so, increment the count for the pair divisor\n                count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of divisors\n    return count\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently counts the divisors by leveraging the fact that divisors come in pairs, reducing the number of iterations needed.",
