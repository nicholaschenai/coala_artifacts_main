The function should return a new tuple where each element is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate over the elements of the two input tuples simultaneously.\n2. For each pair of elements, we will perform a bitwise AND operation.\n3. We will collect the results of these operations into a new tuple.\n4. Finally, we will return the new tuple.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define the function `and_tuples` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.\n2. Initialize an empty list `result`.\n3. Loop over the elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2` using the `zip` function.\n   - For each pair of elements `(a, b)`, compute `a & b` and append the result to `result`.\n4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple.\n5. Return the resulting tuple.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the bitwise AND operations\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously\n    for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2):\n        # Perform bitwise AND operation and append the result to the list\n        result.append(a & b)\n    \n    # Convert the list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```"

Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n \t\n    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.\n\n    Examples:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 01010000\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n | (n-1) = 01011111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    --------------------\n    ~n        = 10100111\n    ```\n\n    ### Shift operators\n\n    There are two operators for shifting bits.\n\n    -   $\\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.\n        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\gg 2 = 101_2 \\gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\\frac{5}{2^2} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1$.\n        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.\n\n    -   $\\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.\n        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\ll 3 = 101_2 \\ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \\cdot 2^3 = 5 \\cdot 8 = 40$.\n\n        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.\n\n\n    ## Useful tricks\n\n    ### Set/flip/clear a bit\n\n    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.\n    $1 \\ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\\sim(1 \\ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.\n\n    - $n ~|~ (1 \\ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\wedge~ (1 \\ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\&~ \\sim(1 \\ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n\n    ### Check if a bit is set\n\n    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {\n        return (number >> x) & 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2\n\n    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).\n    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.\n    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {\n        return n && !(n & (n - 1));\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Clear the most-right set bit\n\n    The expression $n ~\\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.\n    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.\n    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.\n\n    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 00110100\n    n-1       = 00110011\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 00110000\n    ```\n\n    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm\n\n    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.\n\n    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    int countSetBits(int n)\n    {\n        int count = 0;\n        while (n)\n        {\n            n = n & (n - 1);\n            count++;\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
