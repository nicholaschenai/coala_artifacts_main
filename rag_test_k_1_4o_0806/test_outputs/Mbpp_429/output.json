    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes two tuples of integers as input and returns a new tuple. Each element in the new tuple should be the result of performing a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over the elements of the two input tuples simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of elements, we will perform a bitwise AND operation.\n   - We will collect the results of these operations into a new tuple.\n   - Finally, we will return this new tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n       Initialize an empty list result\n       For each pair of elements (a, b) from tuple1 and tuple2:\n           Compute the bitwise AND of a and b\n           Append the result to the list result\n       Convert the list result to a tuple\n       Return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the bitwise AND operations\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously\n    for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2):\n        # Perform bitwise AND operation on the current pair of elements\n        and_result = a & b\n        # Append the result to the list\n        result.append(and_result)\n    \n    # Convert the list of results to a tuple\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThis function will take two tuples, perform a bitwise AND operation on each pair of corresponding elements, and return a tuple of the results.",
