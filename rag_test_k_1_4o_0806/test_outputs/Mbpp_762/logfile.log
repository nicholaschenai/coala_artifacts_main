INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/762 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

The task is to determine if a given month, represented by a number from 1 to 12, has 30 days. The function should return `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Months with 30 Days**: The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).
2. **Check the Month**: Given a month number, check if it is one of the months identified in step 1.
3. **Return the Result**: If the month number is one of those with 30 days, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

```
function check_monthnumber_number(month_number):
    if month_number is in [4, 6, 9, 11]:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def check_monthnumber_number(month_number: int) -> bool:
    # List of month numbers that have 30 days
    months_with_30_days = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    
    # Check if the given month number is in the list
    if month_number in months_with_30_days:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This solution checks if the given month number is one of the months that have 30 days and returns the appropriate boolean value.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/762 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that determines if a given month, represented by a number from 1 to 12, has 30 days. The function should return `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We know that the months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).
   - The function should check if the input month number is one of these four numbers.
   - If the month number is one of these, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function check_monthnumber_number(month_number):
       If month_number is in the set {4, 6, 9, 11}:
           Return True
       Else:
           Return False
   ```
