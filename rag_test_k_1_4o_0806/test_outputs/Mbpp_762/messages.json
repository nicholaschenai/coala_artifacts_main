The function should return `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Months with 30 Days**: The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).\n2. **Check the Month**: Given a month number, check if it is one of the months identified in step 1.\n3. **Return the Result**: If the month number is one of those with 30 days, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction check_monthnumber_number(month_number):\n    if month_number is in [4, 6, 9, 11]:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_monthnumber_number(month_number: int) -> bool:\n    # List of month numbers that have 30 days\n    months_with_30_days = [4, 6, 9, 11]\n    \n    # Check if the given month number is in the list\n    if month_number in months_with_30_days:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis solution checks if the given month number is one of the months that have 30 days and returns the appropriate boolean value."
