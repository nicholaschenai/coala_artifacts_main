    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that determines if a given month, represented by a number from 1 to 12, has 30 days. The function should return `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We know that the months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).\n   - The function should check if the input month number is one of these four numbers.\n   - If the month number is one of these, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function check_monthnumber_number(month_number):\n       If month_number is in the set {4, 6, 9, 11}:\n           Return True\n       Else:\n           Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_monthnumber_number(month_number: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the given month number is one of the months with 30 days\n    # The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11)\n    if month_number in {4, 6, 9, 11}:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```",
