INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/560 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple containing the union of the elements from both tuples, sorted in ascending order.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, combine the elements of both tuples into a single collection.
   - Remove any duplicate elements to ensure each element appears only once.
   - Sort the resulting collection of unique elements.
   - Convert the sorted collection back into a tuple and return it.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `union_elements` that takes two tuples as arguments.
   - Combine the elements of both tuples into a single list.
   - Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
   - Convert the set back to a list and sort it.
   - Convert the sorted list to a tuple.
   - Return the resulting tuple.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def union_elements(t1: tuple, t2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Combine both tuples into a single list
    combined_list = list(t1) + list(t2)
    
    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_elements = set(combined_list)
    
    # Convert the set back to a list and sort it
    sorted_list = sorted(unique_elements)
    
    # Convert the sorted list to a tuple
    result_tuple = tuple(sorted_list)
    
    # Return the resulting tuple
    return result_tuple
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and uses Python's built-in data structures and functions to achieve the desired result.

    Chapter: Data structures
    Section: Comparison to sorting
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Comparison to sorting}

    It is often possible to solve a problem
    using either data structures or sorting.
    Sometimes there are remarkable differences
    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,
    which may be hidden in their time complexities.

    Let us consider a problem where
    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$
    that both contain $n$ elements.
    Our task is to calculate the number of elements
    that belong to both of the lists.
    For example, for the lists
    \[A = [5,2,8,9] \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\]
    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5
    and 9 belong to both of the lists.

    A straightforward solution to the problem is
    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,
    but next we will focus on
    more efficient algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,
    and after this, we iterate through the elements
    of $B$ and check for each elements if it
    also belongs to $A$.
    This is efficient because the elements of $A$
    are in a set.
    Using the \texttt{set} structure,
    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,
    so instead of the \texttt{set} structure
    we can also use the \texttt{unordered\_set} structure.
    This is an easy way to make the algorithm
    more efficient, because we only have to change
    the underlying data structure.
    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.
    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.
    After this, we iterate through both the lists
    at the same time and find the common elements.
    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n)$,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    so the total time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    The following table shows how efficient
    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and
    the elements of the lists are random
    integers between $1 \ldots 10^9$:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\
    $2 \cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\
    $3 \cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\
    $4 \cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\
    $5 \cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that
    they use different set structures.
    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on
    the running time, because Algorithm 2
    is 4â€“5 times faster than Algorithm 1.

    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3
    which uses sorting.
    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.
    Interestingly, the time complexity of both
    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \log n)$,
    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.
    This can be explained by the fact that
    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done
    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.
    On the other hand,
    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree
    during the whole algorithm.
