        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where only the vowels in the original string are reversed. The consonants and other characters should remain in their original positions. The vowels in this context are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Identify all the vowels in the input string and store them in a list.\n2. Reverse the list of vowels.\n3. Create a new list to build the result string.\n4. Iterate through the original string:\n   - If the character is a vowel, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed list.\n   - If the character is not a vowel, keep it unchanged.\n5. Join the list into a string and return it.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `reverse_vowels` that takes a string `s`.\n2. Create a set of vowels for quick lookup.\n3. Initialize an empty list `vowels` to store the vowels from the string.\n4. Iterate over each character in the string `s`:\n   - If the character is a vowel, append it to the `vowels` list.\n5. Reverse the `vowels` list.\n6. Initialize an empty list `result` to build the final string.\n7. Initialize a counter `vowel_index` to 0.\n8. Iterate over each character in the string `s`:\n   - If the character is a vowel, append the vowel at `vowel_index` from the reversed `vowels` list to `result` and increment `vowel_index`.\n   - If the character is not a vowel, append it unchanged to `result`.\n9. Join the `result` list into a string and return it.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef reverse_vowels(s: str) -> str:\n    # Define a set of vowels for quick lookup\n    vowels_set = set('aeiouAEIOU')\n    \n    # Extract all vowels from the string\n    vowels = [char for char in s if char in vowels_set]\n    \n    # Reverse the list of vowels\n    vowels.reverse()\n    \n    # Initialize a list to build the result string\n    result = []\n    \n    # Initialize a counter to track the position in the reversed vowels list\n    vowel_index = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the original string\n    for char in s:\n        if char in vowels_set:\n            # If the character is a vowel, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed list\n            result.append(vowels[vowel_index])\n            vowel_index += 1\n        else:\n            # If the character is not a vowel, keep it unchanged\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return it\n    return ''.join(result)\n```"

Find all the pairs $(i, j)$ such that substring $s[i\\dots j]$ is a palindrome. String $t$ is a palindrome when $t = t_{rev}$ ($t_{rev}$ is a reversed string for $t$).\n\n    ## More precise statement\n\n    In the worst case string might have up to $O(n^2)$ palindromic substrings, and at the first glance it seems that there is no linear algorithm for this problem.\n\n    But the information about the palindromes can be kept **in a compact way**: for each position $i$ we will find the number of non-empty palindromes centered at this position.\n\n    Palindromes with a common center form a contiguous chain, that is if we have a palindrome of length $l$ centered in $i$, we also have palindromes of lengths $l-2$, $l-4$ and so on also centered in $i$. Therefore, we will collect the information about all palindromic substrings in this way.\n\n    Palindromes of odd and even lengths are accounted for separately as $d_{odd}[i]$ and $d_{even}[i]$. For the palindromes of even length we assume that they're centered in the position $i$ if their two central characters are $s[i]$ and $s[i-1]$.\n\n    For instance, string $s = abababc$ has three palindromes with odd length with centers in the position $s[3] = b$, i. e. $d_{odd}[3] = 3$:\n\n    $$a\\ \\overbrace{b\\ a\\ \\underbrace{b}_{s_3}\\ a\\ b}^{d_{odd}[3]=3} c$$\n\n    And string $s = cbaabd$ has two palindromes with even length with centers in the position $s[3] = a$, i. e. $d_{even}[3] = 2$:\n\n    $$c\\ \\overbrace{b\\ a\\ \\underbrace{a}_{s_3}\\ b}^{d_{even}[3]=2} d$$\n\n    It's a surprising fact that there is an algorithm, which is simple enough, that calculates these \"palindromity arrays\" $d_{odd}[]$ and $d_{even}[]$ in linear time. The algorithm is described in this article.\n\n    ## Solution\n\n    In general, this problem has many solutions: with [String Hashing](/string/string-hashing.html) it can be solved in $O(n\\cdot \\log n)$, and with [Suffix Trees](/string/suffix-tree-ukkonen.html) and fast LCA this problem can be solved in $O(n)$.\n\n    But the method described here is **sufficiently** simpler and has less hidden constant in time and memory complexity. This algorithm was discovered by **Glenn K. Manacher** in 1975.\n\n    Another modern way to solve this problem and to deal with palindromes in general is through the so-called palindromic tree, or eertree.\n\n    ## Trivial algorithm\n\n    To avoid ambiguities in the further description we denote what \"trivial algorithm\" is.\n\n    It's the algorithm that does the following. For each center position $i$ it tries to increase the answer by one as long as it's possible, comparing a pair of corresponding characters each time.\n\n    Such an algorithm is slow, it can calculate the answer only in $O(n^2)$.\n\n    The implementation of the trivial algorithm is:\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        s = \"$\" + s + \"^\";\n        vector<int> p(n + 2);\n        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {\n                p[i]++;\n            }\n        }\n        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
