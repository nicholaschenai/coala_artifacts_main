INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/638 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that calculates the wind chill index based on the given wind velocity in kilometers per hour (km/h) and temperature in Celsius. The result should be rounded to the nearest integer.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Wind Chill Formula**: The wind chill index is a measure of how cold it feels when the wind is factored in with the actual air temperature. The formula to calculate the wind chill index in Celsius is:
   \[
   WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times T - 11.37 \times V^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times T \times V^{0.16}
   \]
   where \( T \) is the temperature in Celsius and \( V \) is the wind velocity in km/h.

2. **Calculate the Wind Chill Index**: Use the formula to compute the wind chill index using the provided temperature and wind velocity.

3. **Round the Result**: Round the calculated wind chill index to the nearest integer.

4. **Return the Result**: Return the rounded wind chill index.

## Pseudocode

```
function wind_chill(velocity, temperature):
    calculate WCI using the formula:
        WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * (velocity ** 0.16) + 0.3965 * temperature * (velocity ** 0.16)
    round WCI to the nearest integer
    return the rounded WCI
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def wind_chill(velocity: float, temperature: float) -> int:
    # Calculate the wind chill index using the given formula
    WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * (velocity ** 0.16) + 0.3965 * temperature * (velocity ** 0.16)
    
    # Round the wind chill index to the nearest integer
    rounded_WCI = round(WCI)
    
    # Return the rounded wind chill index
    return rounded_WCI

        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\frac{x+y \sqrt{n}}{z}$.

        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

            ```py
            x, k = map(int, input().split())

            mod = 10**9+7
        
            # compose (A[0]*x + A[1]) / (A[2]*x + A[3]) and (B[0]*x + B[1]) / (B[2]*x + B[3])
