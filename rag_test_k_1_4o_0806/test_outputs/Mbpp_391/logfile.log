INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/391 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes three lists as input: one list of IDs, one list of names, and one list of scores. The function should return a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a nested structure. Each dictionary should have an ID as the key, and the value should be another dictionary with the name as the key and the score as the value.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over the indices of the input lists since they are of the same length.
   - For each index, we will create a dictionary where the key is the ID from the first list.
   - The value of this key will be another dictionary where the key is the name from the second list and the value is the score from the third list.
   - We will append each of these dictionaries to a result list.
   - Finally, we will return the result list.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function convert_list_dictionary with three parameters: ids, names, scores
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each index i from 0 to length of ids - 1
           Create a dictionary with ids[i] as the key
           The value of this key is another dictionary with names[i] as the key and scores[i] as the value
           Append this dictionary to the result list
       Return the result list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def convert_list_dictionary(ids, names, scores):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the input lists
    for i in range(len(ids)):
        # Create a nested dictionary for each index
        nested_dict = {ids[i]: {names[i]: scores[i]}}
        # Append the nested dictionary to the result list
        result.append(nested_dict)
    
    # Return the final list of nested dictionaries
    return result
```

This code will take the three lists and convert them into a list of nested dictionaries as specified in the problem statement.

    Title: Counting labeled graphs
    Part: 1/1
    # Counting labeled graphs

    ## Labeled graphs

    Let the number of vertices in a graph be $n$.
    We have to compute the number $G_n$ of labeled graphs with $n$ vertices (labeled means that the vertices are marked with the numbers from $1$ to $n$).
    The edges of the graphs are considered undirected, and loops and multiple edges are forbidden.

    We consider the set of all possible edges of the graph.
    For each edge $(i, j)$ we can assume that $i < j$ (because the graph is undirected, and there are no loops).
    Therefore the set of all edges has the cardinality $\binom{n}{2}$, i.e. $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

    Since any labeled graph is uniquely determined by its edges, the number of labeled graphs with $n$ vertices is equal to:

    $$G_n = 2^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$$

    ## Connected labeled graphs

    Here, we additionally impose the restriction that the graph has to be connected.

    Let's denote the required number of connected graphs with $n$ vertices as $C_n$.

    We will first discuss how many **disconnected** graphs exists.
    Then the number of connected graphs will be $G_n$ minus the number of disconnected graphs.
    Even more, we will count the number of **disconnected, rooted graphs**.A rooted graph is a graph, where we emphasize one vertex by labeling it as root.
    Obviously we have $n$ possibilities to root a graph with $n$ labeled vertices, therefore we will need to divide the number of disconnected rooted graphs by $n$ at the end to get the number of disconnected graphs.

    The root vertex will appear in a connected component of size $1, \dots n-1$.
    There are $k \binom{n}{k} C_k G_{n-k}$ graphs such that the root vertex is in a connected component with $k$ vertices (there are $\binom{n}{k}$ ways to choose $k$ vertices for the component, these are connected in one of $C_k$ ways, the root vertex can be any of the $k$ vertices, and the remainder $n-k$ vertices can be connected/disconnected in any way, which gives a factor of $G_{n-k}$).
    Therefore the number of disconnected graphs with $n$ vertices is:

    $$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k \binom{n}{k} C_k G_{n-k}$$

    And finally the number of connected graphs is:

    $$C_n = G_n - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k \binom{n}{k} C_k G_{n-k}$$

    ## Labeled graphs with $k$ connected components {data-toc-label="Labeled graphs with k connected components"}

    Based on the formula from the previous section, we will learn how to count the number of labeled graphs with $n$ vertices and $k$ connected components.

    This number can be computed using dynamic programming.
    We will compute $D[i][j]$ - the number of labeled graphs with $i$ vertices and $j$ components - for each $i \le n$ and $j \le k$.

    Let's discuss how to compute the next element $D[n][k]$ if we already know the previous values.
    We use a common approach, we take the last vertex (index $n$).
    This vertex belongs to some component.
    If the size of this component be $s$, then there are $\binom{n-1}{s-1}$ ways to choose such a set of vertices, and $C_s$ ways to connect them.After removing this component from the graph we have $n-s$ remaining vertices with $k-1$ connected components.
    Therefore we obtain the following recurrence relation:

    $$D[n][k] = \sum_{s=1}^{n} \binom{n-1}{s-1} C_s D[n-s][k-1]$$
