We can use this function to convert the input list to a tuple and return it.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `list_tuple` that takes a single parameter `lst`.\n   - Use the `tuple()` function to convert `lst` to a tuple.\n   - Return the resulting tuple.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef list_tuple(lst: list) -> tuple:\n    # Convert the input list to a tuple using the tuple() function\n    result = tuple(lst)\n    # Return the resulting tuple\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take a list as input and return a tuple with the same elements, satisfying the problem requirements."
