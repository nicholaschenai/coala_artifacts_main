INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/276 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \( V = \pi \times r^2 \times h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: \( V = \pi \times r^2 \times h \).
   - Calculate the square of the radius.
   - Multiply the squared radius by the height.
   - Multiply the result by \( \pi \) to get the volume.
   - Return the calculated volume.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function volume_cylinder with parameters radius and height
       Calculate the square of the radius
       Calculate the volume using the formula: Ï€ * (radius squared) * height
       Return the calculated volume
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def volume_cylinder(radius: float, height: float) -> float:
    # Import the math module to access the value of Ï€ (pi)
    import math
    
    # Calculate the square of the radius
    radius_squared = radius ** 2
    
    # Calculate the volume using the formula: Ï€ * (radius squared) * height
    volume = math.pi * radius_squared * height
    
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
```

This function will correctly compute the volume of a cylinder using the given radius and height, utilizing the mathematical constant Ï€ from the `math` module.

    Title: Circle-Circle Intersection
    Part: 1/1
    # Circle-Circle Intersection

    You are given two circles on a 2D plane, each one described as coordinates of its center and its radius. Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).

    ## Solution

    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).

    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$

    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$x \cdot (-2x_2) + y \cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$

    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:

    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$

    $$\begin{align}
    A &= -2x_2 \\
    B &= -2y_2 \\
    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2
    \end{align}$$

    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).

    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.

   We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height.
