    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z', but not at the start or end of the string. The function should return `True` if such a 'z' exists and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, check if the string is long enough to have a middle section (at least 3 characters long).\n   - If the string is too short, return `False` because 'z' cannot be in the middle.\n   - Otherwise, check the substring that excludes the first and last characters for the presence of 'z'.\n   - If 'z' is found in this middle section, return `True`.\n   - If 'z' is not found, return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function text_match_wordz_middle(s):\n       if length of s is less than 3:\n           return False\n       middle_substring = s[1:-1]\n       if 'z' in middle_substring:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is too short to have a middle section\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Extract the middle part of the string, excluding the first and last characters\n    middle_substring = s[1:-1]\n    \n    # Check if 'z' is present in the middle substring\n    if 'z' in middle_substring:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function checks for the presence of 'z' in the middle of the string, ensuring it is not at the start or end.",
