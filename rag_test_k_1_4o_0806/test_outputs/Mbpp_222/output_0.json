    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. If all elements are of the same type, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the elements of the tuple and compare their data types. We can use the `type()` function to get the data type of each element. We will compare each element's type to the type of the first element in the tuple. If we find any element with a different type, we return `False`. If we finish checking all elements and they all have the same type, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function check_type that takes a tuple as input\n       If the tuple is empty, return True (since there are no differing types)\n       Get the type of the first element in the tuple\n       For each element in the tuple\n           If the type of the current element is not the same as the type of the first element\n               Return False\n       Return True (all elements have the same type)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_type(t: tuple) -> bool:\n    # If the tuple is empty, return True as there are no differing types\n    if not t:\n        return True\n    \n    # Get the type of the first element\n    first_type = type(t[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the tuple\n    for element in t:\n        # If the type of the current element is not the same as the first element's type\n        if type(element) != first_type:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all elements have the same type, return True\n    return True\n```",
