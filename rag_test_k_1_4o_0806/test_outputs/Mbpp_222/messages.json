If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, we need to determine the data type of the first element in the tuple.\n   - Then, we will iterate through the rest of the elements in the tuple.\n   - For each element, we will check if its data type matches the data type of the first element.\n   - If we find any element with a different data type, we will return `False`.\n   - If we complete the iteration without finding any mismatched data types, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function check_type with parameter tuple_data\n       If tuple_data is empty, return True (since there are no elements to compare)\n       Get the data type of the first element in tuple_data and store it in a variable first_type\n       For each element in tuple_data\n           If the data type of the element is not equal to first_type\n               Return False\n       Return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_type(tuple_data: tuple) -> bool:\n    # If the tuple is empty, return True as there are no elements to compare\n    if not tuple_data:\n        return True\n    \n    # Get the data type of the first element\n    first_type = type(tuple_data[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the tuple\n    for element in tuple_data:\n        # If the type of the current element is not the same as the first element's type\n        if type(element) != first_type:\n            # Return False as not all elements have the same type\n            return False\n    \n    # If all elements have the same type, return True\n    return True\n```\n\nThis solution checks the data type of each element in the tuple against the first element's data type and returns `True` only if all elements have the same type."

We can use the `type()` function to get the data type of each element. We will compare each element's type to the type of the first element in the tuple. If we find any element with a different type, we return `False`.
