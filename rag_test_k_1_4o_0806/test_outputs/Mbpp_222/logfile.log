INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/222 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, we need to determine the data type of the first element in the tuple.
   - Then, we will iterate through the rest of the elements in the tuple.
   - For each element, we will check if its data type matches the data type of the first element.
   - If we find any element with a different data type, we will return `False`.
   - If we complete the iteration without finding any mismatched data types, we will return `True`.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function check_type with parameter tuple_data
       If tuple_data is empty, return True (since there are no elements to compare)
       Get the data type of the first element in tuple_data and store it in a variable first_type
       For each element in tuple_data
           If the data type of the element is not equal to first_type
               Return False
       Return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_type(tuple_data: tuple) -> bool:
    # If the tuple is empty, return True as there are no elements to compare
    if not tuple_data:
        return True
    
    # Get the data type of the first element
    first_type = type(tuple_data[0])
    
    # Iterate through each element in the tuple
    for element in tuple_data:
        # If the type of the current element is not the same as the first element's type
        if type(element) != first_type:
            # Return False as not all elements have the same type
            return False
    
    # If all elements have the same type, return True
    return True
```

This solution checks the data type of each element in the tuple against the first element's data type and returns `True` only if all elements have the same type.

   We need to create a function that checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. If all elements are of the same type, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the elements of the tuple and compare their data types. We can use the `type()` function to get the data type of each element. We will compare each element's type to the type of the first element in the tuple. If we find any element with a different type, we return `False`. If we finish checking all elements and they all have the same type, we return `True`.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function check_type that takes a tuple as input
       If the tuple is empty, return True (since there are no differing types)
       Get the type of the first element in the tuple
       For each element in the tuple
