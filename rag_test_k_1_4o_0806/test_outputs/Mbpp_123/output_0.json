    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to a given number. An amicable number is part of a pair of numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number.\n   - Then, for each number from 1 to the specified number, we will check if it forms an amicable pair with another number.\n   - If a number `a` has a sum of divisors `b`, and `b` has a sum of divisors `a`, and `a` is not equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are amicable numbers.\n   - We will keep track of all amicable numbers found and sum them up, ensuring we don't double-count any numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function sum_of_divisors(n):\n       initialize sum to 0\n       for each number i from 1 to n-1:\n           if i is a divisor of n:\n               add i to sum\n       return sum\n\n   function amicable_numbers_sum(limit):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       initialize a set to keep track of counted amicable numbers\n       for each number a from 1 to limit:\n           if a is not in the set of counted numbers:\n               calculate b as sum_of_divisors(a)\n               if b is not equal to a and sum_of_divisors(b) is equal to a:\n                   add a and b to the set of counted numbers\n                   add a and b to total_sum\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_divisors(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize sum to 0\n    sum_div = 0\n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n-1\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # If i is a divisor of n, add it to the sum\n        if n % i == 0:\n            sum_div += i\n    return sum_div\n\ndef amicable_numbers_sum(limit: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize total_sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Set to keep track of counted amicable numbers\n    counted = set()\n    # Iterate over each number from 1 to limit\n    for a in range(1, limit + 1):\n        # If a is not already counted\n        if a not in counted:\n            # Calculate b as the sum of divisors of a\n            b = sum_of_divisors(a)\n            # Check if a and b form an amicable pair\n            if b != a and sum_of_divisors(b) == a:\n                # Add both a and b to the counted set\n                counted.add(a)\n                counted.add(b)\n                # Add both a and b to the total sum\n                total_sum += a + b\n    return total_sum\n```",
