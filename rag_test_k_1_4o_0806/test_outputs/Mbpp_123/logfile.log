INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/123 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to a given number `n`. An amicable number is part of a pair of numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other. For example, 220 and 284 are an amicable pair because the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284, and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Proper Divisors**: For a given number, find all its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself).
2. **Sum of Divisors**: Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.
3. **Check Amicable Pair**: For each number up to `n`, check if it forms an amicable pair with another number.
4. **Sum Amicable Numbers**: If a number is part of an amicable pair, add it to the sum. Ensure each number is only counted once.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `sum_of_divisors(num)` that returns the sum of proper divisors of `num`.
2. Define the main function `amicable_numbers_sum(n)`:
   - Initialize a variable `amicable_sum` to 0.
   - Create a set `checked` to keep track of numbers already checked.
   - Loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n`:
     - If `i` is in `checked`, continue to the next iteration.
     - Calculate `sum_i` as the sum of divisors of `i`.
     - If `sum_i` is not equal to `i` and the sum of divisors of `sum_i` is `i`, then `i` and `sum_i` are an amicable pair.
     - Add both `i` and `sum_i` to `amicable_sum`.
     - Add both `i` and `sum_i` to `checked`.
   - Return `amicable_sum`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_of_divisors(num: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the sum of proper divisors of num
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            total += i
    return total

def amicable_numbers_sum(n: int) -> int:
    amicable_sum = 0
    checked = set()
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i in checked:
            continue
        
        sum_i = sum_of_divisors(i)
        
        if sum_i != i and sum_i <= n:
            sum_j = sum_of_divisors(sum_i)
            if sum_j == i:
                amicable_sum += i
                if sum_i <= n:
                    amicable_sum += sum_i
                checked.add(i)
                checked.add(sum_i)
    
    return amicable_sum
```

This code defines a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors and uses it to find and sum all amicable numbers up to `n`. The `checked` set ensures that each number is only considered once, preventing double-counting.

    Title: Number of divisors / sum of divisors
    Part: 1/1
    # Number of divisors / sum of divisors

    In this article we discuss how to compute the number of divisors $d(n)$ and the sum of divisors $\sigma(n)$ of a given number $n$.

    ## Number of divisors

    It should be obvious that the prime factorization of a divisor $d$ has to be a subset of the prime factorization of $n$, e.g. $6 = 2 \cdot 3$ is a divisor of $60 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$.
    So we only need to find all different subsets of the prime factorization of $n$.

    Usually the number of subsets is $2^x$ for a set with $x$ elements.
    However this is no longer true, if there are repeated elements in the set. In our case some prime factors may appear multiple times in the prime factorization of $n$.

    If a prime factor $p$ appears $e$ times in the prime factorization of $n$, then we can use the factor $p$ up to $e$ times in the subset.
    Which means we have $e+1$ choices.

    Therefore if the prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers, then the number of divisors is:

    $$d(n) = (e_1 + 1) \cdot (e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)$$

    A way of thinking about it is the following:

    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then there are obviously $e_1 + 1$ divisors ($1, p_1, p_1^2, \dots, p_1^{e_1}$).

    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then you can arrange all divisors in form of a tabular.

    $$\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
    & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\hline
    1 & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    p_1 & p_1 & p_1 \cdot p_2 & p_1 \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1 \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    p_1^2 & p_1^2 & p_1^2 \cdot p_2 & p_1^2 \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1^2 \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\
    p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2 & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    \end{array}$$

    So the number of divisors is trivially $(e_1 + 1) \cdot (e_2 + 1)$.

    * A similar argument can be made if there are more then two distinct prime factors.


    ```cpp
    long long numberOfDivisors(long long num) {
        long long total = 1;
        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                int e = 0;
                do {
                    e++;
                    num /= i;
                } while (num % i == 0);
                total *= e + 1;
            }
        }
        if (num > 1) {
            total *= 2;
        }
        return total;
    }
    ```

    ## Sum of divisors

    We can use the same argument of the previous section.

    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then the sum is:

    $$1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{e_1} = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1}$$

    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then we can make the same table as before.
      The only difference is that now we now want to compute the sum instead of counting the elements.
      It is easy to see, that the sum of each combination can be expressed as:

    $$\left(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{e_1}\right) \cdot \left(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_2^{e_2}\right)$$

    $$ = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \cdot \frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1}$$

    * In general, for $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ we receive the formula:

    $$\sigma(n) = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \cdot \frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1} \cdots \frac{p_k^{e_k + 1} - 1}{p_k - 1}$$

    ```cpp
    long long SumOfDivisors(long long num) {
        long long total = 1;

        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                int e = 0;
                do {
                    e++;
                    num /= i;
                } while (num % i == 0);

                long long sum = 0, pow = 1;
                do {
                    sum += pow;
                    pow *= i;
                } while (e-- > 0);
                total *= sum;
            }
        }
        if (num > 1) {
            total *= (1 + num);
        }
        return total;
    }
    ```

    ## Multiplicative functions

    A multiplicative function is a function $f(x)$ which satisfies

    $$f(a \cdot b) = f(a) \cdot f(b)$$

    if $a$ and $b$ are coprime.

    Both $d(n)$ and $\sigma(n)$ are multiplicative functions.

    Multiplicative functions have a huge variety of interesting properties, which can be very useful in number theory problems.
    For instance the Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is also multiplicative.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/123 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to a given number. An amicable number is part of a pair of numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, we need a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number.
   - Then, for each number from 1 to the specified number, we will check if it forms an amicable pair with another number.
   - If a number `a` has a sum of divisors `b`, and `b` has a sum of divisors `a`, and `a` is not equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are amicable numbers.
   - We will keep track of all amicable numbers found and sum them up, ensuring we don't double-count any numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function sum_of_divisors(n):
       initialize sum to 0
       for each number i from 1 to n-1:
           if i is a divisor of n:
               add i to sum
       return sum

   function amicable_numbers_sum(limit):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       initialize a set to keep track of counted amicable numbers
