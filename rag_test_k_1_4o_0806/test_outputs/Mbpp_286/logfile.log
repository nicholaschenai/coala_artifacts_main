INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/286 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the largest sum of a contiguous subarray in a modified array. The modified array is created by repeating a given array `k` times. For example, if the array is `[10, 20, -30, -1]` and `k` is 3, the modified array would be `[10, 20, -30, -1, 10, 20, -30, -1, 10, 20, -30, -1]`. We need to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within this modified array.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a repeated array. The key challenge is efficiently handling the repetition without explicitly constructing the large array.

2. **Kadane's Algorithm**: This is a well-known algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a single array. We can use this algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in the original array.

3. **Handling Repetition**:
   - If `k == 1`, simply use Kadane's algorithm on the original array.
   - If `k > 1`, consider the following:
     - Calculate the maximum subarray sum for one instance of the array using Kadane's algorithm.
     - Calculate the total sum of the array.
     - If the total sum is positive, it means that repeating the array increases the potential maximum sum. We can consider the sum of the entire array repeated `k-2` times plus the best prefix and suffix sums from the array.
     - Calculate the best prefix sum (maximum sum starting from the beginning) and the best suffix sum (maximum sum ending at the end) of the array.
     - The maximum sum can be the maximum of:
       - The maximum subarray sum found using Kadane's algorithm.
       - The best prefix sum plus the best suffix sum plus the total sum of the array multiplied by `(k-2)`.

4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the array has only negative numbers or zeros.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_sub_array_sum_repeated(arr, n, k):
    max_kadane = kadane(arr)
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    if k == 1:
        return max_kadane
    
    best_prefix_sum = calculate_best_prefix_sum(arr)
    best_suffix_sum = calculate_best_suffix_sum(arr)
    
    if total_sum > 0:
        return max(max_kadane, best_prefix_sum + best_suffix_sum + total_sum * (k - 2))
    else:
        return max(max_kadane, best_prefix_sum + best_suffix_sum)

function kadane(arr):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]
    for i from 1 to length(arr) - 1:
        max_ending_here = max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i])
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

function calculate_best_prefix_sum(arr):
    best_prefix_sum = current_sum = 0
    for i from 0 to length(arr) - 1:
        current_sum += arr[i]
        best_prefix_sum = max(best_prefix_sum, current_sum)
    return best_prefix_sum

function calculate_best_suffix_sum(arr):
    best_suffix_sum = current_sum = 0
    for i from length(arr) - 1 to 0:
        current_sum += arr[i]
        best_suffix_sum = max(best_suffix_sum, current_sum)
    return best_suffix_sum
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def kadane(arr):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        max_ending_here = max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i])
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

    return best_prefix_sum

        current_sum += arr[i]
        best_suffix_sum = max(best_suffix_sum, current_sum)
    return best_suffix_sum

    best_suffix_sum = calculate_best_suffix_sum(arr)
    
    if total_sum > 0:
        return max(max_kadane, best_prefix_sum + best_suffix_sum + total_sum * (k - 2))
    else:

    \section{Maximum subarray sum}

    \index{maximum subarray sum}

    There are often several possible algorithms
    for solving a problem such that their
    time complexities are different.
    This section discusses a classic problem that
    has a straightforward $O(n^3)$ solution.
    However, by designing a better algorithm, it
    is possible to solve the problem in $O(n^2)$
    time and even in $O(n)$ time.

    Given an array of $n$ numbers,
    our task is to calculate the
    \key{maximum subarray sum}, i.e.,
    the largest possible sum of 
    a sequence of consecutive values
    in the array\footnote{J. Bentley's
    book \emph{Programming Pearls} \cite{ben86} made the problem popular.}.
    The problem is interesting when there may be
    negative values in the array.
    For example, in the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{samepage}
    the following subarray produces the maximum sum $10$:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (6,1);
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \end{samepage}

    We assume that an empty subarray is allowed,
    so the maximum subarray sum is always at least $0$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    A straightforward way to solve the problem
    is to go through all possible subarrays,
    calculate the sum of values in each subarray and maintain
    the maximum sum.
    The following code implements this algorithm:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int k = a; k <= b; k++) {
                sum += array[k];
            }
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The variables \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} fix the first and
    last index of the subarray,
    and the sum of values is calculated to the variable \texttt{sum}.
    The variable \texttt{best} contains the maximum sum found during the search.

    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^3)$,
    because it consists of three nested loops 
    that go through the input.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is easy to make Algorithm 1 more efficient
    by removing one loop from it.
    This is possible by calculating the sum at the same
    time when the right end of the subarray moves.
    The result is the following code:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            sum += array[b];
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this change, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Surprisingly, it is possible to solve the problem
    in $O(n)$ time\footnote{In \cite{ben86}, this linear-time algorithm
    is attributed to J. B. Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes
    called \index{Kadane's algorithm} \key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means
    that just one loop is enough.
    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,
    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.
    After this, the answer for the problem is the
    maximum of those sums.

    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray
    that ends at position $k$.
    There are two possibilities:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.
    \item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends
    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.
    \end{enumerate}

    In the latter case, since we want to
    find a subarray with maximum sum,
    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$
    should also have the maximum sum.
    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently
    by calculating the maximum subarray sum
    for each ending position from left to right.

    The following code implements the algorithm:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0, sum = 0;
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);
        best = max(best,sum);
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The algorithm only contains one loop
    that goes through the input,
    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.
    This is also the best possible time complexity,
    because any algorithm for the problem
    has to examine all array elements at least once.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    It is interesting to study how efficient 
    algorithms are in practice.
    The following table shows the running times
    of the above algorithms for different
    values of $n$ on a modern computer.

    In each test, the input was generated randomly.
    The time needed for reading the input was not
    measured.

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    array size $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^2$ & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^3$ & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^4$ & > $10.0$ s & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^5$ & > $10.0$ s & $5.3$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^6$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^7$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    The comparison shows that all algorithms
    are efficient when the input size is small,
    but larger inputs bring out remarkable
    differences in the running times of the algorithms.
    Algorithm 1 becomes slow
    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2
    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.
    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process
    even the largest inputs instantly.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/286 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the largest sum of a contiguous subarray in a new array that is formed by repeating a given array `k` times. For example, if the array is `[10, 20, -30, -1]` and `k` is 3, the new array would be `[10, 20, -30, -1, 10, 20, -30, -1, 10, 20, -30, -1]`. We need to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within this repeated array.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, we need to understand that repeating the array `k` times can be handled without actually constructing the large array.
   - We can use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in a single pass of the array.
   - To handle the repetition, we need to consider the possibility of wrapping around the array. This means that the maximum subarray might start in one repetition and end in another.
   - We can calculate the maximum subarray sum for one instance of the array and also consider the sum of the entire array to see if wrapping around gives a better result.
   - If the sum of the array is positive, it means that adding more repetitions can increase the sum. We can calculate the potential maximum sum by considering the sum of the array and the maximum subarray sum that wraps around.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function max_sub_array_sum_repeated(arr, n, k):
       max_ending_here = 0
       max_so_far = 0

       max_suffix_sum = 0
       current_prefix_sum = 0
       current_suffix_sum = 0

       for i from 0 to n-1:
           total_sum += arr[i]
           max_ending_here = max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i])
           max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)

           max_prefix_sum = max(max_prefix_sum, current_prefix_sum)
