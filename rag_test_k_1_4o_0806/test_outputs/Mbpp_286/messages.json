        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the largest sum of a contiguous subarray in a modified array. The modified array is created by repeating a given array `k` times. For example, if the array is `[10, 20, -30, -1]` and `k` is 3, the modified array would be `[10, 20, -30, -1, 10, 20, -30, -1, 10, 20, -30, -1]`. We need to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within this modified array.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a repeated array. The key challenge is efficiently handling the repetition without explicitly constructing the large array.\n\n2. **Kadane's Algorithm**: This is a well-known algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a single array. We can use this algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in the original array.\n\n3. **Handling Repetition**:\n   - If `k == 1`, simply use Kadane's algorithm on the original array.\n   - If `k > 1`, consider the following:\n     - Calculate the maximum subarray sum for one instance of the array using Kadane's algorithm.\n     - Calculate the total sum of the array.\n     - If the total sum is positive, it means that repeating the array increases the potential maximum sum. We can consider the sum of the entire array repeated `k-2` times plus the best prefix and suffix sums from the array.\n     - Calculate the best prefix sum (maximum sum starting from the beginning) and the best suffix sum (maximum sum ending at the end) of the array.\n     - The maximum sum can be the maximum of:\n       - The maximum subarray sum found using Kadane's algorithm.\n       - The best prefix sum plus the best suffix sum plus the total sum of the array multiplied by `(k-2)`.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the array has only negative numbers or zeros.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_sub_array_sum_repeated(arr, n, k):\n    max_kadane = kadane(arr)\n    total_sum = sum(arr)\n    if k == 1:\n        return max_kadane\n    \n    best_prefix_sum = calculate_best_prefix_sum(arr)\n    best_suffix_sum = calculate_best_suffix_sum(arr)\n    \n    if total_sum > 0:\n        return max(max_kadane, best_prefix_sum + best_suffix_sum + total_sum * (k - 2))\n    else:\n        return max(max_kadane, best_prefix_sum + best_suffix_sum)\n\nfunction kadane(arr):\n    max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]\n    for i from 1 to length(arr) - 1:\n        max_ending_here = max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i])\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n    return max_so_far\n\nfunction calculate_best_prefix_sum(arr):\n    best_prefix_sum = current_sum = 0\n    for i from 0 to length(arr) - 1:\n        current_sum += arr[i]\n        best_prefix_sum = max(best_prefix_sum, current_sum)\n    return best_prefix_sum\n\nfunction calculate_best_suffix_sum(arr):\n    best_suffix_sum = current_sum = 0\n    for i from length(arr) - 1 to 0:\n        current_sum += arr[i]\n        best_suffix_sum = max(best_suffix_sum, current_sum)\n    return best_suffix_sum\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef kadane(arr):\n    max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        max_ending_here = max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i])\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n    return max_so_far\n\ndef calculate_best_prefix_sum(arr):\n    best_prefix_sum = current_sum = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        current_sum += arr[i]\n        best_prefix_sum = max(best_prefix_sum, current_sum)\n    return best_prefix_sum\n\ndef calculate_best_suffix_sum(arr):\n    best_suffix_sum = current_sum = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):\n        current_sum += arr[i]\n        best_suffix_sum = max(best_suffix_sum, current_sum)\n    return best_suffix_sum\n\ndef max_sub_array_sum_repeated(arr, n, k):\n    max_kadane = kadane(arr)\n    total_sum = sum(arr)\n    \n    if k == 1:\n        return max_kadane\n    \n    best_prefix_sum = calculate_best_prefix_sum(arr)\n    best_suffix_sum = calculate_best_suffix_sum(arr)\n    \n    if total_sum > 0:\n        return max(max_kadane, best_prefix_sum + best_suffix_sum + total_sum * (k - 2))\n    else:\n        return max(max_kadane, best_prefix_sum + best_suffix_sum)\n```"

Bentley's\n    book \\emph{Programming Pearls} \\cite{ben86} made the problem popular.}.\n    The problem is interesting when there may be\n    negative values in the array.\n    For example, in the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    \\begin{samepage}\n    the following subarray produces the maximum sum $10$:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (6,1);\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    \\end{samepage}\n\n    We assume that an empty subarray is allowed,\n    so the maximum subarray sum is always at least $0$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    A straightforward way to solve the problem\n    is to go through all possible subarrays,\n    calculate the sum of values in each subarray and maintain\n    the maximum sum.\n    The following code implements this algorithm:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int best = 0;\n    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {\n        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {\n            int sum = 0;\n            for (int k = a; k <= b; k++) {\n                sum += array[k];\n            }\n            best = max(best,sum);\n        }\n    }\n    cout << best << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The variables \\texttt{a} and \\texttt{b} fix the first and\n    last index of the subarray,\n    and the sum of values is calculated to the variable \\texttt{sum}.\n    The variable \\texttt{best} contains the maximum sum found during the search.\n\n    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^3)$,\n    because it consists of three nested loops \n    that go through the input.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    It is easy to make Algorithm 1 more efficient\n    by removing one loop from it.\n    This is possible by calculating the sum at the same\n    time when the right end of the subarray moves.\n    The result is the following code:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int best = 0;\n    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {\n        int sum = 0;\n        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {\n            sum += array[b];\n            best = max(best,sum);\n        }\n    }\n    cout << best << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this change, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 3}\n\n    Surprisingly, it is possible to solve the problem\n    in $O(n)$ time\\footnote{In \\cite{ben86}, this linear-time algorithm\n    is attributed to J. B. Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes\n    called \\index{Kadane's algorithm} \\key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means\n    that just one loop is enough.\n    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,\n    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.\n    After this, the answer for the problem is the\n    maximum of those sums.\n\n    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray\n    that ends at position $k$.\n    There are two possibilities:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.\n    \\item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends\n    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    In the latter case, since we want to\n    find a subarray with maximum sum,\n    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$\n    should also have the maximum sum.\n    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently\n    by calculating the maximum subarray sum\n    for each ending position from left to right.\n\n    The following code implements the algorithm:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int best = 0, sum = 0;\n    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);\n        best = max(best,sum);\n    }\n    cout << best << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The algorithm only contains one loop\n    that goes through the input,\n    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.\n    This is also the best possible time complexity,\n    because any algorithm for the problem\n    has to examine all array elements at least once.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    It is interesting to study how efficient \n    algorithms are in practice.\n    The following table shows the running times\n    of the above algorithms for different\n    values of $n$ on a modern computer.\n\n    In each test, the input was generated randomly.\n    The time needed for reading the input was not\n    measured.\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n    array size $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $10^2$ & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^3$ & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^4$ & > $10.0$ s & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^5$ & > $10.0$ s & $5.3$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^6$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^7$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    The comparison shows that all algorithms\n    are efficient when the input size is small,\n    but larger inputs bring out remarkable\n    differences in the running times of the algorithms.\n    Algorithm 1 becomes slow\n    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2\n    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.\n    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process\n    even the largest inputs instantly.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
