Each tuple contains multiple elements, and we need to extract the last element from each tuple and return these elements as a list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, we will access the last element using negative indexing.\n   - We will collect these last elements into a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return this list of last elements.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define a function named rear_extract that takes a list of tuples as input.\n   Initialize an empty list called result.\n   For each tuple in the input list:\n       Access the last element of the tuple using negative indexing.\n       Append this element to the result list.\n   Return the result list.\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef rear_extract(tuples_list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the last elements of each tuple\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        # Access the last element of the tuple using negative indexing\n        last_element = tup[-1]\n        \n        # Append the last element to the result list\n        result.append(last_element)\n    \n    # Return the list containing the last elements of each tuple\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each tuple in the input list, extracts the last element using negative indexing, and appends it to a result list, which is then returned."
