    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of words. The words in the list should be split based on spaces in the input string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The task is straightforward. We need to split the input string into a list of words using the space character as the delimiter. In Python, this can be easily achieved using the `split()` method of the string, which by default splits the string at spaces and returns a list of words.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function string_to_list with a parameter 's'\n       Use the split method on 's' to split it into a list of words\n       Return the resulting list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef string_to_list(s: str) -> list:\n    # Use the split method to split the string 's' by spaces\n    # This will return a list of words\n    return s.split()\n```",
