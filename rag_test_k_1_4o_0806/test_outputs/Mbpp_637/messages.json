If the selling price is equal to the cost price, it means there is no profit and no loss, and the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will compare the cost price and the selling price.\n   - If the selling price is equal to the cost price, it means there is no profit and no loss, so we return `True`.\n   - If the selling price is not equal to the cost price, it means there is either a profit or a loss, so we return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function noprofit_noloss(cost_price, selling_price):\n       if cost_price is equal to selling_price:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef noprofit_noloss(cost_price: int, selling_price: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the cost price is equal to the selling price\n    if cost_price == selling_price:\n        # If they are equal, there is no profit and no loss\n        return True\n    else:\n        # If they are not equal, there is either a profit or a loss\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function takes two integer inputs, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns a boolean indicating whether there is no profit and no loss."
