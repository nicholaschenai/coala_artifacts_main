### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and combines them into a single integer. For example, given the list `[11, 33, 50]`, the function should return the integer `113350`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Convert Each Integer to a String**: Since integers cannot be concatenated directly, we will first convert each integer in the list to a string.
2. **Concatenate the Strings**: Join all the string representations of the integers together to form a single string.
3. **Convert the Resulting String Back to an Integer**: Finally, convert the concatenated string back to an integer to get the desired result.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `multiple_to_single` that takes a list of integers as input.
2. Convert each integer in the list to a string.
3. Concatenate all the string representations.
4. Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.
5. Return the resulting integer.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def multiple_to_single(numbers: list) -> int:
    # Step 1: Convert each integer in the list to a string
    string_numbers = [str(number) for number in numbers]
    
    # Step 2: Concatenate all the string representations
    concatenated_string = ''.join(string_numbers)
    
    # Step 3: Convert the concatenated string back to an integer
    result = int(concatenated_string)
    
    # Step 4: Return the resulting integer
    return result
```

This function will take a list of integers, convert each to a string, concatenate them, and then convert the result back to an integer, effectively joining the list of integers into a single integer.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
