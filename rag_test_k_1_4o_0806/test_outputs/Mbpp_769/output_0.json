    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the first list and check if it is not present in the second list. If an element from the first list is not found in the second list, we add it to a new list. This new list will be our result, containing all elements that are in the first list but not in the second list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function Diff(list1, list2):\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each element in list1:\n           If the element is not in list2:\n               Append the element to result\n       Return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    # Iterate over each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not present in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not present, add the element to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    # Return the result list containing elements only in the first list\n    return result\n```",
