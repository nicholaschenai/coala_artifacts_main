    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum difference between the two numbers in each pair of a list of tuples. The list contains tuples, and each tuple has two numbers. We need to calculate the difference for each tuple and find the maximum difference among all the tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize a variable to store the maximum difference found so far.\n   - Iterate through each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers.\n   - If this difference is greater than the current maximum difference, update the maximum difference.\n   - After checking all tuples, return the maximum difference found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize max_diff to 0\n   For each tuple (a, b) in the list:\n       Calculate the difference as abs(a - b)\n       If the difference is greater than max_diff:\n           Update max_diff with this difference\n   Return max_diff\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_difference(pairs):\n    # Initialize the maximum difference to 0\n    max_diff = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each pair in the list\n    for a, b in pairs:\n        # Calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers in the pair\n        diff = abs(a - b)\n        \n        # Update max_diff if the current difference is greater\n        if diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = diff\n    \n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_diff\n```",
