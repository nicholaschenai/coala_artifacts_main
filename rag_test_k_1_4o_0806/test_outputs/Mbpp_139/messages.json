The function should return a floating-point number that is close to the expected value when the radius is 10.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula: \\( C = 2 \\times \\pi \\times r \\), where \\( C \\) is the circumference and \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. We will use the value of \\( \\pi \\) as 3.14159 for our calculations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `circle_circumference` that takes one parameter `radius`.\n   - Inside the function, set the value of \\( \\pi \\) to 3.14159.\n   - Calculate the circumference using the formula \\( C = 2 \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius} \\).\n   - Return the calculated circumference.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef circle_circumference(radius: float) -> float:\n    # Define the value of pi\n    pi = 3.14159\n    # Calculate the circumference using the formula C = 2 * pi * radius\n    circumference = 2 * pi * radius\n    # Return the calculated circumference\n    return circumference\n```\n\nThis function will compute the circumference of a circle using the given radius and the constant value of \\( \\pi \\)."

Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).\n\n    ## Solution\n\n    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).\n\n    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:\n\n    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$\n\n    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$\n\n    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:\n\n    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$\n\n    $$x \\cdot (-2x_2) + y \\cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$\n\n    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:\n\n    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    A &= -2x_2 \\\\\n    B &= -2y_2 \\\\\n    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).\n\n    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
