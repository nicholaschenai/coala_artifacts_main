INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/139 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The function should return a floating-point number that is close to the expected value when the radius is 10.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula: \( C = 2 \times \pi \times r \), where \( C \) is the circumference and \( r \) is the radius of the circle. We will use the value of \( \pi \) as 3.14159 for our calculations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `circle_circumference` that takes one parameter `radius`.
   - Inside the function, set the value of \( \pi \) to 3.14159.
   - Calculate the circumference using the formula \( C = 2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \).
   - Return the calculated circumference.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def circle_circumference(radius: float) -> float:
    # Define the value of pi
    pi = 3.14159
    # Calculate the circumference using the formula C = 2 * pi * radius
    circumference = 2 * pi * radius
    # Return the calculated circumference
    return circumference
```

This function will compute the circumference of a circle using the given radius and the constant value of \( \pi \).

    Title: Circle-Circle Intersection
    Part: 1/1
    # Circle-Circle Intersection

    You are given two circles on a 2D plane, each one described as coordinates of its center and its radius. Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).

    ## Solution

    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).

    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$

    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$x \cdot (-2x_2) + y \cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$

    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:

    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$

    $$\begin{align}
    A &= -2x_2 \\
    B &= -2y_2 \\
    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2
    \end{align}$$

    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).

    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.

   We need to write a function that calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The function should return a value that is close to a specified result when the radius is 10.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   C = 2 \times \pi \times r

   where \( C \) is the circumference and \( r \) is the radius of the circle. We will use the value of \(\pi\) provided by Python's `math` module to ensure precision.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   - Import the `math` module to access the value of \(\pi\).
   - Define a function `circle_circumference` that takes a single argument `radius`.
   - Calculate the circumference using the formula \( 2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \).
   - Return the calculated circumference.
