INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/266 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube when given the length of one of its sides.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - A cube has six faces, and each face is a square with an area equal to the square of the side length.
   - The lateral surface area of a cube is the sum of the areas of the four vertical faces (excluding the top and bottom faces).
   - Therefore, the lateral surface area can be calculated as four times the area of one face.
   - If the side length of the cube is `s`, then the area of one face is `s * s`.
   - Thus, the lateral surface area is `4 * s * s`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `lateralsurface_cube` that takes one parameter `side_length`.
   - Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula `4 * side_length * side_length`.
   - Return the calculated lateral surface area.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def lateralsurface_cube(side_length: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the lateral surface area of the cube
    # Lateral surface area = 4 * (side length)^2
    lateral_surface_area = 4 * side_length * side_length
    
    # Return the calculated lateral surface area
    return lateral_surface_area
```

This function will correctly compute the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length, as required by the problem statement.

[Textbook Reference Material]:
    Chapter: Geometry
    Section: Polygon area
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Polygon area}

    A general formula for calculating the area
    of a polygon, sometimes called the \key{shoelace formula},
    is as follows: \index{shoelace formula}
    \[\frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (p_i \times p_{i+1})| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|, \]
    Here the vertices are
    $p_1=(x_1,y_1)$, $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$, $\ldots$, $p_n=(x_n,y_n)$
    in such an order that
    $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ are adjacent vertices on the boundary
    of the polygon,
    and the first and last vertex is the same, i.e., $p_1=p_n$.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is
    \[\frac{|(2\cdot5-5\cdot4)+(5\cdot3-7\cdot5)+(7\cdot1-4\cdot3)+(4\cdot3-4\cdot1)+(4\cdot4-2\cdot3)|}{2} = 17/2.\]

    The idea of the formula is to go through trapezoids
    whose one side is a side of the polygon,
    and another side lies on the horizontal line $y=0$.
    For example:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \path[draw,fill=lightgray] (5,5.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (7,0) -- (5,0) -- (5,5.4);
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \draw (0,0) -- (10,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    The area of such a trapezoid is
    \[(x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2},\]
    where the vertices of the polygon are $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$.
    If $x_{i+1}>x_{i}$, the area is positive,
    and if $x_{i+1}<x_{i}$, the area is negative.

    The area of the polygon is the sum of areas of
    all such trapezoids, which yields the formula
    \[|\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2}| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|.\]

    Note that the absolute value of the sum is taken,
    because the value of the sum may be positive or negative,
    depending on whether we walk clockwise or counterclockwise
    along the boundary of the polygon.

    \subsubsection{Pick's theorem}

    \index{Pick's theorem}

    \key{Pick's theorem} provides another way to calculate
    the area of a polygon provided that all vertices 
    of the polygon have integer coordinates.
    According to Pick's theorem, the area of the polygon is
    \[ a + b/2 -1,\]
    where $a$ is the number of integer points inside the polygon
    and $b$ is the number of integer points on the boundary of the polygon.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);

    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (3,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,4.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,2.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,2.4) circle (2pt);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is $6+7/2-1=17/2$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/266 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube when given the length of one of its sides.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The lateral surface area of a cube is the total area of all the sides except the top and bottom. A cube has 6 equal square faces, and the lateral surface area is the sum of the areas of the 4 vertical faces. Each face of the cube is a square with an area equal to the side length squared. Therefore, the lateral surface area is 4 times the area of one face.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   - Calculate the area of one face of the cube by squaring the side length.
   - Multiply the area of one face by 4 to get the lateral surface area.
   - Return the lateral surface area.
