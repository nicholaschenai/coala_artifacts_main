    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube when given the length of one of its sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The lateral surface area of a cube is the total area of all the sides except the top and bottom. A cube has 6 equal square faces, and the lateral surface area is the sum of the areas of the 4 vertical faces. Each face of the cube is a square with an area equal to the side length squared. Therefore, the lateral surface area is 4 times the area of one face.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   - Calculate the area of one face of the cube by squaring the side length.\n   - Multiply the area of one face by 4 to get the lateral surface area.\n   - Return the lateral surface area.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef lateralsurface_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of one face of the cube\n    face_area = side_length * side_length\n    \n    # Calculate the lateral surface area (4 faces)\n    lateral_surface_area = 4 * face_area\n    \n    # Return the lateral surface area\n    return lateral_surface_area\n```",
