    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces all spaces with underscores and all underscores with spaces.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we check if it is a space or an underscore. If it is a space, we replace it with an underscore. If it is an underscore, we replace it with a space. If it is neither, we leave it unchanged. We then construct a new string with these modified characters and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function replace_spaces(input_string):\n       initialize an empty string result\n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is a space:\n               append an underscore to result\n           else if character is an underscore:\n               append a space to result\n           else:\n               append the character to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef replace_spaces(input_string: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = ''\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # If the character is a space, replace it with an underscore\n        if char == ' ':\n            result += '_'\n        # If the character is an underscore, replace it with a space\n        elif char == '_':\n            result += ' '\n        # Otherwise, keep the character as it is\n        else:\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the modified string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly replace spaces with underscores and underscores with spaces in the given input string.",
