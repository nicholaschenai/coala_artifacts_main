INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/566 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the sum of its digits.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Convert the integer to a string to easily access each digit.
   - Iterate over each character in the string representation of the number.
   - Convert each character back to an integer.
   - Sum all these integer values.
   - Return the total sum.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_digits(n):
       convert n to a string
       initialize sum to 0
       for each character in the string:
           convert character to an integer
           add the integer to sum
       return sum
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_digits(n: int) -> int:
    # Convert the integer to a string to iterate over each digit
    str_n = str(n)
    
    # Initialize the sum of digits to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string representation of the number
    for char in str_n:
        # Convert the character back to an integer and add it to the total sum
        total_sum += int(char)
    
    # Return the total sum of the digits
    return total_sum
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character, converting each character back to an integer, and summing these integers.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/566 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the sum of its digits. For example, if the input is 345, the function should return 12 because 3 + 4 + 5 equals 12.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can convert the integer into a string to easily access each digit. Then, we iterate over each character in the string, convert it back to an integer, and add it to a running total. Finally, we return the total sum of the digits.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function sum_digits(n):
       convert n to a string
       initialize sum to 0
       for each character in the string:
           convert character to an integer
           add the integer to sum
       return sum
   ```
