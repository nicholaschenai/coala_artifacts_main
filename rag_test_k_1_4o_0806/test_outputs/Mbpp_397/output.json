    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the median of these numbers. The median is the middle value when the numbers are sorted in order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the median of three numbers, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, sort the three numbers in ascending order.\n   - The median will be the second number in this sorted list because it is the middle value.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function median_numbers(a, b, c):\n       - Create a list with the numbers [a, b, c]\n       - Sort the list in ascending order\n       - Return the second element of the sorted list as a float\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef median_numbers(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> float:\n    # Step 1: Create a list with the three numbers\n    numbers = [a, b, c]\n    \n    # Step 2: Sort the list in ascending order\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the second element of the sorted list as a float\n    return float(numbers[1])\n```",
