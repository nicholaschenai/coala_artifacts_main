INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/97 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input, flattens it into a single list, and then counts the frequency of each element in this flattened list. The result should be returned as a dictionary where the keys are the elements and the values are their respective frequencies.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, we need to flatten the list of lists into a single list. This means we take all the elements from each sublist and combine them into one list.
   - Next, we will create a dictionary to store the frequency of each element. We will iterate over the flattened list and for each element, we will either add it to the dictionary with a count of 1 (if it's not already there) or increment its count by 1 (if it is already there).
   - Finally, we will return the dictionary containing the frequencies of all elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function frequency_lists with parameter list_of_lists
       Initialize an empty list called flattened_list
       For each sublist in list_of_lists
           Extend flattened_list with elements from sublist
       Initialize an empty dictionary called frequency_dict
       For each element in flattened_list
           If element is not in frequency_dict
               Add element to frequency_dict with value 1
           Else
               Increment the value of element in frequency_dict by 1
       Return frequency_dict
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def frequency_lists(list_of_lists):
    # Initialize an empty list to store all elements from the sublists
    flattened_list = []
    
    # Flatten the list of lists into a single list
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        flattened_list.extend(sublist)
    
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element
    frequency_dict = {}
    
    # Count the frequency of each element in the flattened list
    for element in flattened_list:
        if element not in frequency_dict:
            # If the element is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
            frequency_dict[element] = 1
        else:
            # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count
            frequency_dict[element] += 1
    
    # Return the dictionary containing the frequencies
    return frequency_dict

    Title: Counting labeled graphs
    Part: 1/1
    # Counting labeled graphs

    ## Labeled graphs

    Let the number of vertices in a graph be $n$.
    We have to compute the number $G_n$ of labeled graphs with $n$ vertices (labeled means that the vertices are marked with the numbers from $1$ to $n$).
    The edges of the graphs are considered undirected, and loops and multiple edges are forbidden.

    We consider the set of all possible edges of the graph.
    For each edge $(i, j)$ we can assume that $i < j$ (because the graph is undirected, and there are no loops).
    Therefore the set of all edges has the cardinality $\binom{n}{2}$, i.e. $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

    Since any labeled graph is uniquely determined by its edges, the number of labeled graphs with $n$ vertices is equal to:

    $$G_n = 2^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$$

    ## Connected labeled graphs

    Here, we additionally impose the restriction that the graph has to be connected.

    Let's denote the required number of connected graphs with $n$ vertices as $C_n$.

    We will first discuss how many **disconnected** graphs exists.
    Then the number of connected graphs will be $G_n$ minus the number of disconnected graphs.
    Even more, we will count the number of **disconnected, rooted graphs**.A rooted graph is a graph, where we emphasize one vertex by labeling it as root.
    Obviously we have $n$ possibilities to root a graph with $n$ labeled vertices, therefore we will need to divide the number of disconnected rooted graphs by $n$ at the end to get the number of disconnected graphs.

    The root vertex will appear in a connected component of size $1, \dots n-1$.
    There are $k \binom{n}{k} C_k G_{n-k}$ graphs such that the root vertex is in a connected component with $k$ vertices (there are $\binom{n}{k}$ ways to choose $k$ vertices for the component, these are connected in one of $C_k$ ways, the root vertex can be any of the $k$ vertices, and the remainder $n-k$ vertices can be connected/disconnected in any way, which gives a factor of $G_{n-k}$).
    Therefore the number of disconnected graphs with $n$ vertices is:

    $$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k \binom{n}{k} C_k G_{n-k}$$

    And finally the number of connected graphs is:

    $$C_n = G_n - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k \binom{n}{k} C_k G_{n-k}$$

    ## Labeled graphs with $k$ connected components {data-toc-label="Labeled graphs with k connected components"}

    Based on the formula from the previous section, we will learn how to count the number of labeled graphs with $n$ vertices and $k$ connected components.

    This number can be computed using dynamic programming.
    We will compute $D[i][j]$ - the number of labeled graphs with $i$ vertices and $j$ components - for each $i \le n$ and $j \le k$.

    Let's discuss how to compute the next element $D[n][k]$ if we already know the previous values.
    We use a common approach, we take the last vertex (index $n$).
    This vertex belongs to some component.
    If the size of this component be $s$, then there are $\binom{n-1}{s-1}$ ways to choose such a set of vertices, and $C_s$ ways to connect them.After removing this component from the graph we have $n-s$ remaining vertices with $k-1$ connected components.
    Therefore we obtain the following recurrence relation:

    $$D[n][k] = \sum_{s=1}^{n} \binom{n-1}{s-1} C_s D[n-s][k-1]$$
