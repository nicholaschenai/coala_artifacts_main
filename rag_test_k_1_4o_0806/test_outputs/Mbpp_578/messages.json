The result should be a flat list where elements from the first, second, and third lists are interleaved.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate over the indices of the lists since they are all of the same length. For each index, we will take the element from the first list, then the element from the second list, and finally the element from the third list, and append them to a new list. This process will be repeated for all indices, resulting in an interleaved list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function interleave_lists(list1, list2, list3)\n       Initialize an empty list called interleaved_list\n       For each index i from 0 to the length of list1 (or list2 or list3) - 1\n           Append list1[i] to interleaved_list\n           Append list2[i] to interleaved_list\n           Append list3[i] to interleaved_list\n       Return interleaved_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef interleave_lists(list1, list2, list3):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the interleaved elements\n    interleaved_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Append the element from the first list at index i\n        interleaved_list.append(list1[i])\n        # Append the element from the second list at index i\n        interleaved_list.append(list2[i])\n        # Append the element from the third list at index i\n        interleaved_list.append(list3[i])\n    \n    # Return the interleaved list\n    return interleaved_list\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over the indices of the lists and appends elements from each list in turn to create the interleaved list. The function assumes that all input lists are of the same length, as specified in the problem statement."
