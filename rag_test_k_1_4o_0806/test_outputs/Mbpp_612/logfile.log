INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/612 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. The function should return a new list containing two lists: the first list should contain all the first elements from each sublist, and the second list should contain all the second elements from each sublist.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize two empty lists: one for storing the first elements of each sublist and another for storing the second elements.
2. Iterate over each sublist in the input list.
3. For each sublist, append the first element to the first list and the second element to the second list.
4. After processing all sublists, return a list containing the two lists.

## Pseudocode

```
function merge(list_of_lists):
    initialize first_elements as an empty list
    initialize second_elements as an empty list
    
    for each sublist in list_of_lists:
        append the first element of sublist to first_elements
        append the second element of sublist to second_elements
    
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def merge(list_of_lists):
    # Initialize two empty lists to store the first and second elements
    first_elements = []
    second_elements = []
    
    # Iterate over each sublist in the input list
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Append the first element of the sublist to first_elements
        first_elements.append(sublist[0])
        # Append the second element of the sublist to second_elements
        second_elements.append(sublist[1])
    
    # Return a list containing the two lists
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
```

    \index{meet in the middle}

    \key{Meet in the middle} is a technique
    where the search space is divided into
    two parts of about equal size.
    A separate search is performed
    for both of the parts,
    and finally the results of the searches are combined.

    The technique can be used
    if there is an efficient way to combine the
    results of the searches.
    In such a situation, the two searches may require less
    time than one large search.
    Typically, we can turn a factor of $2^n$
    into a factor of $2^{n/2}$ using the meet in the
    middle technique.

    As an example, consider a problem where
    we are given a list of $n$ numbers and
    a number $x$,
    and we want to find out if it is possible
    to choose some numbers from the list so that
    their sum is $x$.
    For example, given the list $[2,4,5,9]$ and $x=15$,
    we can choose the numbers $[2,4,9]$ to get $2+4+9=15$.
    However, if $x=10$ for the same list,
    it is not possible to form the sum.

    A simple algorithm to the problem is to
    go through all subsets of the elements and
    check if the sum of any of the subsets is $x$.
    The running time of such an algorithm is $O(2^n)$,
    because there are $2^n$ subsets.
    However, using the meet in the middle technique,
    we can achieve a more efficient $O(2^{n/2})$ time algorithm\footnote{This
    idea was introduced in 1974 by E. Horowitz and S. Sahni \cite{hor74}.}.
    Note that $O(2^n)$ and $O(2^{n/2})$ are different
    complexities because $2^{n/2}$ equals $\sqrt{2^n}$.

    The idea is to divide the list into
    two lists $A$ and $B$ such that both
    lists contain about half of the numbers.
    The first search generates all subsets
    of $A$ and stores their sums to a list $S_A$.
    Correspondingly, the second search creates
    a list $S_B$ from $B$.
    After this, it suffices to check if it is possible
    to choose one element from $S_A$ and another
    element from $S_B$ such that their sum is $x$.
    This is possible exactly when there is a way to
    form the sum $x$ using the numbers of the original list.

    For example, suppose that the list is $[2,4,5,9]$ and $x=15$.
    First, we divide the list into $A=[2,4]$ and $B=[5,9]$.
    After this, we create lists
    $S_A=[0,2,4,6]$ and $S_B=[0,5,9,14]$.
    In this case, the sum $x=15$ is possible to form,
    because $S_A$ contains the sum $6$,
    $S_B$ contains the sum $9$, and $6+9=15$.
    This corresponds to the solution $[2,4,9]$.

    We can implement the algorithm so that
    its time complexity is $O(2^{n/2})$.
    First, we generate \emph{sorted} lists $S_A$ and $S_B$,
    which can be done in $O(2^{n/2})$ time using a merge-like technique.
    After this, since the lists are sorted,
    we can check in $O(2^{n/2})$ time if
    the sum $x$ can be created from $S_A$ and $S_B$.
