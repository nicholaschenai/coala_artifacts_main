If the string contains 'z', the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and check if any of them is the letter 'z'. If we find 'z', we return `True`. If we finish checking all characters and don't find 'z', we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function text_match_wordz(input_string):\n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is 'z':\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef text_match_wordz(input_string: str) -> bool:\n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # Check if the current character is 'z'\n        if char == 'z':\n            # If 'z' is found, return True\n            return True\n    # If no 'z' is found after checking all characters, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis function will correctly identify if the input string contains the letter 'z' and return the appropriate boolean value."
