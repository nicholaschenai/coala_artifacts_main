The user can ask for analysis, code, or both.

## Instructions
When asked to output code,
- Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
- include exactly one block of code with the entire solution
- No outside libraries are allowed. 
- Builtins are allowed.
- If the task specifies a function name to be used, follow it strictly (be case sensitive!) and declare the that function last (helper functions are declared first).
- DO NOT write any assert statements / tests.

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters,

Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/454 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z'. If the string contains 'z', the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and check if any of them is the letter 'z'. If we find 'z', we return `True`. If we finish checking all characters and don't find 'z', we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function text_match_wordz(input_string):
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is 'z':
               return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_match_wordz(input_string: str) -> bool:
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the current character is 'z'
        if char == 'z':
            # If 'z' is found, return True
            return True
    # If no 'z' is found after checking all characters, return False
    return False
```

This function will correctly identify if the input string contains the letter 'z' and return the appropriate boolean value.

    \subsubsection{Using the Z-array}

    It is often a matter of taste whether to use
    string hashing or the Z-algorithm.
    Unlike hashing, the Z-algorithm always works
    and there is no risk for collisions.
    On the other hand, the Z-algorithm is more difficult
    to implement and some problems can only be solved
    using hashing.

    As an example, consider again
    the pattern matching problem,
    where our task is to find the occurrences
    of a pattern $p$ in a string $s
[/Textbook Reference Material]


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/454 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z'. If the string contains 'z', the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and check if any character is 'z'. If we find 'z', we return `True` immediately. If we finish checking all characters and do not find 'z', we return `False`.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function text_match_wordz(text):
       for each character in text:
           if character is 'z':
               return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**

```python
def text_match_wordz(text: str) -> bool:
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in text:
        # Check if the current character is 'z'
        if char == 'z':
            # If 'z' is found, return True
            return True
    # If the loop completes without finding 'z', return False
    return False
```

This function will correctly identify if the string contains the letter 'z' and return the appropriate boolean value.

INFO - raw_msg:
 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z'. If the string contains 'z', the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and check if any character is 'z'. If we find 'z', we return `True` immediately. If we finish checking all characters and do not find 'z', we return `False`.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function text_match_wordz(text):
       for each character in text:
           if character is 'z':
               return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**

```python
def text_match_wordz(text: str) -> bool:
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in text:
        # Check if the current character is 'z'
        if char == 'z':
            # If 'z' is found, return True
            return True
    # If the loop completes without finding 'z', return False
    return False
```

This function will correctly identify if the string contains the letter 'z' and return the appropriate boolean value.
