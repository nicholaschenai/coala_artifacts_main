INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/283 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and checks if the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. For example, in the number 1234, the digit '1' appears once, '2' appears once, '3' appears once, and '4' appears once. Since each digit appears a number of times that is less than or equal to the digit itself, the function should return `True`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Convert the integer to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
   - Create a dictionary to count the frequency of each digit.
   - Iterate over each digit in the string representation of the number.
   - For each digit, update its count in the dictionary.
   - After counting, iterate over the dictionary to check if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself.
   - If all digits satisfy this condition, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function validate(n):
       convert n to string and store in variable num_str
       create an empty dictionary called digit_count
       
       for each character in num_str:
           convert character to integer and store in digit
           if digit is not in digit_count:
               set digit_count[digit] to 0
           increment digit_count[digit] by 1
       
       for each digit in digit_count:
           if digit_count[digit] > digit:
               return False
       
       return True
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def validate(n: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the integer to a string to iterate over each digit
    num_str = str(n)
    
    # Create a dictionary to count the frequency of each digit
    digit_count = {}
    
    # Count the frequency of each digit
    for char in num_str:
        digit = int(char)
        if digit not in digit_count:
            digit_count[digit] = 0
        digit_count[digit] += 1
    
    # Check if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself
    for digit in digit_count:
        if digit_count[digit] > digit:
            return False
    
    # If all conditions are satisfied, return True
    return True
```

This solution iterates over the digits of the number, counts their occurrences, and checks if each digit's frequency is less than or equal to the digit itself. If all digits satisfy this condition, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }
