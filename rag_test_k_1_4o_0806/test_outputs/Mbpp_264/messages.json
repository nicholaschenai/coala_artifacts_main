        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that converts a dog's age in human years to a dog's age in dog years. The function should take an integer representing the dog's age in human years and return an integer representing the dog's age in dog years. We are given that when the dog's age in human years is 12, the dog's age in dog years should be 61.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the conversion rate from human years to dog years. We can use the given example to find this conversion rate. \n\n1. We know that 12 human years correspond to 61 dog years.\n2. We can calculate the conversion rate by dividing 61 by 12.\n3. Once we have the conversion rate, we can multiply any given human age by this rate to get the dog's age in dog years.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `dog_age` that takes an integer `human_years`.\n2. Calculate the conversion rate from human years to dog years using the given example: `conversion_rate = 61 / 12`.\n3. Calculate the dog's age in dog years by multiplying `human_years` by `conversion_rate`.\n4. Return the result as an integer.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef dog_age(human_years: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the conversion rate from human years to dog years\n    conversion_rate = 61 / 12\n    \n    # Calculate the dog's age in dog years\n    dog_years = human_years * conversion_rate\n    \n    # Return the dog's age in dog years as an integer\n    return int(dog_years)\n```"
