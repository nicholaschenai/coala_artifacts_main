INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/264 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that converts a dog's age in human years to a dog's age in dog years. The function should take an integer representing the dog's age in human years and return an integer representing the dog's age in dog years. We are given that when the dog's age in human years is 12, the dog's age in dog years should be 61.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine the conversion rate from human years to dog years. We can use the given example to find this conversion rate. 

1. We know that 12 human years correspond to 61 dog years.
2. We can calculate the conversion rate by dividing 61 by 12.
3. Once we have the conversion rate, we can multiply any given human age by this rate to get the dog's age in dog years.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `dog_age` that takes an integer `human_years`.
2. Calculate the conversion rate from human years to dog years using the given example: `conversion_rate = 61 / 12`.
3. Calculate the dog's age in dog years by multiplying `human_years` by `conversion_rate`.
4. Return the result as an integer.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def dog_age(human_years: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the conversion rate from human years to dog years
    conversion_rate = 61 / 12
    
    # Calculate the dog's age in dog years
    dog_years = human_years * conversion_rate
    
    # Return the dog's age in dog years as an integer
    return int(dog_years)
```

    Chapter: Probability
    Section: Calculation
    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{Probability}

    \index{probability}

    A \key{probability} is a real number between $0$ and $1$
    that indicates how probable an event is.
    If an event is certain to happen,
    its probability is 1,
    and if an event is impossible,
    its probability is 0.
    The probability of an event is denoted $P(\cdots)$
    where the three dots describe the event.

    For example, when throwing a dice,
    the outcome is an integer between $1$ and $6$,
    and the probability of each outcome is $1/6$.
    For example, we can calculate the following probabilities:

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item $P(\textrm{''the outcome is 4''})=1/6$
    \item $P(\textrm{''the outcome is not 6''})=5/6$
    \item $P(\textrm{''the outcome is even''})=1/2$
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Calculation}

    To calculate the probability of an event,
    we can either use combinatorics
    or simulate the process that generates the event.
    As an example, let us calculate the probability
    of drawing three cards with the same value
    from a shuffled deck of cards
    (for example, $\spadesuit 8$, $\clubsuit 8$ and $\diamondsuit 8$).

    \subsubsection*{Method 1}

    We can calculate the probability using the formula

    \[\frac{\textrm{number of desired outcomes}}{\textrm{total number of outcomes}}.\]

    In this problem, the desired outcomes are those
    in which the value of each card is the same.
    There are $13 {4 \choose 3}$ such outcomes,
    because there are $13$ possibilities for the
    value of the cards and ${4 \choose 3}$ ways to
    choose $3$ suits from $4$ possible suits.

    There are a total of ${52 \choose 3}$ outcomes,
    because we choose 3 cards from 52 cards.
    Thus, the probability of the event is

    \[\frac{13 {4 \choose 3}}{{52 \choose 3}} = \frac{1}{425}.\]

    \subsubsection*{Method 2}

    Another way to calculate the probability is
    to simulate the process that generates the event.
    In this example, we draw three cards, so the process
    consists of three steps.
    We require that each step of the process is successful.

    Drawing the first card certainly succeeds,
    because there are no restrictions.
    The second step succeeds with probability $3/51$,
    because there are 51 cards left and 3 of them
    have the same value as the first card.
    In a similar way, the third step succeeds with probability $2/50$.

    The probability that the entire process succeeds is

    \[1 \cdot \frac{3}{51} \cdot \frac{2}{50} = \frac{1}{425}.\]
