    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that converts a dog's age in human years to a dog's age in dog years. The function should take an integer representing the dog's age in human years and return an integer representing the dog's age in dog years. We are given that a 12-year-old dog is equivalent to 61 dog years.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to determine the conversion rate from human years to dog years. We know that 12 human years correspond to 61 dog years. We can calculate the conversion rate by dividing 61 by 12. Once we have the conversion rate, we can multiply any given human age by this rate to get the equivalent dog age.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named dog_age that takes an integer human_years as input.\n   Calculate the conversion rate by dividing 61 by 12.\n   Multiply the input human_years by the conversion rate to get the dog's age in dog years.\n   Return the calculated dog's age in dog years as an integer.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef dog_age(human_years: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the conversion rate from human years to dog years\n    conversion_rate = 61 / 12\n    \n    # Calculate the dog's age in dog years by multiplying the human years by the conversion rate\n    dog_years = human_years * conversion_rate\n    \n    # Return the dog's age in dog years as an integer\n    return int(dog_years)\n```",
