INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/628 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every space character in the string with the sequence '%20'. The function should return the modified string.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.
   - If the character is a space, we will append '%20' to a new string.
   - If the character is not a space, we will append the character itself to the new string.
   - Finally, we will return the new string which will have all spaces replaced by '%20'.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function replace_spaces(input_string):
       initialize an empty string called result
       for each character in input_string:
           if the character is a space:
               append '%20' to result
           else:
               append the character to result
       return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def replace_spaces(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to build the result
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # If the character is a space, append '%20' to the result
        if char == ' ':
            result += '%20'
        # Otherwise, append the character itself to the result
        else:
            result += char
    
    # Return the final result string with spaces replaced by '%20'
    return result
```

This solution iterates through the input string once, appending either '%20' or the character itself to the result string, ensuring that all spaces are replaced as required.

    Chapter: Introduction
    Section: Input and output
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Input and output}

    \index{input and output}

    In most contests, standard streams are used for
    reading input and writing output.
    In C++, the standard streams are
    \texttt{cin} for input and \texttt{cout} for output.
    In addition, the C functions
    \texttt{scanf} and \texttt{printf} can be used.

    The input for the program usually consists of
    numbers and strings that are separated with
    spaces and newlines.
    They can be read from the \texttt{cin} stream
    as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a, b;
    string x;
    cin >> a >> b >> x;
    \end{lstlisting}

    This kind of code always works,
    assuming that there is at least one space
    or newline between each element in the input.
    For example, the above code can read
    both of the following inputs:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    123 456 monkey
    \end{lstlisting}
    \begin{lstlisting}
    123    456
    monkey
    \end{lstlisting}
    The \texttt{cout} stream is used for output
    as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a = 123, b = 456;
    string x = "monkey";
    cout << a << " " << b << " " << x << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    Input and output is sometimes
    a bottleneck in the program.
    The following lines at the beginning of the code
    make input and output more efficient:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that the newline \texttt{"\textbackslash n"}
    works faster than \texttt{endl},
    because \texttt{endl} always causes
    a flush operation.

    The C functions \texttt{scanf}
    and \texttt{printf} are an alternative
    to the C++ standard streams.
    They are usually a bit faster,
    but they are also more difficult to use.
    The following code reads two integers from the input:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    \end{lstlisting}
    The following code prints two integers:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a = 123, b = 456;
    printf("%d %d\n", a, b);
    \end{lstlisting}

    Sometimes the program should read a whole line
    from the input, possibly containing spaces.
    This can be accomplished by using the
    \texttt{getline} function:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    string s;
    getline(cin, s);
    \end{lstlisting}

    If the amount of data is unknown, the following
    loop is useful:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    while (cin >> x) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    This loop reads elements from the input
    one after another, until there is no
    more data available in the input.

    In some contest systems, files are used for
    input and output.
    An easy solution for this is to write
    the code as usual using standard streams,
    but add the following lines to the beginning of the code:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this, the program reads the input from the file
    ''input.txt'' and writes the output to the file
    ''output.txt''.

   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every space character in the string with the sequence '%20'. The function should return the modified string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate over each character in the input string. If the character is a space, we replace it with '%20'. If it's not a space, we keep the character as it is. We can use Python's string method `replace` to achieve this efficiently, as it allows us to replace all occurrences of a substring with another substring in one call.
