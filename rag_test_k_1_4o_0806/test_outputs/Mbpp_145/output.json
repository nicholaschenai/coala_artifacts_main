    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array of integers. This means we need to identify the largest possible value that can be obtained by subtracting one element from another within the array.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, we can follow these steps:\n   - Identify the smallest and largest elements in the array.\n   - The maximum difference will be the difference between the largest and smallest elements.\n   - This is because the largest difference between any two numbers in a set is always between the maximum and minimum values.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_Abs_Diff(array):\n       if array is empty:\n           return 0\n       initialize min_value to the first element of the array\n       initialize max_value to the first element of the array\n       for each element in the array:\n           if element is less than min_value:\n               update min_value to element\n           if element is greater than max_value:\n               update max_value to element\n       return max_value - min_value\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_Abs_Diff(array):\n    # If the array is empty, return 0 as there are no elements to compare\n    if not array:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Initialize min_value and max_value to the first element of the array\n    min_value = array[0]\n    max_value = array[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the array\n    for element in array:\n        # Update min_value if the current element is smaller\n        if element < min_value:\n            min_value = element\n        # Update max_value if the current element is larger\n        if element > max_value:\n            max_value = element\n    \n    # The maximum difference is the difference between max_value and min_value\n    return max_value - min_value\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the maximum difference by iterating through the array once, making it O(n) in time complexity.",
