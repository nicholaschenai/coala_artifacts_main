INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/145 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array of integers. The array is provided as a tuple.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify the smallest and largest elements in the array.
   - The maximum difference will be the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

   This approach works because the maximum difference between any two numbers in a set is always the difference between the maximum and minimum numbers.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function max_Abs_Diff(arr):
       - Find the minimum value in the array and store it in min_value
       - Find the maximum value in the array and store it in max_value
       - Calculate the difference: max_value - min_value
       - Return the difference
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def max_Abs_Diff(arr: tuple) -> int:
    # Find the minimum value in the array
    min_value = min(arr)
    # Find the maximum value in the array
    max_value = max(arr)
    # Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values
    difference = max_value - min_value
    # Return the calculated difference
    return difference
```

This function will correctly compute the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by leveraging the built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the smallest and largest elements, respectively.

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 1/2
    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum

    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).

    ## Problem statement

    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:

    $$ \max_{ 1 \le l \le r \le n } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.
    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.

    ## Algorithm 1

    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm is very simple.

    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.

    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.

    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.

    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.

    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.

    ### Implementation

    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ â€” we will only need the current element from it.

    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.

    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);
        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);
    }
    ```

    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        int cur = sum - min_sum;
        if (cur > ans) {
            ans = cur;
            ans_l = min_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = sum;
            min_pos = r;
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Algorithm 2

    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.

    **Proof:**

    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum â€” so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.

    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.

    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a "critical" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.

    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.

    ### Implementation

    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum);
        sum = max(sum, 0);
    }
    ```

    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        if (sum > ans) {
            ans = sum;
            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < 0) {
            sum = 0;
            minus_pos = r;
        }
    }

       initialize min_value to the first element of the array
       initialize max_value to the first element of the array
       for each element in the array:
           if element is less than min_value:
               update min_value to element
           if element is greater than max_value:

    if not array:

    # Initialize min_value and max_value to the first element of the array
    min_value = array[0]
    max_value = array[0]
