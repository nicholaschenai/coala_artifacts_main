    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a month number (from 1 to 12) as input and returns `True` if that month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   We know that certain months have 31 days: January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. These correspond to the month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12. The function should check if the given month number is one of these and return `True` if it is, otherwise return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function check_monthnumb_number that takes an integer month_number as input\n       Create a set of month numbers that have 31 days: {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}\n       If month_number is in the set, return True\n       Otherwise, return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_monthnumb_number(month_number: int) -> bool:\n    # Set of month numbers that have 31 days\n    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}\n    \n    # Check if the given month number is in the set\n    return month_number in months_with_31_days\n```",
