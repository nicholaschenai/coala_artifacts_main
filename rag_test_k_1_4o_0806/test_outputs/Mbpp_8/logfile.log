INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/8 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is the square of the corresponding element in the input list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate over each element in the input list.
2. For each element, we will calculate its square.
3. We will store each squared value in a new list.
4. Finally, we will return the new list containing all the squared values.

## Pseudocode

```
function square_nums(nums):
    create an empty list called squared_list
    for each number in nums:
        calculate the square of the number
        append the squared value to squared_list
    return squared_list
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def square_nums(nums):
    # Create an empty list to store squared numbers
    squared_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # Calculate the square of the current number
        squared_value = num * num
        
        # Append the squared value to the squared_list
        squared_list.append(squared_value)
    
    # Return the list of squared numbers
    return squared_list
```
