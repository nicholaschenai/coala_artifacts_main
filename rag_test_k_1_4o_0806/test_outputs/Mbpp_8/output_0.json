Finally, we will return this new list containing the squared values.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named square_nums that takes a list of numbers as input.\n   Initialize an empty list to store squared numbers.\n   For each number in the input list:\n       Calculate the square of the number.\n       Append the squared number to the new list.\n   Return the new list containing squared numbers.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef square_nums(nums):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the squared numbers\n    squared_numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the input list\n    for num in nums:\n        # Calculate the square of the current number\n        square = num * num\n        # Append the squared number to the list\n        squared_numbers.append(square)\n    \n    # Return the list containing all squared numbers\n    return squared_numbers\n```",
