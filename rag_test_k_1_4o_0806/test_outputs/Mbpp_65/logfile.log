INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/65 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a nested list (a list that can contain other lists) and returns the sum of all the elements in the list, regardless of their level of nesting.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We need to iterate through each element in the list.
2. If an element is a list itself, we need to recursively call the function to handle this sublist.
3. If an element is an integer, we add it to a running total.
4. Continue this process until all elements have been processed.
5. Return the total sum of all elements.

## Pseudocode

```
function recursive_list_sum(lst):
    initialize total_sum to 0
    for each element in lst:
        if element is a list:
            add the result of recursive_list_sum(element) to total_sum
        else:
            add element to total_sum
    return total_sum
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def recursive_list_sum(lst):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for element in lst:
        # If the element is a list, recursively sum its elements
        if isinstance(element, list):
            total_sum += recursive_list_sum(element)
        else:
            # Otherwise, add the element directly to the total sum
            total_sum += element
    
    # Return the total sum of all elements
    return total_sum

    Title: Segment Tree
    Part: 1/10
    # Segment Tree

    A Segment Tree is a data structure that stores information about array intervals as a tree. This allows answering range queries over an array efficiently, while still being flexible enough to allow quick modification of the array.
    This includes finding the sum of consecutive array elements $a[l \dots r]$, or finding the minimum element in a such a range in $O(\log n)$ time. 
    Between answering such queries, the Segment Tree allows modifying the array by replacing one element, or even changing the elements of a whole subsegment (e.g. assigning all elements $a[l \dots r]$ to any value, or adding a value to all element in the subsegment). 

    In general, a Segment Tree is a very flexible data structure, and a huge number of problems can be solved with it. 
    Additionally, it is also possible to apply more complex operations and answer more complex queries (see [Advanced versions of Segment Trees](segment_tree.md#advanced-versions-of-segment-trees)).
    In particular the Segment Tree can be easily generalized to larger dimensions. 
    For instance, with a two-dimensional Segment Tree you can answer sum or minimum queries over some subrectangle of a given matrix in only $O(\log^2 n)$ time. 

    One important property of Segment Trees is that they require only a linear amount of memory.
    The standard Segment Tree requires $4n$ vertices for working on an array of size $n$. 

    ## Simplest form of a Segment Tree

    To start easy, we consider the simplest form of a Segment Tree. 
    We want to answer sum queries efficiently. 
    The formal definition of our task is:
    Given an array $a[0 \dots n-1]$, the Segment Tree must be able to find the sum of elements between the indices $l$ and $r$ (i.e. computing the sum $\sum_{i=l}^r a[i]$), and also handle changing values of the elements in the array (i.e. perform assignments of the form $a[i] = x$).
    The Segment Tree should be able to process **both** queries in $O(\log n)$ time.

    This is an improvement over the simpler approaches.
    A naive array implementation - just using a simple array - can update elements in $O(1)$, but requires $O(n)$ to compute each sum query.
    And precomputed prefix sums can compute sum queries in $O(1)$, but updating an array element requires $O(n)$ changes to the prefix sums.

    ### Structure of the Segment Tree

    We can take a divide-and-conquer approach when it comes to array segments. 
    We compute and store the sum of the elements of the whole array, i.e. the sum of the segment $a[0 \dots n-1]$. 
    We then split the array into two halves $a[0 \dots n/2-1]$ and $a[n/2 \dots n-1]$ and compute the sum of each halve and store them. 
    Each of these two halves in turn are split in half, and so on until all segments reach size $1$. 

    We can view these segments as forming a binary tree: 
    the root of this tree is the segment $a[0 \dots n-1]$, and each vertex (except leaf vertices) has exactly two child vertices. 
    This is why the data structure is called "Segment Tree", even though in most implementations the tree is not constructed explicitly (see [Implementation](segment_tree.md#implementation)).

    Here is a visual representation of such a Segment Tree over the array $a = [1, 3, -2, 8, -7]$:

    !["Sum Segment Tree"](sum-segment-tree.png)

    From this short description of the data structure, we can already conclude that a Segment Tree only requires a linear number of vertices. 
    The first level of the tree contains a single node (the root), the second level will contain two vertices, in the third it will contain four vertices, until the number of vertices reaches $n$. 
    Thus the number of vertices in the worst case can be estimated by the sum $1 + 2 + 4 + \dots + 2^{\lceil\log_2 n\rceil} \lt 2^{\lceil\log_2 n\rceil + 1} \lt 4n$.

    It is worth noting that whenever $n$ is not a power of two, not all levels of the Segment Tree will be completely filled. 
    We can see that behavior in the image.
    For now we can forget about this fact, but it will become important later during the implementation.

    The height of the Segment Tree is $O(\log n)$, because when going down from the root to the leaves the size of the segments decreases approximately by half. 

    ### Construction

    Before constructing the segment tree, we need to decide:

    1. the *value* that gets stored at each node of the segment tree.
       For example, in a sum segment tree, a node would store the sum of the elements in its range $[l, r]$.
    2. the *merge* operation that merges two siblings in a segment tree.
       For example, in a sum segment tree, the two nodes corresponding to the ranges $a[l_1 \dots r_1]$ and $a[l_2 \dots r_2]$ would be merged into a node corresponding to the range $a[l_1 \dots r_2]$ by adding the values of the two nodes.

    Note that a vertex is a "leaf vertex", if its corresponding segment covers only one value in the original array. It is present at the lowermost level of a segment tree. Its value would be equal to the (corresponding) element $a[i]$. 

    Now, for construction of the segment tree, we start at the bottom level (the leaf vertices) and assign them their respective values. On the basis of these values, we can compute the values of the previous level, using the `merge` function.
    And on the basis of those, we can compute the values of the previous, and repeat the procedure until we reach the root vertex. 

    It is convenient to describe this operation recursively in the other direction, i.e., from the root vertex to the leaf vertices. The construction procedure, if called on a non-leaf vertex, does the following:

    1. recursively construct the values of the two child vertices
    2. merge the computed values of these children.

    We start the construction at the root vertex, and hence, we are able to compute the entire segment tree.

    The time complexity of this construction is $O(n)$, assuming that the merge operation is constant time (the merge operation gets called $n$ times, which is equal to the number of internal nodes in the segment tree).

    ### Sum queries

    For now we are going to answer sum queries. As an input we receive two integers $l$ and $r$, and we have to compute the sum of the segment $a[l \dots r]$ in $O(\log n)$ time. 

    To do this, we will traverse the Segment Tree and use the precomputed sums of the segments.
    Let's assume that we are currently at the vertex that covers the segment $a[tl \dots tr]$.
    There are three possible cases. 

    The easiest case is when the segment $a[l \dots r]$ is equal to the corresponding segment of the current vertex (i.e. $a[l \dots r] = a[tl \dots tr]$), then we are finished and can return the precomputed sum that is stored in the vertex.

    Alternatively the segment of the query can fall completely into the domain of either the left or the right child.
    Recall that the left child covers the segment $a[tl \dots tm]$ and the right vertex covers the segment $a[tm + 1 \dots tr]$ with $tm = (tl + tr) / 2$. 
    In this case we can simply go to the child vertex, which corresponding segment covers the query segment, and execute the algorithm described here with that vertex. 

    And then there is the last case, the query segment intersects with both children. 
    In this case we have no other option as to make two recursive calls, one for each child.
    First we go to the left child, compute a partial answer for this vertex (i.e. the sum of values of the intersection between the segment of the query and the segment of the left child), then go to the right child, compute the partial answer using that vertex, and then combine the answers by adding them. 
    In other words, since the left child represents the segment $a[tl \dots tm]$ and the right child the segment $a[tm+1 \dots tr]$, we compute the sum query $a[l \dots tm]$ using the left child, and the sum query $a[tm+1 \dots r]$ using the right child.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/65 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a nested list (a list that can contain other lists) and returns the sum of all the numbers in it. The function should be able to handle lists that contain other lists at any level of nesting.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to traverse the list and its sublists recursively. For each element in the list:
   - If the element is a number, add it to a running total.
   - If the element is a list, recursively call the function on this sublist and add the result to the running total.
   - Continue this process until all elements have been processed, and return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function `recursive_list_sum` that takes a list `lst` as input.
   Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0.
   For each element `item` in `lst`:
       If `item` is a list:
           Add the result of `recursive_list_sum(item)` to `total_sum`.
       Else:
           Add `item` to `total_sum`.
   Return `total_sum`.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def recursive_list_sum(lst):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each item in the list
    for item in lst:

        if isinstance(item, list):

        else:
            total_sum += item
