Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain the sums of each pair of consecutive elements from the input tuple.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we will:\n- Iterate through the input tuple, stopping one element before the end.\n- For each element, add it to the next element in the tuple.\n- Store each sum in a new list.\n- Convert the list of sums into a tuple and return it.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction add_pairwise(input_tuple):\n    initialize an empty list called result\n    for each index i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:\n        calculate the sum of input_tuple[i] and input_tuple[i + 1]\n        append the sum to the result list\n    convert the result list to a tuple\n    return the result tuple\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef add_pairwise(input_tuple):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the sums\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the tuple, stopping before the last element\n    for i in range(len(input_tuple) - 1):\n        # Calculate the sum of the current element and the next element\n        pair_sum = input_tuple[i] + input_tuple[i + 1]\n        # Append the sum to the result list\n        result.append(pair_sum)\n    \n    # Convert the list of sums to a tuple\n    result_tuple = tuple(result)\n    \n    # Return the resulting tuple\n    return result_tuple\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the pairwise sums of neighboring elements in the input tuple and return them as a new tuple."
