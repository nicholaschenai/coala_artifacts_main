INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/470 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain the sums of each pair of consecutive elements from the input tuple.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we will:
- Iterate through the input tuple, stopping one element before the end.
- For each element, add it to the next element in the tuple.
- Store each sum in a new list.
- Convert the list of sums into a tuple and return it.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function add_pairwise(input_tuple):
    initialize an empty list called result
    for each index i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:
        calculate the sum of input_tuple[i] and input_tuple[i + 1]
        append the sum to the result list
    convert the result list to a tuple
    return the result tuple
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def add_pairwise(input_tuple):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sums
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the tuple, stopping before the last element
    for i in range(len(input_tuple) - 1):
        # Calculate the sum of the current element and the next element
        pair_sum = input_tuple[i] + input_tuple[i + 1]
        # Append the sum to the result list
        result.append(pair_sum)
    
    # Convert the list of sums to a tuple
    result_tuple = tuple(result)
    
    # Return the resulting tuple
    return result_tuple
```

This code will correctly compute the pairwise sums of neighboring elements in the input tuple and return them as a new tuple.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
