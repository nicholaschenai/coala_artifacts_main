    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the implementation of the `get_ludic` function to ensure it accurately identifies lucid numbers. The key change is to ensure that we check for divisibility by perfect squares only up to the current number being evaluated.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n):\n    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers\n    result = []\n    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        is_lucid = True\n        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1\n        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):\n            perfect_square = s * s\n            if i % perfect_square == 0:\n                is_lucid = False\n                break\n        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list\n        if is_lucid:\n            result.append(i)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code iterates through each number from 1 to `n`, checks for divisibility by perfect squares starting from 4 (2^2) up to the square root of the current number, and adds the number to the result list if it is not divisible by any of those perfect squares. This should now correctly return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer.",
