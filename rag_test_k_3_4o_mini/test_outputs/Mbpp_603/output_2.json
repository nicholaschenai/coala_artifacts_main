    "raw_msg": "Given the insights from the previous analysis, I will revise the implementation of the `get_ludic` function to ensure it correctly identifies lucid numbers. The key is to ensure that we check for divisibility by all perfect squares greater than 1, specifically starting from 4 (2^2) and going up to the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to the current number being evaluated.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n):\n    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers\n    result = []\n    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        is_lucid = True\n        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1\n        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):\n            perfect_square = s * s\n            if i % perfect_square == 0:\n                is_lucid = False\n                break\n        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list\n        if is_lucid:\n            result.append(i)\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Initialization**: We create an empty list `result` to store the lucid numbers.\n2. **Iteration**: We loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n`.\n3. **Perfect Square Check**: For each number `i`, we check if it is divisible by any perfect square starting from 4 (2^2) up to the largest perfect square less than or equal to `i`.\n4. **Adding to Result**: If `i` is not divisible by any perfect square, it is considered a lucid number and is added to the `result` list.\n5. **Return**: Finally, we return the list of lucid numbers.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer `n`.",
