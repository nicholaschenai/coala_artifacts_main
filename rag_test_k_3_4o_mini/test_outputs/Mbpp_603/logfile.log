INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that returns a list of all "lucid numbers" that are less than or equal to a specified integer. A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any prime number greater than itself.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find all lucid numbers up to a given integer, we can iterate through each number from 1 to the specified integer. For each number, we will check if it is divisible by any prime number that is less than itself. If it is not divisible by any such prime, we will consider it a lucid number and add it to our result list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function get_ludic(n):
       create an empty list called lucid_numbers
       for each number i from 1 to n:
           is_lucid = true
           for each prime p less than i:
               if i is divisible by p:
                   is_lucid = false
                   break
           if is_lucid:
               add i to lucid_numbers

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. 

    \subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \subsubsection{Euler's totient function}

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    Title: Linear Sieve
    Part: 1/1
    # Linear Sieve

    Given a number $n$, find all prime numbers in a segment $[2;n]$.

    The standard way of solving a task is to use [the sieve of Eratosthenes](sieve-of-eratosthenes.md). This algorithm is very simple, but it has runtime $O(n \log \log n)$.

    Although there are a lot of known algorithms with sublinear runtime (i.e. $o(n)$), the algorithm described below is interesting by its simplicity: it isn't any more complex than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes.

    Besides, the algorithm given here calculates **factorizations of all numbers** in the segment $[2; n]$ as a side effect, and that can be helpful in many practical applications.

    The weakness of the given algorithm is in using more memory than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes': it requires an array of $n$ numbers, while for the classic sieve of Eratosthenes it is enough to have $n$ bits of memory (which is 32 times less).

    Thus, it makes sense to use the described algorithm only until for numbers of order $10^7$ and not greater.

    The algorithm is due to Paul Pritchard. It is a variant of Algorithm 3.3 in (Pritchard, 1987: see references in the end of the article).

    ## Algorithm

    Our goal is to calculate **minimum prime factor** $lp [i]$ for every number $i$ in the segment $[2; n]$.

    Besides, we need to store the list of all the found prime numbers - let's call it $pr []$.

    We'll initialize the values $lp [i]$ with zeros, which means that we assume all numbers are prime. During the algorithm execution this array will be filled gradually.

    Now we'll go through the numbers from 2 to $n$. We have two cases for the current number $i$:

    - $lp[i] = 0$ - that means that $i$ is prime, i.e. we haven't found any smaller factors for it.  
      Hence, we assign $lp [i] = i$ and add $i$ to the end of the list $pr[]$.

    - $lp[i] \neq 0$ - that means that $i$ is composite, and its minimum prime factor is $lp [i]$.

    In both cases we update values of $lp []$ for the numbers that are divisible by $i$. However, our goal is to learn to do so as to set a value $lp []$ at most once for every number. We can do it as follows:

    Let's consider numbers $x_j = i \cdot p_j$, where $p_j$ are all prime numbers less than or equal to $lp [i]$ (this is why we need to store the list of all prime numbers).

    We'll set a new value $lp [x_j] = p_j$ for all numbers of this form.

    The proof of correctness of this algorithm and its runtime can be found after the implementation.

    ## Implementation

    ```cpp
    const int N = 10000000;
    vector<int> lp(N+1);
    vector<int> pr;
 
    for (int i=2; i <= N; ++i) {
    	if (lp[i] == 0) {
    		lp[i] = i;
    		pr.push_back(i);
    	}
    	for (int j = 0; i * pr[j] <= N; ++j) {
    		lp[i * pr[j]] = pr[j];
    		if (pr[j] == lp[i]) {
    			break;
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

    ## Correctness Proof

    We need to prove that the algorithm sets all values $lp []$ correctly, and that every value will be set exactly once. Hence, the algorithm will have linear runtime, since all the remaining actions of the algorithm, obviously, work for $O (n)$.

    Notice that every number $i$ has exactly one representation in form:

    $$i = lp [i] \cdot x,$$

    where $lp [i]$ is the minimal prime factor of $i$, and the number $x$ doesn't have any prime factors less than $lp [i]$, i.e.

    $$lp [i] \le lp [x].$$

    Now, let's compare this with the actions of our algorithm: in fact, for every $x$ it goes through all prime numbers it could be multiplied by, i.e. all prime numbers up to $lp [x]$ inclusive, in order to get the numbers in the form given above.

    Hence, the algorithm will go through every composite number exactly once, setting the correct values $lp []$ there. Q.E.D.

    ## Runtime and Memory

    Although the running time of $O(n)$ is better than $O(n \log \log n)$ of the classic sieve of Eratosthenes, the difference between them is not so big.
    In practice the linear sieve runs about as fast as a typical implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes.

    In comparison to optimized versions of the sieve of Erathosthenes, e.g. the segmented sieve, it is much slower.

    Considering the memory requirements of this algorithm - an array $lp []$ of length $n$, and an array of $pr []$ of length  $\frac n {\ln n}$, this algorithm seems to worse than the classic sieve in every way.

    However, its redeeming quality is that this algorithm calculates an array $lp []$, which allows us to find factorization of any number in the segment $[2; n]$ in the time of the size order of this factorization. Moreover, using just one extra array will allow us to avoid divisions when looking for factorization.

    Knowing the factorizations of all numbers is very useful for some tasks, and this algorithm is one of the few which allow to find them in linear time.

If a number is not divisible by any of these perfect squares, it is considered a lucid number and should be added to the result list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding Lucid Numbers**: A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. This means that if a number can be divided evenly by 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), etc., it is not a lucid number.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: In the previous implementation, I checked for divisibility by perfect squares starting from 4 and going up to the square of the integer square root of `n`. However, I did not correctly handle the condition for perfect squares. Specifically, I should have only considered perfect squares that are less than or equal to the current number `i`.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The loop that checks for divisibility by perfect squares was not correctly structured. I should have checked all perfect squares starting from 4 up to `i`, not just up to `n`. This means I need to adjust the inner loop to ensure that it only checks perfect squares that are relevant to the current number being evaluated.

4. **Correcting the Logic**: I will modify the inner loop to iterate through perfect squares starting from 2 (to get 4) and check each perfect square until it exceeds the current number `i`. If any perfect square divides `i`, it should be marked as not lucid.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def is_perfect_square(num):
    # Check if a number is a perfect square
    return int(num**0.5) ** 2 == num

def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        is_lucid = True
        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if perfect_square > i:
                break
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False
                break
        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
``` 

This code should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the given integer `n`.

        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. 

    \subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \subsubsection{Euler's totient function}

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [generation text] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the implementation of the `get_ludic` function to ensure it accurately identifies lucid numbers. The key change is to ensure that we check for divisibility by perfect squares only up to the current number being evaluated.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []

        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False

        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:

    return result
```

This code iterates through each number from 1 to `n`, checks for divisibility by perfect squares starting from 4 (2^2) up to the square root of the current number, and adds the number to the result list if it is not divisible by any of those perfect squares. This should now correctly return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer.

A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find all lucid numbers up to a given integer `n`, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` and check if each number is divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 (like 4, 9, 16, etc.).

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding Lucid Numbers**: A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. This means that if a number can be divided evenly by 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), etc., it is not a lucid number.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: In the previous implementation, I checked for divisibility by perfect squares starting from 4 and going up to the square of the integer square root of `n`. However, I did not correctly handle the condition for perfect squares. Specifically, I should have only considered perfect squares that are less than or equal to the current number `i`.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The loop that checks for divisibility by perfect squares was not correctly structured. I should have checked all perfect squares starting from 4 up to `i`, not just up to `n`. This means I need to adjust the inner loop to ensure that it only checks perfect squares that are relevant to the current number being evaluated.

4. **Correcting the Logic**: I will modify the inner loop to iterate through perfect squares starting from 2 (to get 4) and check each perfect square until it exceeds the current number `i`. If any perfect square divides `i`, it should be marked as not lucid.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def is_perfect_square(num):
    # Check if a number is a perfect square
    return int(num**0.5) ** 2 == num

def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        is_lucid = True
        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if perfect_square > i:
                break
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False
                break
        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
``` 

This code should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the given integer `n`.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that returns all "lucid numbers" that are less than or equal to a given integer. A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find all lucid numbers up to a given integer `n`, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` and check if each number is divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 (like 4, 9, 16, etc.). If a number is not divisible by any of these perfect squares, it is considered a lucid number and should be added to the result list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function get_ludic(n):
       create an empty list called result
       for each number i from 1 to n:
           is_lucid = true
           for each perfect square s starting from 4 (2^2) up to n:
               if i is divisible by s:
                   is_lucid = false
                   break
           if is_lucid:
               add i to result
       return result
   ```

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding Lucid Numbers**: A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. This means that if a number can be divided evenly by 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), etc., it is not a lucid number.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: In the previous implementation, I checked for divisibility by perfect squares starting from 4 and going up to the square of the integer square root of `n`. However, I did not correctly handle the condition for perfect squares. Specifically, I should have only considered perfect squares that are less than or equal to the current number `i`.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The loop that checks for divisibility by perfect squares was not correctly structured. I should have checked all perfect squares starting from 4 up to `i`, not just up to `n`. This means I need to adjust the inner loop to ensure that it only checks perfect squares that are relevant to the current number being evaluated.

4. **Correcting the Logic**: I will modify the inner loop to iterate through perfect squares starting from 2 (to get 4) and check each perfect square until it exceeds the current number `i`. If any perfect square divides `i`, it should be marked as not lucid.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def is_perfect_square(num):
    # Check if a number is a perfect square
    return int(num**0.5) ** 2 == num

def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        is_lucid = True
        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if perfect_square > i:
                break
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False
                break
        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
``` 

This code should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the given integer `n`.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the implementation of the `get_ludic` function to ensure it accurately identifies lucid numbers. The key change is to ensure that we check for divisibility by perfect squares only up to the current number being evaluated.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        is_lucid = True
        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False
                break
        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```

This code iterates through each number from 1 to `n`, checks for divisibility by perfect squares starting from 4 (2^2) up to the square root of the current number, and adds the number to the result list if it is not divisible by any of those perfect squares. This should now correctly return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer.

4. **Correcting the Logic**: I need to ensure that I check all perfect squares starting from 4 up to the current number `i`. This means I should iterate through all integers starting from 2 and calculate their squares until the square exceeds `i`.

    Title: Linear Sieve
    Part: 1/1
    # Linear Sieve

    Given a number $n$, find all prime numbers in a segment $[2;n]$.

    The standard way of solving a task is to use [the sieve of Eratosthenes](sieve-of-eratosthenes.md). This algorithm is very simple, but it has runtime $O(n \log \log n)$.

    Although there are a lot of known algorithms with sublinear runtime (i.e. $o(n)$), the algorithm described below is interesting by its simplicity: it isn't any more complex than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes.

    Besides, the algorithm given here calculates **factorizations of all numbers** in the segment $[2; n]$ as a side effect, and that can be helpful in many practical applications.

    The weakness of the given algorithm is in using more memory than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes': it requires an array of $n$ numbers, while for the classic sieve of Eratosthenes it is enough to have $n$ bits of memory (which is 32 times less).

    Thus, it makes sense to use the described algorithm only until for numbers of order $10^7$ and not greater.

    The algorithm is due to Paul Pritchard. It is a variant of Algorithm 3.3 in (Pritchard, 1987: see references in the end of the article).

    ## Algorithm

    Our goal is to calculate **minimum prime factor** $lp [i]$ for every number $i$ in the segment $[2; n]$.

    Besides, we need to store the list of all the found prime numbers - let's call it $pr []$.

    We'll initialize the values $lp [i]$ with zeros, which means that we assume all numbers are prime. During the algorithm execution this array will be filled gradually.

    Now we'll go through the numbers from 2 to $n$. We have two cases for the current number $i$:

    - $lp[i] = 0$ - that means that $i$ is prime, i.e. we haven't found any smaller factors for it.  
      Hence, we assign $lp [i] = i$ and add $i$ to the end of the list $pr[]$.

    - $lp[i] \neq 0$ - that means that $i$ is composite, and its minimum prime factor is $lp [i]$.

    In both cases we update values of $lp []$ for the numbers that are divisible by $i$. However, our goal is to learn to do so as to set a value $lp []$ at most once for every number. We can do it as follows:

    Let's consider numbers $x_j = i \cdot p_j$, where $p_j$ are all prime numbers less than or equal to $lp [i]$ (this is why we need to store the list of all prime numbers).

    We'll set a new value $lp [x_j] = p_j$ for all numbers of this form.

    The proof of correctness of this algorithm and its runtime can be found after the implementation.

    ## Implementation

    ```cpp
    const int N = 10000000;
    vector<int> lp(N+1);
    vector<int> pr;
 
    for (int i=2; i <= N; ++i) {
    	if (lp[i] == 0) {
    		lp[i] = i;
    		pr.push_back(i);
    	}
    	for (int j = 0; i * pr[j] <= N; ++j) {
    		lp[i * pr[j]] = pr[j];
    		if (pr[j] == lp[i]) {
    			break;
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

    ## Correctness Proof

    We need to prove that the algorithm sets all values $lp []$ correctly, and that every value will be set exactly once. Hence, the algorithm will have linear runtime, since all the remaining actions of the algorithm, obviously, work for $O (n)$.

    Notice that every number $i$ has exactly one representation in form:

    $$i = lp [i] \cdot x,$$

    where $lp [i]$ is the minimal prime factor of $i$, and the number $x$ doesn't have any prime factors less than $lp [i]$, i.e.

    $$lp [i] \le lp [x].$$

    Now, let's compare this with the actions of our algorithm: in fact, for every $x$ it goes through all prime numbers it could be multiplied by, i.e. all prime numbers up to $lp [x]$ inclusive, in order to get the numbers in the form given above.

    Hence, the algorithm will go through every composite number exactly once, setting the correct values $lp []$ there. Q.E.D.

    ## Runtime and Memory

    Although the running time of $O(n)$ is better than $O(n \log \log n)$ of the classic sieve of Eratosthenes, the difference between them is not so big.
    In practice the linear sieve runs about as fast as a typical implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes.

    In comparison to optimized versions of the sieve of Erathosthenes, e.g. the segmented sieve, it is much slower.

    Considering the memory requirements of this algorithm - an array $lp []$ of length $n$, and an array of $pr []$ of length  $\frac n {\ln n}$, this algorithm seems to worse than the classic sieve in every way.

    However, its redeeming quality is that this algorithm calculates an array $lp []$, which allows us to find factorization of any number in the segment $[2; n]$ in the time of the size order of this factorization. Moreover, using just one extra array will allow us to avoid divisions when looking for factorization.

    Knowing the factorizations of all numbers is very useful for some tasks, and this algorithm is one of the few which allow to find them in linear time.

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$.

    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [generation text] Given the insights from the previous analysis, I will revise the implementation of the `get_ludic` function to ensure it correctly identifies lucid numbers. The key is to ensure that we check for divisibility by all perfect squares greater than 1, specifically starting from 4 (2^2) and going up to the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to the current number being evaluated.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):

        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False
                break
        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: We create an empty list `result` to store the lucid numbers.
2. **Iteration**: We loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n`.
3. **Perfect Square Check**: For each number `i`, we check if it is divisible by any perfect square starting from 4 (2^2) up to the largest perfect square less than or equal to `i`.
4. **Adding to Result**: If `i` is not divisible by any perfect square, it is considered a lucid number and is added to the `result` list.
5. **Return**: Finally, we return the list of lucid numbers.

This implementation should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer `n`.

        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: We create an empty list `result` to store the lucid numbers.
2. **Iteration**: We loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n`.
3. **Perfect Square Check**: For each number `i`, we check if it is divisible by any perfect square starting from 4 (2^2) up to the largest perfect square less than or equal to `i`.
4. **Adding to Result**: If `i` is not divisible by any perfect square, it is considered a lucid number and is added to the `result` list.
5. **Return**: Finally, we return the list of lucid numbers.

This implementation should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer `n`.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding Lucid Numbers**: A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. This means that if a number can be divided evenly by 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), etc., it is not a lucid number.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: In the previous implementation, I checked for divisibility by perfect squares starting from 4 and going up to the square of the integer square root of `n`. However, I did not correctly handle the condition for perfect squares. Specifically, I should have only considered perfect squares that are less than or equal to the current number `i`.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The loop that checks for divisibility by perfect squares was not correctly structured. I should have checked all perfect squares starting from 4 up to `i`, not just up to `n`. This means I need to adjust the inner loop to ensure that it only checks perfect squares that are relevant to the current number being evaluated.

4. **Correcting the Logic**: I will modify the inner loop to iterate through perfect squares starting from 2 (to get 4) and check each perfect square until it exceeds the current number `i`. If any perfect square divides `i`, it should be marked as not lucid.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def is_perfect_square(num):
    # Check if a number is a perfect square
    return int(num**0.5) ** 2 == num

def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        is_lucid = True
        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if perfect_square > i:
                break
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False
                break
        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
``` 

This code should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the given integer `n`.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the implementation of the `get_ludic` function to ensure it accurately identifies lucid numbers. The key change is to ensure that we check for divisibility by perfect squares only up to the current number being evaluated.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        is_lucid = True
        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False
                break
        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```

This code iterates through each number from 1 to `n`, checks for divisibility by perfect squares starting from 4 (2^2) up to the square root of the current number, and adds the number to the result list if it is not divisible by any of those perfect squares. This should now correctly return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: The current implementation is incorrectly identifying some numbers as lucid when they should not be. Specifically, it seems to be allowing numbers that are divisible by perfect squares (like 4, 9, etc.) to be included in the result.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The logic for checking divisibility by perfect squares is correct in terms of iterating through potential perfect squares, but I need to ensure that I am correctly identifying all perfect squares greater than 1. The perfect squares to check should start from 4 (2^2) and go up to the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to `i`.

4. **Correcting the Logic**: I need to ensure that I check all perfect squares starting from 4 up to the current number `i`. This means I should iterate through all integers starting from 2 and calculate their squares until the square exceeds `i`.

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding Lucid Numbers**: A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. This means that if a number can be divided evenly by 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), etc., it is not a lucid number.

2. **Identifying the Issue**: In the previous implementation, I checked for divisibility by perfect squares starting from 4 and going up to the square of the integer square root of `n`. However, I did not correctly handle the condition for perfect squares. Specifically, I should have only considered perfect squares that are less than or equal to the current number `i`.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The loop that checks for divisibility by perfect squares was not correctly structured. I should have checked all perfect squares starting from 4 up to `i`, not just up to `n`. This means I need to adjust the inner loop to ensure that it only checks perfect squares that are relevant to the current number being evaluated.

4. **Correcting the Logic**: I will modify the inner loop to iterate through perfect squares starting from 2 (to get 4) and check each perfect square until it exceeds the current number `i`. If any perfect square divides `i`, it should be marked as not lucid.

Now, let's implement the corrected solution:

```python
def is_perfect_square(num):
    # Check if a number is a perfect square
    return int(num**0.5) ** 2 == num

def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        is_lucid = True
        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if perfect_square > i:
                break
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False
                break
        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
``` 

This code should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the given integer `n`.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the implementation of the `get_ludic` function to ensure it accurately identifies lucid numbers. The key change is to ensure that we check for divisibility by perfect squares only up to the current number being evaluated.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        is_lucid = True
        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False
                break
        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```

This code iterates through each number from 1 to `n`, checks for divisibility by perfect squares starting from 4 (2^2) up to the square root of the current number, and adds the number to the result list if it is not divisible by any of those perfect squares. This should now correctly return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer.

3. **Perfect Square Check**: For each number `i`, we check if it is divisible by any perfect square starting from 4 (2^2) up to the largest perfect square less than or equal to `i`.
4. **Adding to Result**: If `i` is not divisible by any perfect square, it is considered a lucid number and is added to the `result` list.
5. **Return**: Finally, we return the list of lucid numbers.

This implementation should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer `n`.

    Title: Linear Sieve
    Part: 1/1
    # Linear Sieve

    Given a number $n$, find all prime numbers in a segment $[2;n]$.

    The standard way of solving a task is to use [the sieve of Eratosthenes](sieve-of-eratosthenes.md). This algorithm is very simple, but it has runtime $O(n \log \log n)$.

    Although there are a lot of known algorithms with sublinear runtime (i.e. $o(n)$), the algorithm described below is interesting by its simplicity: it isn't any more complex than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes.

    Besides, the algorithm given here calculates **factorizations of all numbers** in the segment $[2; n]$ as a side effect, and that can be helpful in many practical applications.

    The weakness of the given algorithm is in using more memory than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes': it requires an array of $n$ numbers, while for the classic sieve of Eratosthenes it is enough to have $n$ bits of memory (which is 32 times less).

    Thus, it makes sense to use the described algorithm only until for numbers of order $10^7$ and not greater.

    The algorithm is due to Paul Pritchard. It is a variant of Algorithm 3.3 in (Pritchard, 1987: see references in the end of the article).

    ## Algorithm

    Our goal is to calculate **minimum prime factor** $lp [i]$ for every number $i$ in the segment $[2; n]$.

    Besides, we need to store the list of all the found prime numbers - let's call it $pr []$.

    We'll initialize the values $lp [i]$ with zeros, which means that we assume all numbers are prime. During the algorithm execution this array will be filled gradually.

    Now we'll go through the numbers from 2 to $n$. We have two cases for the current number $i$:

    - $lp[i] = 0$ - that means that $i$ is prime, i.e. we haven't found any smaller factors for it.  
      Hence, we assign $lp [i] = i$ and add $i$ to the end of the list $pr[]$.

    - $lp[i] \neq 0$ - that means that $i$ is composite, and its minimum prime factor is $lp [i]$.

    In both cases we update values of $lp []$ for the numbers that are divisible by $i$. However, our goal is to learn to do so as to set a value $lp []$ at most once for every number. We can do it as follows:

    Let's consider numbers $x_j = i \cdot p_j$, where $p_j$ are all prime numbers less than or equal to $lp [i]$ (this is why we need to store the list of all prime numbers).

    We'll set a new value $lp [x_j] = p_j$ for all numbers of this form.

    The proof of correctness of this algorithm and its runtime can be found after the implementation.

    ## Implementation

    ```cpp
    const int N = 10000000;
    vector<int> lp(N+1);
    vector<int> pr;
 
    for (int i=2; i <= N; ++i) {
    	if (lp[i] == 0) {
    		lp[i] = i;
    		pr.push_back(i);
    	}
    	for (int j = 0; i * pr[j] <= N; ++j) {
    		lp[i * pr[j]] = pr[j];
    		if (pr[j] == lp[i]) {
    			break;
    		}
    	}
    }
    ```

    ## Correctness Proof

    We need to prove that the algorithm sets all values $lp []$ correctly, and that every value will be set exactly once. Hence, the algorithm will have linear runtime, since all the remaining actions of the algorithm, obviously, work for $O (n)$.

    Notice that every number $i$ has exactly one representation in form:

    $$i = lp [i] \cdot x,$$

    where $lp [i]$ is the minimal prime factor of $i$, and the number $x$ doesn't have any prime factors less than $lp [i]$, i.e.

    $$lp [i] \le lp [x].$$

    Now, let's compare this with the actions of our algorithm: in fact, for every $x$ it goes through all prime numbers it could be multiplied by, i.e. all prime numbers up to $lp [x]$ inclusive, in order to get the numbers in the form given above.

    Hence, the algorithm will go through every composite number exactly once, setting the correct values $lp []$ there. Q.E.D.

    ## Runtime and Memory

    Although the running time of $O(n)$ is better than $O(n \log \log n)$ of the classic sieve of Eratosthenes, the difference between them is not so big.
    In practice the linear sieve runs about as fast as a typical implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes.

    In comparison to optimized versions of the sieve of Erathosthenes, e.g. the segmented sieve, it is much slower.

    Considering the memory requirements of this algorithm - an array $lp []$ of length $n$, and an array of $pr []$ of length  $\frac n {\ln n}$, this algorithm seems to worse than the classic sieve in every way.

    However, its redeeming quality is that this algorithm calculates an array $lp []$, which allows us to find factorization of any number in the segment $[2; n]$ in the time of the size order of this factorization. Moreover, using just one extra array will allow us to avoid divisions when looking for factorization.

    Knowing the factorizations of all numbers is very useful for some tasks, and this algorithm is one of the few which allow to find them in linear time.

        if (sieve[x]) continue;

        }

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/603 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem again and identify the correct approach to find all lucid numbers less than or equal to a given integer `n`.

### Understanding the Requirements
A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. This means we need to check for divisibility by perfect squares like 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), etc.

### Identifying the Issue
The previous implementations did not correctly filter out numbers that are divisible by perfect squares. Specifically, the logic for checking divisibility was not comprehensive enough to ensure that all relevant perfect squares were considered.

### Correcting the Logic
1. We need to iterate through each number from 1 to `n`.
2. For each number, we will check divisibility against all perfect squares starting from 4 (2^2) up to the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to that number.
3. If a number is found to be divisible by any of these perfect squares, it should not be included in the result.

### Implementation
Here is the corrected implementation of the `get_ludic` function:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        is_lucid = True
        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if perfect_square > i:
                break
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False
                break
        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: We create an empty list `result` to store the lucid numbers.
2. **Iteration**: We loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n`.
3. **Perfect Square Check**: For each number `i`, we check if it is divisible by any perfect square starting from 4 (2^2) up to the largest perfect square less than or equal to `i`.
4. **Adding to Result**: If `i` is not divisible by any perfect square, it is considered a lucid number and is added to the `result` list.
5. **Return**: Finally, we return the list of lucid numbers.

This implementation should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer `n`.

 Let's analyze the problem again and identify the correct approach to find all lucid numbers less than or equal to a given integer `n`.

### Understanding the Requirements
A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. This means we need to check for divisibility by perfect squares like 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), etc.

### Identifying the Issue
The previous implementations did not correctly filter out numbers that are divisible by perfect squares. Specifically, the logic for checking divisibility was not comprehensive enough to ensure that all relevant perfect squares were considered.

### Correcting the Logic
1. We need to iterate through each number from 1 to `n`.
2. For each number, we will check divisibility against all perfect squares starting from 4 (2^2) up to the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to that number.
3. If a number is found to be divisible by any of these perfect squares, it should not be included in the result.

### Implementation
Here is the corrected implementation of the `get_ludic` function:

```python
def get_ludic(n):
    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers
    result = []
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        is_lucid = True
        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1
        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):
            perfect_square = s * s
            if perfect_square > i:
                break
            if i % perfect_square == 0:
                is_lucid = False
                break
        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list
        if is_lucid:
            result.append(i)
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: We create an empty list `result` to store the lucid numbers.
2. **Iteration**: We loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n`.
3. **Perfect Square Check**: For each number `i`, we check if it is divisible by any perfect square starting from 4 (2^2) up to the largest perfect square less than or equal to `i`.
4. **Adding to Result**: If `i` is not divisible by any perfect square, it is considered a lucid number and is added to the `result` list.
5. **Return**: Finally, we return the list of lucid numbers.

This implementation should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer `n`.
