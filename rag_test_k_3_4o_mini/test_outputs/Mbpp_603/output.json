    "raw_msg": "Let's analyze the problem again and identify the correct approach to find all lucid numbers less than or equal to a given integer `n`.\n\n### Understanding the Requirements\nA lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. This means we need to check for divisibility by perfect squares like 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), etc.\n\n### Identifying the Issue\nThe previous implementations did not correctly filter out numbers that are divisible by perfect squares. Specifically, the logic for checking divisibility was not comprehensive enough to ensure that all relevant perfect squares were considered.\n\n### Correcting the Logic\n1. We need to iterate through each number from 1 to `n`.\n2. For each number, we will check divisibility against all perfect squares starting from 4 (2^2) up to the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to that number.\n3. If a number is found to be divisible by any of these perfect squares, it should not be included in the result.\n\n### Implementation\nHere is the corrected implementation of the `get_ludic` function:\n\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n):\n    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers\n    result = []\n    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        is_lucid = True\n        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1\n        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):\n            perfect_square = s * s\n            if perfect_square > i:\n                break\n            if i % perfect_square == 0:\n                is_lucid = False\n                break\n        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list\n        if is_lucid:\n            result.append(i)\n    return result\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Initialization**: We create an empty list `result` to store the lucid numbers.\n2. **Iteration**: We loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n`.\n3. **Perfect Square Check**: For each number `i`, we check if it is divisible by any perfect square starting from 4 (2^2) up to the largest perfect square less than or equal to `i`.\n4. **Adding to Result**: If `i` is not divisible by any perfect square, it is considered a lucid number and is added to the `result` list.\n5. **Return**: Finally, we return the list of lucid numbers.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the specified integer `n`.",
