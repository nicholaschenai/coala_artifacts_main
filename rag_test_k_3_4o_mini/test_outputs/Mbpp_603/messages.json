This algorithm is very simple, but it has runtime $O(n \\log \\log n)$.\n\n    Although there are a lot of known algorithms with sublinear runtime (i.e. $o(n)$), the algorithm described below is interesting by its simplicity: it isn't any more complex than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes.\n\n    Besides, the algorithm given here calculates **factorizations of all numbers** in the segment $[2; n]$ as a side effect, and that can be helpful in many practical applications.\n\n    The weakness of the given algorithm is in using more memory than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes': it requires an array of $n$ numbers, while for the classic sieve of Eratosthenes it is enough to have $n$ bits of memory (which is 32 times less).\n\n    Thus, it makes sense to use the described algorithm only until for numbers of order $10^7$ and not greater.\n\n    The algorithm is due to Paul Pritchard. It is a variant of Algorithm 3.3 in (Pritchard, 1987: see references in the end of the article).\n\n    ## Algorithm\n\n    Our goal is to calculate **minimum prime factor** $lp [i]$ for every number $i$ in the segment $[2; n]$.\n\n    Besides, we need to store the list of all the found prime numbers - let's call it $pr []$.\n\n    We'll initialize the values $lp [i]$ with zeros, which means that we assume all numbers are prime. During the algorithm execution this array will be filled gradually.\n\n    Now we'll go through the numbers from 2 to $n$. We have two cases for the current number $i$:\n\n    - $lp[i] = 0$ - that means that $i$ is prime, i.e. we haven't found any smaller factors for it.  \n      Hence, we assign $lp [i] = i$ and add $i$ to the end of the list $pr[]$.\n\n    - $lp[i] \\neq 0$ - that means that $i$ is composite, and its minimum prime factor is $lp [i]$.\n\n    In both cases we update values of $lp []$ for the numbers that are divisible by $i$. However, our goal is to learn to do so as to set a value $lp []$ at most once for every number. We can do it as follows:\n\n    Let's consider numbers $x_j = i \\cdot p_j$, where $p_j$ are all prime numbers less than or equal to $lp [i]$ (this is why we need to store the list of all prime numbers).\n\n    We'll set a new value $lp [x_j] = p_j$ for all numbers of this form.\n\n    The proof of correctness of this algorithm and its runtime can be found after the implementation.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n    const int N = 10000000;\n    vector<int> lp(N+1);\n    vector<int> pr;\n \n    for (int i=2; i <= N; ++i) {\n    \tif (lp[i] == 0) {\n    \t\tlp[i] = i;\n    \t\tpr.push_back(i);\n    \t}\n    \tfor (int j = 0; i * pr[j] <= N; ++j) {\n    \t\tlp[i * pr[j]] = pr[j];\n    \t\tif (pr[j] == lp[i]) {\n    \t\t\tbreak;\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Correctness Proof\n\n    We need to prove that the algorithm sets all values $lp []$ correctly, and that every value will be set exactly once. Hence, the algorithm will have linear runtime, since all the remaining actions of the algorithm, obviously, work for $O (n)$.\n\n    Notice that every number $i$ has exactly one representation in form:\n\n    $$i = lp [i] \\cdot x,$$\n\n    where $lp [i]$ is the minimal prime factor of $i$, and the number $x$ doesn't have any prime factors less than $lp [i]$, i.e.\n\n    $$lp [i] \\le lp [x].$$\n\n    Now, let's compare this with the actions of our algorithm: in fact, for every $x$ it goes through all prime numbers it could be multiplied by, i.e. all prime numbers up to $lp [x]$ inclusive, in order to get the numbers in the form given above.\n\n    Hence, the algorithm will go through every composite number exactly once, setting the correct values $lp []$ there. Q.E.D.\n\n    ## Runtime and Memory\n\n    Although the running time of $O(n)$ is better than $O(n \\log \\log n)$ of the classic sieve of Eratosthenes, the difference between them is not so big.\n    In practice the linear sieve runs about as fast as a typical implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes.\n\n    In comparison to optimized versions of the sieve of Erathosthenes, e.g. the segmented sieve, it is much slower.\n\n    Considering the memory requirements of this algorithm - an array $lp []$ of length $n$, and an array of $pr []$ of length  $\\frac n {\\ln n}$, this algorithm seems to worse than the classic sieve in every way.\n\n    However, its redeeming quality is that this algorithm calculates an array $lp []$, which allows us to find factorization of any number in the segment $[2; n]$ in the time of the size order of this factorization. Moreover, using just one extra array will allow us to avoid divisions when looking for factorization.\n\n    Knowing the factorizations of all numbers is very useful for some tasks, and this algorithm is one of the few which allow to find them in linear time.\n\n    ## References\n\n    - Paul Pritchard, **Linear Prime-Number Sieves: a Family Tree**, Science of Computer Programming, vol. 9 (1987), pp.17-35.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

This means that if a number can be divided evenly by 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), etc., it is not a lucid number.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: In the previous implementation, I checked for divisibility by perfect squares starting from 4 and going up to the square of the integer square root of `n`. However, I did not correctly handle the condition for perfect squares. Specifically, I should have only considered perfect squares that are less than or equal to the current number `i`.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The loop that checks for divisibility by perfect squares was not correctly structured. I should have checked all perfect squares starting from 4 up to `i`, not just up to `n`. This means I need to adjust the inner loop to ensure that it only checks perfect squares that are relevant to the current number being evaluated.\n\n4. **Correcting the Logic**: I will modify the inner loop to iterate through perfect squares starting from 2 (to get 4) and check each perfect square until it exceeds the current number `i`. If any perfect square divides `i`, it should be marked as not lucid.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(num):\n    # Check if a number is a perfect square\n    return int(num**0.5) ** 2 == num\n\ndef get_ludic(n):\n    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers\n    result = []\n    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        is_lucid = True\n        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1\n        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):\n            perfect_square = s * s\n            if perfect_square > i:\n                break\n            if i % perfect_square == 0:\n                is_lucid = False\n                break\n        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list\n        if is_lucid:\n            result.append(i)\n    return result\n``` \n\nThis code should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the given integer `n`."

This algorithm is very simple, but it has runtime $O(n \\log \\log n)$.\n\n    Although there are a lot of known algorithms with sublinear runtime (i.e. $o(n)$), the algorithm described below is interesting by its simplicity: it isn't any more complex than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes.\n\n    Besides, the algorithm given here calculates **factorizations of all numbers** in the segment $[2; n]$ as a side effect, and that can be helpful in many practical applications.\n\n    The weakness of the given algorithm is in using more memory than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes': it requires an array of $n$ numbers, while for the classic sieve of Eratosthenes it is enough to have $n$ bits of memory (which is 32 times less).\n\n    Thus, it makes sense to use the described algorithm only until for numbers of order $10^7$ and not greater.\n\n    The algorithm is due to Paul Pritchard. It is a variant of Algorithm 3.3 in (Pritchard, 1987: see references in the end of the article).\n\n    ## Algorithm\n\n    Our goal is to calculate **minimum prime factor** $lp [i]$ for every number $i$ in the segment $[2; n]$.\n\n    Besides, we need to store the list of all the found prime numbers - let's call it $pr []$.\n\n    We'll initialize the values $lp [i]$ with zeros, which means that we assume all numbers are prime. During the algorithm execution this array will be filled gradually.\n\n    Now we'll go through the numbers from 2 to $n$. We have two cases for the current number $i$:\n\n    - $lp[i] = 0$ - that means that $i$ is prime, i.e. we haven't found any smaller factors for it.  \n      Hence, we assign $lp [i] = i$ and add $i$ to the end of the list $pr[]$.\n\n    - $lp[i] \\neq 0$ - that means that $i$ is composite, and its minimum prime factor is $lp [i]$.\n\n    In both cases we update values of $lp []$ for the numbers that are divisible by $i$. However, our goal is to learn to do so as to set a value $lp []$ at most once for every number. We can do it as follows:\n\n    Let's consider numbers $x_j = i \\cdot p_j$, where $p_j$ are all prime numbers less than or equal to $lp [i]$ (this is why we need to store the list of all prime numbers).\n\n    We'll set a new value $lp [x_j] = p_j$ for all numbers of this form.\n\n    The proof of correctness of this algorithm and its runtime can be found after the implementation.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n    const int N = 10000000;\n    vector<int> lp(N+1);\n    vector<int> pr;\n \n    for (int i=2; i <= N; ++i) {\n    \tif (lp[i] == 0) {\n    \t\tlp[i] = i;\n    \t\tpr.push_back(i);\n    \t}\n    \tfor (int j = 0; i * pr[j] <= N; ++j) {\n    \t\tlp[i * pr[j]] = pr[j];\n    \t\tif (pr[j] == lp[i]) {\n    \t\t\tbreak;\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Correctness Proof\n\n    We need to prove that the algorithm sets all values $lp []$ correctly, and that every value will be set exactly once. Hence, the algorithm will have linear runtime, since all the remaining actions of the algorithm, obviously, work for $O (n)$.\n\n    Notice that every number $i$ has exactly one representation in form:\n\n    $$i = lp [i] \\cdot x,$$\n\n    where $lp [i]$ is the minimal prime factor of $i$, and the number $x$ doesn't have any prime factors less than $lp [i]$, i.e.\n\n    $$lp [i] \\le lp [x].$$\n\n    Now, let's compare this with the actions of our algorithm: in fact, for every $x$ it goes through all prime numbers it could be multiplied by, i.e. all prime numbers up to $lp [x]$ inclusive, in order to get the numbers in the form given above.\n\n    Hence, the algorithm will go through every composite number exactly once, setting the correct values $lp []$ there. Q.E.D.\n\n    ## Runtime and Memory\n\n    Although the running time of $O(n)$ is better than $O(n \\log \\log n)$ of the classic sieve of Eratosthenes, the difference between them is not so big.\n    In practice the linear sieve runs about as fast as a typical implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes.\n\n    In comparison to optimized versions of the sieve of Erathosthenes, e.g. the segmented sieve, it is much slower.\n\n    Considering the memory requirements of this algorithm - an array $lp []$ of length $n$, and an array of $pr []$ of length  $\\frac n {\\ln n}$, this algorithm seems to worse than the classic sieve in every way.\n\n    However, its redeeming quality is that this algorithm calculates an array $lp []$, which allows us to find factorization of any number in the segment $[2; n]$ in the time of the size order of this factorization. Moreover, using just one extra array will allow us to avoid divisions when looking for factorization.\n\n    Knowing the factorizations of all numbers is very useful for some tasks, and this algorithm is one of the few which allow to find them in linear time.\n\n    ## References\n\n    - Paul Pritchard, **Linear Prime-Number Sieves: a Family Tree**, Science of Computer Programming, vol. 9 (1987), pp.17-35.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Number theory\n    Section: Primes and factors\n    Part: 2/2\n    $};\n    \\node at (13.5,1.5) {$15$};\n    \\node at (14.5,1.5) {$16$};\n    \\node at (15.5,1.5) {$17$};\n    \\node at (16.5,1.5) {$18$};\n    \\node at (17.5,1.5) {$19$};\n    \\node at (18.5,1.5) {$20$};\n\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    The following code implements the sieve of\n    Eratosthenes.\n    The code assumes that each element of\n    \\texttt{sieve} is initially zero.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {\n        if (sieve[x]) continue;\n        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {\n            sieve[u] = x;\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed\n    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.\n    Thus, an upper bound for the running time\n    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum\n    \\[\\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \\cdots + n/n = O(n \\log n).\\]\n\n    \\index{harmonic sum}\n\n    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,\n    because the inner loop will be executed only if\n    the number $x$ is prime.\n    It can be shown that the running time of the\n    algorithm is only $O(n \\log \\log n)$,\n    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. \n\n    \\subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}\n\n    \\index{greatest common divisor}\n    \\index{least common multiple}\n    \\index{Euclid's algorithm}\n\n    The \\key{greatest common divisor} of\n    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\\gcd(a,b)$,\n    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,\n    and the \\key{least common multiple} of\n    $a$ and $b$, $\\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,\n    is the smallest number that is divisible by\n    both $a$ and $b$.\n    For example,\n    $\\gcd(24,36)=12$ and\n    $\\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.\n\n    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple\n    are connected as follows:\n    \\[\\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{ab}{\\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\\]\n\n    \\key{Euclid's algorithm}\\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who\n    lived in about 300 BC.

A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: The current implementation is incorrectly identifying some numbers as lucid when they should not be. Specifically, it seems to be allowing numbers that are divisible by perfect squares (like 4, 9, etc.) to be included in the result.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The logic for checking divisibility by perfect squares is correct in terms of iterating through potential perfect squares, but I need to ensure that I am correctly identifying all perfect squares greater than 1. The perfect squares to check should start from 4 (2^2) and go up to the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to `i`.\n\n4. **Correcting the Logic**: I need to ensure that I check all perfect squares starting from 4 up to the current number `i`. This means I should iterate through all integers starting from 2 and calculate their squares until the square exceeds `i`.\n\n5. **Identifying the Mistake**: The mistake in the previous code is that it does not correctly handle the case where `i` is divisible by perfect squares. The check should ensure that if `i` is divisible by any perfect square greater than 1, it should not be included in the result.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n):\n    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers\n    result = []\n    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        is_lucid = True\n        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1\n        for s in range(2, int(i**0.5) + 1):\n            perfect_square = s * s\n            if i % perfect_square == 0:\n                is_lucid = False\n                break\n        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list\n        if is_lucid:\n            result.append(i)\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly identify and return all lucid numbers up to the given integer `n`. The key change is ensuring that we check for divisibility by all relevant perfect squares."

This algorithm is very simple, but it has runtime $O(n \\log \\log n)$.\n\n    Although there are a lot of known algorithms with sublinear runtime (i.e. $o(n)$), the algorithm described below is interesting by its simplicity: it isn't any more complex than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes.\n\n    Besides, the algorithm given here calculates **factorizations of all numbers** in the segment $[2; n]$ as a side effect, and that can be helpful in many practical applications.\n\n    The weakness of the given algorithm is in using more memory than the classic sieve of Eratosthenes': it requires an array of $n$ numbers, while for the classic sieve of Eratosthenes it is enough to have $n$ bits of memory (which is 32 times less).\n\n    Thus, it makes sense to use the described algorithm only until for numbers of order $10^7$ and not greater.\n\n    The algorithm is due to Paul Pritchard. It is a variant of Algorithm 3.3 in (Pritchard, 1987: see references in the end of the article).\n\n    ## Algorithm\n\n    Our goal is to calculate **minimum prime factor** $lp [i]$ for every number $i$ in the segment $[2; n]$.\n\n    Besides, we need to store the list of all the found prime numbers - let's call it $pr []$.\n\n    We'll initialize the values $lp [i]$ with zeros, which means that we assume all numbers are prime. During the algorithm execution this array will be filled gradually.\n\n    Now we'll go through the numbers from 2 to $n$. We have two cases for the current number $i$:\n\n    - $lp[i] = 0$ - that means that $i$ is prime, i.e. we haven't found any smaller factors for it.  \n      Hence, we assign $lp [i] = i$ and add $i$ to the end of the list $pr[]$.\n\n    - $lp[i] \\neq 0$ - that means that $i$ is composite, and its minimum prime factor is $lp [i]$.\n\n    In both cases we update values of $lp []$ for the numbers that are divisible by $i$. However, our goal is to learn to do so as to set a value $lp []$ at most once for every number. We can do it as follows:\n\n    Let's consider numbers $x_j = i \\cdot p_j$, where $p_j$ are all prime numbers less than or equal to $lp [i]$ (this is why we need to store the list of all prime numbers).\n\n    We'll set a new value $lp [x_j] = p_j$ for all numbers of this form.\n\n    The proof of correctness of this algorithm and its runtime can be found after the implementation.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n    const int N = 10000000;\n    vector<int> lp(N+1);\n    vector<int> pr;\n \n    for (int i=2; i <= N; ++i) {\n    \tif (lp[i] == 0) {\n    \t\tlp[i] = i;\n    \t\tpr.push_back(i);\n    \t}\n    \tfor (int j = 0; i * pr[j] <= N; ++j) {\n    \t\tlp[i * pr[j]] = pr[j];\n    \t\tif (pr[j] == lp[i]) {\n    \t\t\tbreak;\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Correctness Proof\n\n    We need to prove that the algorithm sets all values $lp []$ correctly, and that every value will be set exactly once. Hence, the algorithm will have linear runtime, since all the remaining actions of the algorithm, obviously, work for $O (n)$.\n\n    Notice that every number $i$ has exactly one representation in form:\n\n    $$i = lp [i] \\cdot x,$$\n\n    where $lp [i]$ is the minimal prime factor of $i$, and the number $x$ doesn't have any prime factors less than $lp [i]$, i.e.\n\n    $$lp [i] \\le lp [x].$$\n\n    Now, let's compare this with the actions of our algorithm: in fact, for every $x$ it goes through all prime numbers it could be multiplied by, i.e. all prime numbers up to $lp [x]$ inclusive, in order to get the numbers in the form given above.\n\n    Hence, the algorithm will go through every composite number exactly once, setting the correct values $lp []$ there. Q.E.D.\n\n    ## Runtime and Memory\n\n    Although the running time of $O(n)$ is better than $O(n \\log \\log n)$ of the classic sieve of Eratosthenes, the difference between them is not so big.\n    In practice the linear sieve runs about as fast as a typical implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes.\n\n    In comparison to optimized versions of the sieve of Erathosthenes, e.g. the segmented sieve, it is much slower.\n\n    Considering the memory requirements of this algorithm - an array $lp []$ of length $n$, and an array of $pr []$ of length  $\\frac n {\\ln n}$, this algorithm seems to worse than the classic sieve in every way.\n\n    However, its redeeming quality is that this algorithm calculates an array $lp []$, which allows us to find factorization of any number in the segment $[2; n]$ in the time of the size order of this factorization. Moreover, using just one extra array will allow us to avoid divisions when looking for factorization.\n\n    Knowing the factorizations of all numbers is very useful for some tasks, and this algorithm is one of the few which allow to find them in linear time.\n\n    ## References\n\n    - Paul Pritchard, **Linear Prime-Number Sieves: a Family Tree**, Science of Computer Programming, vol. 9 (1987), pp.17-35.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Number theory\n    Section: Primes and factors\n    Part: 2/2\n    $};\n    \\node at (13.5,1.5) {$15$};\n    \\node at (14.5,1.5) {$16$};\n    \\node at (15.5,1.5) {$17$};\n    \\node at (16.5,1.5) {$18$};\n    \\node at (17.5,1.5) {$19$};\n    \\node at (18.5,1.5) {$20$};\n\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    The following code implements the sieve of\n    Eratosthenes.\n    The code assumes that each element of\n    \\texttt{sieve} is initially zero.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {\n        if (sieve[x]) continue;\n        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {\n            sieve[u] = x;\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed\n    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.\n    Thus, an upper bound for the running time\n    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum\n    \\[\\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \\cdots + n/n = O(n \\log n).\\]\n\n    \\index{harmonic sum}\n\n    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,\n    because the inner loop will be executed only if\n    the number $x$ is prime.\n    It can be shown that the running time of the\n    algorithm is only $O(n \\log \\log n)$,\n    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. \n\n    \\subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}\n\n    \\index{greatest common divisor}\n    \\index{least common multiple}\n    \\index{Euclid's algorithm}\n\n    The \\key{greatest common divisor} of\n    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\\gcd(a,b)$,\n    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,\n    and the \\key{least common multiple} of\n    $a$ and $b$, $\\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,\n    is the smallest number that is divisible by\n    both $a$ and $b$.\n    For example,\n    $\\gcd(24,36)=12$ and\n    $\\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.\n\n    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple\n    are connected as follows:\n    \\[\\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{ab}{\\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\\]\n\n    \\key{Euclid's algorithm}\\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who\n    lived in about 300 BC.

This means we need to check for divisibility by perfect squares like 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), etc.\n\n### Identifying the Issue\nThe previous implementations did not correctly filter out numbers that are divisible by perfect squares. Specifically, the logic for checking divisibility was not comprehensive enough to ensure that all relevant perfect squares were considered.\n\n### Correcting the Logic\n1. We need to iterate through each number from 1 to `n`.\n2. For each number, we will check divisibility against all perfect squares starting from 4 (2^2) up to the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to that number.\n3.
