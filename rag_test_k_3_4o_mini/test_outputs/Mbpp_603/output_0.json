    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that returns all \"lucid numbers\" that are less than or equal to a given integer. A lucid number is defined as a positive integer that is not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find all lucid numbers up to a given integer `n`, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` and check if each number is divisible by any perfect square greater than 1 (like 4, 9, 16, etc.). If a number is not divisible by any of these perfect squares, it is considered a lucid number and should be added to the result list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function get_ludic(n):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for each number i from 1 to n:\n           is_lucid = true\n           for each perfect square s starting from 4 (2^2) up to n:\n               if i is divisible by s:\n                   is_lucid = false\n                   break\n           if is_lucid:\n               add i to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(num):\n    # Check if a number is a perfect square\n    return int(num**0.5) ** 2 == num\n\ndef get_ludic(n):\n    # Create a list to hold the lucid numbers\n    result = []\n    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        is_lucid = True\n        # Check for divisibility by perfect squares greater than 1\n        for s in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            perfect_square = s * s\n            if perfect_square > i:\n                break\n            if i % perfect_square == 0:\n                is_lucid = False\n                break\n        # If the number is lucid, add it to the result list\n        if is_lucid:\n            result.append(i)\n    return result\n```",
