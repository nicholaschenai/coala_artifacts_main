    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a Python function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its width and height. The area of a rectangle is determined by multiplying its width by its height.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To find the area of a rectangle, we need to take two inputs: the width and the height. The area can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\text{Width} \\times \\text{Height}\n   \\]\n   We will create a function that takes these two parameters and returns the calculated area.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION rectangle_area(width, height):\n       area = width * height\n       RETURN area\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef rectangle_area(width: int, height: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of the rectangle\n    area = width * height\n    # Return the calculated area\n    return area\n```",
