INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/458 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its width and height. The area is found by multiplying these two dimensions together.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the area of a rectangle, we will take two inputs: the width and the height. We will then multiply these two values to get the area. Finally, we will return the calculated area.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION rectangle_area(width, height):
       SET area = width * height
       RETURN area
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the area of a rectangle
def rectangle_area(width: int, height: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the area by multiplying width and height
    area = width * height
    # Return the calculated area
    return area

    Chapter: Geometry
    Section: Polygon area
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Polygon area}

    A general formula for calculating the area
    of a polygon, sometimes called the \key{shoelace formula},
    is as follows: \index{shoelace formula}
    \[\frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (p_i \times p_{i+1})| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|, \]
    Here the vertices are
    $p_1=(x_1,y_1)$, $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$, $\ldots$, $p_n=(x_n,y_n)$
    in such an order that
    $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ are adjacent vertices on the boundary
    of the polygon,
    and the first and last vertex is the same, i.e., $p_1=p_n$.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is
    \[\frac{|(2\cdot5-5\cdot4)+(5\cdot3-7\cdot5)+(7\cdot1-4\cdot3)+(4\cdot3-4\cdot1)+(4\cdot4-2\cdot3)|}{2} = 17/2.\]

    The idea of the formula is to go through trapezoids
    whose one side is a side of the polygon,
    and another side lies on the horizontal line $y=0$.
    For example:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \path[draw,fill=lightgray] (5,5.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (7,0) -- (5,0) -- (5,5.4);
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \draw (0,0) -- (10,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    The area of such a trapezoid is
    \[(x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2},\]
    where the vertices of the polygon are $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$.
    If $x_{i+1}>x_{i}$, the area is positive,
    and if $x_{i+1}<x_{i}$, the area is negative.

    The area of the polygon is the sum of areas of
    all such trapezoids, which yields the formula
    \[|\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2}| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|.\]

    Note that the absolute value of the sum is taken,
    because the value of the sum may be positive or negative,
    depending on whether we walk clockwise or counterclockwise
    along the boundary of the polygon.

    \subsubsection{Pick's theorem}

    \index{Pick's theorem}

    \key{Pick's theorem} provides another way to calculate
    the area of a polygon provided that all vertices 
    of the polygon have integer coordinates.
    According to Pick's theorem, the area of the polygon is
    \[ a + b/2 -1,\]
    where $a$ is the number of integer points inside the polygon
    and $b$ is the number of integer points on the boundary of the polygon.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);

    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (3,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,4.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,2.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,2.4) circle (2pt);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is $6+7/2-1=17/2$.

    \chapter{Matrices}

    \index{matrix}

    A \key{matrix} is a mathematical concept
    that corresponds to a two-dimensional array
    in programming. For example,
    \[
    A = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 13 & 7 & 4 \\
      7 & 0 & 8 & 2 \\
      9 & 5 & 4 & 18 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]
    is a matrix of size $3 \times 4$, i.e.,
    it has 3 rows and 4 columns.
    The notation $[i,j]$ refers to
    the element in row $i$ and column $j$
    in a matrix.
    For example, in the above matrix,
    $A[2,3]=8$ and $A[3,1]=9$.

    \index{vector}

    A special case of a matrix is a \key{vector}
    that is a one-dimensional matrix of size $n \times 1$.
    For example,
    \[
    V =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    4 \\
    7 \\
    5 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
    is a vector that contains three elements.

    \index{transpose}

    The \key{transpose} $A^T$ of a matrix $A$
    is obtained when the rows and columns of $A$
    are swapped, i.e., $A^T[i,j]=A[j,i]$:
    \[
    A^T = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 7 & 9 \\
      13 & 0 & 5 \\
      7 & 8 & 4 \\
      4 & 2 & 18 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]

    \index{square matrix}

    A matrix is a \key{square matrix} if it
    has the same number of rows and columns.
    For example, the following matrix is a
    square matrix:

    \[
    S = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
      3 & 12 & 4  \\
      5 & 9 & 15  \\
      0 & 2 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]

    \section{Operations}

    The sum $A+B$ of matrices $A$ and $B$
    is defined if the matrices are of the same size.
    The result is a matrix where each element
    is the sum of the corresponding elements
    in $A$ and $B$.

    For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 & 2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    +
     \begin{bmatrix}
      4 & 9 & 3 \\
      8 & 1 & 3 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6+4 & 1+9 & 4+3 \\
      3+8 & 9+1 & 2+3 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      10 & 10 & 7 \\
      11 & 10 & 5 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    Multiplying a matrix $A$ by a value $x$ means
    that each element of $A$ is multiplied by $x$.
    For example,
    \[
     2 \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 & 2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 \cdot 6 & 2\cdot1 & 2\cdot4 \\
      2\cdot3 & 2\cdot9 & 2\cdot2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      12 & 2 & 8 \\
      6 & 18 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    \subsubsection{Matrix multiplication}

    \index{matrix multiplication}

    The product $AB$ of matrices $A$ and $B$
    is defined if $A$ is of size $a \times n$
    and $B$ is of size $n \times b$, i.e.,
    the width of $A$ equals the height of $B$.
    The result is a matrix of size $a \times b$
    whose elements are calculated using the formula
    \[
    AB[i,j] = \sum_{k=1}^n A[i,k] \cdot B[k,j].
    \]

    The idea is that each element of $AB$
    is a sum of products of elements of $A$ and $B$
    according to the following picture:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,3);
    \draw (5,0) grid (10,3);
    \draw (5,4) grid (10,8);

    \node at (2,-1) {$A$};
    \node at (7.5,-1) {$AB$};
    \node at (11,6) {$B$};

    \draw[thick,->,red,line width=2pt] (0,1.5) -- (4,1.5);
    \draw[thick,->,red,line width=2pt] (6.5,8) -- (6.5,4);
    \draw[thick,red,line width=2pt] (6.5,1.5) circle (0.4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    For example,

    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 6 \\
      2 & 9 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 2 & 1 \cdot 6 + 4 \cdot 9 \\
      3 \cdot 1 + 9 \cdot 2 & 3 \cdot 6 + 9 \cdot 9 \\
      8 \cdot 1 + 6 \cdot 2 & 8 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 9 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      9 & 42 \\
      21 & 99 \\
      20 & 102 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    Matrix multiplication is associative,
    so $A(BC)=(AB)C$ holds,
    but it is not commutative,
    so $AB = BA$ does not usually hold.

    \index{identity matrix}

    An \key{identity matrix} is a square matrix
    where each element on the diagonal is 1
    and all other elements are 0.
    For example, the following matrix
    is the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix:
    \[
     I = \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]

    \begin{samepage}
    Multiplying a matrix by an identity matrix
    does not change it. For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix} \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px}
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]
    \end{samepage}

    Using a straightforward algorithm,
    we can calculate the product of
    two $n \times n$ matrices
    in $O(n^3)$ time.
    There are also more efficient algorithms
    for matrix multiplication\footnote{The first such
    algorithm was Strassen's algorithm,
    published in 1969 \cite{str69},
    whose time complexity is $O(n^{2.80735})$;
    the best current algorithm \cite{gal14}
    works in $O(n^{2.37286})$ time.},
    but they are mostly of theoretical interest
    and such algorithms are not necessary
    in competitive programming.


    \subsubsection{Matrix power}

    \index{matrix power}

    The power $A^k$ of a matrix $A$ is defined
    if $A$ is a square matrix.
    The definition is based on matrix multiplication:
    \[ A^k = \underbrace{A \cdot A \cdot A \cdots A}_{\textrm{$k$ times}} \]
    For example,

    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^3 =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix} \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix} \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix} =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      48 & 165 \\
      33 & 114 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]
    In addition, $A^0$ is an identity matrix. For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^0 =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    The matrix $A^k$ can be efficiently calculated
    in $O(n^3 \log k)$ time using the
    algorithm in Chapter 21.2. For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^8 =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^4 \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^4.
    \]

    \subsubsection{Determinant}

    \index{determinant}

    The \key{determinant} $\det(A)$ of a matrix $A$
    is defined if $A$ is a square matrix.
    If $A$ is of size $1 \times 1$,
    then $\det(A)=A[1,1]$.
    The determinant of a larger matrix is
    calculated recursively using the formula \index{cofactor}
    \[\det(A)=\sum_{j=1}^n A[1,j] C[1,j],\]
    where $C[i,j]$ is the \key{cofactor} of $A$
    at $[i,j]$.
    The cofactor is calculated using the formula
    \[C[i,j] = (-1)^{i+j} \det(M[i,j]),\]
    where $M[i,j]$ is obtained by removing
    row $i$ and column $j$ from $A$.
    Due to the coefficient $(-1)^{i+j}$ in the cofactor,
    every other determinant is positive
    and negative.
    For example,
    \[
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      3 & 4 \\
      1 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    ) = 3 \cdot 6 - 4 \cdot 1 = 14 
    \]
    and
    \[
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 4 & 3 \\
      5 & 1 & 6 \\
      7 & 2 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    ) = 
    2 \cdot
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 6 \\
      2 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    )
    -4 \cdot
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      5 & 6 \\
      7 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    )
    +3 \cdot
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      5 & 1 \\
      7 & 2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    ) = 81.
    \]

    \index{inverse matrix}

    The determinant of $A$ tells us
    whether there is an \key{inverse matrix}
    $A^{-1}$ such that $A \cdot A^{-1} = I$,
    where $I$ is an identity matrix.
    It turns out that $A^{-1}$ exists
    exactly when $\det(A) \neq 0$,
    and it can be calculated using the formula

    \[A^{-1}[i,j] = \frac{C[j,i]}{det(A)}.\]

    For example,

    \[
    \underbrace{
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 4 & 3\\
      5 & 1 & 6\\
      7 & 2 & 4\\
     \end{bmatrix}
    }_{A}
    \cdot
    \underbrace{
     \frac{1}{81}
     \begin{bmatrix}
       -8 & -10 & 21 \\
       22 & -13 & 3 \\
       3 & 24 & -18 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    }_{A^{-1}}
    =
    \underbrace{
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    }_{I}.

    Title: Basic Geometry
    Part: 2/3
    ```

    To see the next important property we should take a look at the set of points $\mathbf r$ for which $\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf a = C$ for some fixed constant $C$.
    You can see that this set of points is exactly the set of points for which the projection onto $\mathbf a$ is the point $C \cdot \dfrac{\mathbf a}{|\mathbf a|}$ and they form a hyperplane orthogonal to $\mathbf a$.
    You can see the vector $\mathbf a$ alongside with several such vectors having same dot product with it in 2D on the picture below:

    <center>![Vectors having same dot product with a](https://i.imgur.com/eyO7St4.png)</center>

    In 2D these vectors will form a line, in 3D they will form a plane.
    Note that this result allows us to define a line in 2D as $\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n=C$ or $(\mathbf r - \mathbf r_0)\cdot \mathbf n=0$ where $\mathbf n$ is vector orthogonal to the line and $\mathbf r_0$ is any vector already present on the line and $C = \mathbf r_0\cdot \mathbf n$.
    In the same manner a plane can be defined in 3D.

    ## Cross product

    ### Definition

    Assume you have three vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ in 3D space joined in a parallelepiped as in the picture below:
    <center>![Three vectors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Parallelepiped_volume.svg/240px-Parallelepiped_volume.svg.png)</center>

    How would you calculate its volume?
    From school we know that we should multiply the area of the base with the height, which is projection of $\mathbf a$ onto direction orthogonal to base.
    That means that if we define $\mathbf b \times \mathbf c$ as the vector which is orthogonal to both $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ and which length is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ then $|\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times\mathbf c)|$ will be equal to the volume of the parallelepiped.
    For integrity we will say that $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ will be always directed in such way that the rotation from the vector $\mathbf b$ to the vector $\mathbf c$ from the point of $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ is always counter-clockwise (see the picture below).

    <center>![cross product](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Cross_product_vector.svg/250px-Cross_product_vector.svg.png)</center>

    This defines the cross (or vector) product $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ of the vectors $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ and the triple product $\mathbf a\cdot(\mathbf b\times \mathbf c)$ of the vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$.

    Some notable properties of cross and triple products:

    1.  $\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = -\mathbf b\times \mathbf a$
    2.  $(\alpha \cdot \mathbf a)\times \mathbf b = \alpha \cdot (\mathbf a\times \mathbf b)$
    3.  For any $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ there is exactly one vector $\mathbf r$ such that $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf a\cdot\mathbf r$ for any vector $\mathbf a$. <br>Indeed if there are two such vectors $\mathbf r_1$ and $\mathbf r_2$ then $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf r_1 - \mathbf r_2)=0$ for all vectors $\mathbf a$ which is possible only when $\mathbf r_1 = \mathbf r_2$.
    4.  $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf b\cdot (\mathbf c\times \mathbf a) = -\mathbf a\cdot( \mathbf c\times \mathbf b)$
    5.  $(\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c = \mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c$.
        Indeed for all vectors $\mathbf r$ the chain of equations holds:

        \[\mathbf r\cdot( (\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c) = (\mathbf a + \mathbf b) \cdot (\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) =  \mathbf a \cdot(\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) + \mathbf b\cdot(\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) = \mathbf r\cdot (\mathbf a\times \mathbf c) + \mathbf r\cdot(\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf r\cdot(\mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c)\]

        Which proves $(\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c = \mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ due to point 3.

    6.  $|\mathbf a\times \mathbf b|=|\mathbf a| \cdot |\mathbf b| \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is angle between $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$, since $|\mathbf a\times \mathbf b|$ equals to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$. 

    Given all this and that the following equation holds for the unit vectors

    $$\mathbf e_x\times \mathbf e_x = \mathbf e_y\times \mathbf e_y = \mathbf e_z\times \mathbf e_z = \mathbf 0,\\
    \mathbf e_x\times \mathbf e_y = \mathbf e_z,~\mathbf e_y\times \mathbf e_z = \mathbf e_x,~\mathbf e_z\times \mathbf e_x = \mathbf e_y$$

    we can calculate the cross product of $\mathbf a = (x_1;y_1;z_1)$ and $\mathbf b = (x_2;y_2;z_2)$ in coordinate form:

    $$\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = (x_1 \cdot \mathbf e_x + y_1 \cdot \mathbf e_y + z_1 \cdot \mathbf e_z)\times (x_2 \cdot \mathbf e_x + y_2 \cdot \mathbf e_y + z_2 \cdot \mathbf e_z) =$$

    $$(y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2)\mathbf e_x  + (z_1 x_2 - x_1 z_2)\mathbf e_y + (x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2)$$

    Which also can be written in the more elegant form:

    $$\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = \begin{vmatrix}\mathbf e_x & \mathbf e_y & \mathbf e_z \\ x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \end{vmatrix},~a\cdot(b\times c) = \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\ x_3 & y_3 & z_3 \end{vmatrix}$$

    Here $| \cdot |$ stands for the determinant of a matrix. 

    Some kind of cross product (namely the pseudo-scalar product) can also be implemented in the 2D case.
    If we would like to calculate the area of parallelogram formed by vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ we would compute $|\mathbf e_z\cdot(\mathbf a\times \mathbf b)| = |x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2|$.
    Another way to obtain the same result is to multiply $|\mathbf a|$ (base of parallelogram) with the height, which is the projection of vector $\mathbf b$ onto vector $\mathbf a$ rotated by $90^\circ$ which in turn is $\widehat{\mathbf a}=(-y_1;x_1)$.
    That is, to calculate $|\widehat{\mathbf a}\cdot\mathbf b|=|x_1y_2 - y_1 x_2|$. 

    If we will take the sign into consideration then the area will be positive if the rotation from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ (i.e. from the view of the point of $\mathbf e_z$) is performed counter-clockwise and negative otherwise.
    That defines the pseudo-scalar product.
    Note that it also equals $|\mathbf a| \cdot |\mathbf b| \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is angle from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ count counter-clockwise (and negative if rotation is clockwise).

    Let's implement all this stuff!

    ```{.cpp file=crossproduct}
    point3d cross(point3d a, point3d b) {
        return point3d(a.y * b.z - a.z * b.y,
                       a.z * b.x - a.x * b.z,
                       a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x);
    }
    ftype triple(point3d a, point3d b, point3d c) {
        return dot(a, cross(b, c));
    }
    ftype cross(point2d a, point2d b) {
        return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;
    }
