INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/12 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as input and sorts the rows of this matrix based on the sum of the elements in each row. The rows should be arranged in ascending order according to these sums.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Calculate the sum of each row in the matrix.
   - Pair each row with its corresponding sum.
   - Sort these pairs based on the sums.
   - Extract the sorted rows from the sorted pairs to form the final sorted matrix.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sort_matrix(matrix):
       create a list of tuples where each tuple contains (sum of row, row)
       sort the list of tuples based on the first element (sum of row)
       create a new list to hold the sorted rows
       for each tuple in the sorted list:
           append the second element (the row) to the new list
       return the new list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sort_matrix(matrix):
    # Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the sum of the row and the row itself
    row_sums = [(sum(row), row) for row in matrix]
    
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the first element (the sum of the row)
    row_sums.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    # Create a new list to hold the sorted rows
    sorted_matrix = []
    
    # Extract the rows from the sorted list of tuples
    for _, row in row_sums:
        sorted_matrix.append(row)
    
    # Return the new list of sorted rows
    return sorted_matrix

    Title: Solving assignment problem using min-cost-flow
    Part: 1/1
    # Solving assignment problem using min-cost-flow

    The **assignment problem** has two equivalent statements:

       - Given a square matrix $A[1..N, 1..N]$, you need to select $N$ elements in it so that exactly one element is selected in each row and column, and the sum of the values of these elements is the smallest.
       - There are $N$ orders and $N$ machines. The cost of manufacturing on each machine is known for each order.  Only one order can be performed on each machine. It is required to assign all orders to the machines so that the total cost is minimized.

    Here we will consider the solution of the problem based on the algorithm for finding the [minimum cost flow (min-cost-flow)](min_cost_flow.md), solving the assignment problem in $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$.

    ## Description

    Let's build a bipartite network: there is a source $S$, a drain $T$, in the first part there are $N$ vertices (corresponding to rows of the matrix, or orders), in the second there are also $N$ vertices (corresponding to the columns of the matrix, or machines). Between each vertex $i$ of the first set and each vertex $j$ of the second set, we draw an edge with bandwidth 1 and cost $A_{ij}$. From the source $S$ we draw edges to all vertices $i$ of the first set with bandwidth 1 and cost 0. We draw an edge with bandwidth 1 and cost 0 from each vertex of the second set $j$ to the drain $T$.

    We find in the resulting network the maximum flow of the minimum cost. Obviously, the value of the flow will be $N$. Further, for each vertex $i$ of the first segment there is exactly one vertex $j$ of the second segment, such that the flow $F_{ij}$ = 1. Finally, this is a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of the first segment and the vertices of the second part, which is the solution to the problem (since the found flow has a minimal cost, then the sum of the costs of the selected edges will be the lowest possible, which is the optimality criterion).

    The complexity of this solution of the assignment problem depends on the algorithm by which the search for the maximum flow of the minimum cost is performed. The complexity will be $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ using [Dijkstra](dijkstra.md) or $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ using [Bellman-Ford](bellman_ford.md). This is due to the fact that the flow is of size $O(N)$ and each iteration of Dijkstra algorithm can be performed in $O(N^2)$, while it is $O(N^3)$ for Bellman-Ford.

    ## Implementation

    The implementation given here is long, it can probably be significantly reduced.
    It uses the [SPFA algorithm](bellman_ford.md) for finding shortest paths.

    const int INF = 1000 * 1000 * 1000;

        int s = m - 2, t = m - 1;
        int cost = 0;

    Title: Finding the rank of a matrix
    Part: 1/1
    # Finding the rank of a matrix

    **The rank of a matrix** is the largest number of linearly independent rows/columns of the matrix. The rank is not only defined  for square matrices.

    The rank of a matrix can also be defined as the largest order of any non-zero minor in the matrix.

    Let the matrix be rectangular and have size $N \times M$.
    Note that if the matrix is square and its determinant is non-zero, then the rank is $N$ ($=M$); otherwise it will be less. Generally, the rank of a matrix does not exceed $\min (N, M)$.

    ## Algorithm

    You can search for the rank using [Gaussian elimination](linear-system-gauss.md). We will perform the same operations as when solving the system or finding its determinant. But if at any step in the $i$-th column there are no rows with an non-empty entry among those that we didn't selected already, then we skip this step.
    Otherwise, if we have found a row with a non-zero element in the $i$-th column during the $i$-th step, then we mark this row as a selected one, increase the rank by one (initially the rank is set equal to $0$), and perform the usual operations of taking this row away from the rest.

    ## Complexity

    This algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.

    ## Implementation

    ```{.cpp file=matrix-rank}
    const double EPS = 1E-9;

    int compute_rank(vector<vector<double>> A) {
        int n = A.size();
        int m = A[0].size();

        int rank = 0;
        vector<bool> row_selected(n, false);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            int j;
            for (j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (!row_selected[j] && abs(A[j][i]) > EPS)
                    break;
            }

            if (j != n) {
                ++rank;
                row_selected[j] = true;
                for (int p = i + 1; p < m; ++p)
                    A[j][p] /= A[j][i];
                for (int k = 0; k < n; ++k) {
                    if (k != j && abs(A[k][i]) > EPS) {
                        for (int p = i + 1; p < m; ++p)
                            A[k][p] -= A[j][p] * A[k][i];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return rank;
    }
    ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/12 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as input and sorts the rows of this matrix based on the sum of the elements in each row. The rows should be arranged in ascending order according to these sums.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Calculate the sum of each row in the matrix.
   - Pair each row with its corresponding sum.
   - Sort these pairs based on the sums.
   - Extract the sorted rows from the sorted pairs to form the final sorted matrix.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sort_matrix(matrix):
       create a list of tuples (sum_of_row, row) for each row in matrix
       sort the list of tuples based on the sum_of_row
       extract the sorted rows from the sorted list of tuples
       return the list of sorted rows
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sort_matrix(matrix):
    # Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the sum of the row and the row itself
    row_sums = [(sum(row), row) for row in matrix]
    
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the first element (the sum of the row)
    row_sums.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    # Extract the sorted rows from the sorted list of tuples
    sorted_matrix = [row for _, row in row_sums]
