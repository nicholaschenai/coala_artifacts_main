INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple represents the sums of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through all possible pairs of tuples from the input list. For each pair, we will calculate the sum of the first elements and the sum of the second elements. We will store these sums as new tuples in a result list. Finally, we will return the result list containing all the unique combinations of sums.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_combinations(tuple_list):
       initialize an empty list for results
       for each tuple i in tuple_list:
           for each tuple j in tuple_list:
               calculate sum1 as i[0] + j[0]
               calculate sum2 as i[1] + j[1]
               create a new tuple (sum1, sum2)
               add the new tuple to results
       return results

    \section{Knapsack problems}

    \index{knapsack}

    The term \key{knapsack} refers to problems where
    a set of objects is given, and 
    subsets with some properties
    have to be found.
    Knapsack problems can often be solved
    using dynamic programming.

    In this section, we focus on the following
    problem: Given a list of weights
    $[w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n]$,
    determine all
    sums that can be constructed using the weights.
    For example, if the weights are
    $[1,3,3,5]$, the following sums are possible:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    In this case, all sums between $0 \ldots 12$
    are possible, except 2 and 10.
    For example, the sum 7 is possible because we
    can select the weights $[1,3,3]$.

    To solve the problem, we focus on subproblems
    where we only use the first $k$ weights
    to construct sums.
    Let $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{true}$ if
    we can construct a sum $x$
    using the first $k$ weights,
    and otherwise $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{false}$.
    The values of the function can be recursively
    calculated as follows:
    \[ \texttt{possible}(x,k) = \texttt{possible}(x-w_k,k-1) \lor \texttt{possible}(x,k-1) \]
    The formula is based on the fact that we can
    either use or not use the weight $w_k$ in the sum.
    If we use $w_k$, the remaining task is to
    form the sum $x-w_k$ using the first $k-1$ weights,
    and if we do not use $w_k$,
    the remaining task is to form the sum $x$
    using the first $k-1$ weights.
    As the base cases,
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{possible}(x,0) = \begin{cases}
                   \textrm{true}    & x = 0\\
                   \textrm{false}   & x \neq 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    because if no weights are used,
    we can only form the sum 0.

    The following table shows all values of the function
    for the weights $[1,3,3,5]$ (the symbol ''X''
    indicates the true values):

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
    $k \backslash x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     0 & X & \\
     1 & X & X \\
     2 & X & X & & X & X \\
     3 & X & X & & X & X & & X & X \\
     4 & X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    After calculating those values, $\texttt{possible}(x,n)$
    tells us whether we can construct a
    sum $x$ using \emph{all} weights.

    Let $W$ denote the total sum of the weights.
    The following $O(nW)$ time
    dynamic programming solution
    corresponds to the recursive function:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0][0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = 0; x <= W; x++) {
            if (x-w[k] >= 0) possible[x][k] |= possible[x-w[k]][k-1];
            possible[x][k] |= possible[x][k-1];
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    However, here is a better implementation that only uses
    a one-dimensional array $\texttt{possible}[x]$
    that indicates whether we can construct a subset with sum $x$.
    The trick is to update the array from right to left for
    each new weight:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = W; x >= 0; x--) {
            if (possible[x]) possible[x+w[k]] = true;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that the general idea presented here can be used
    in many knapsack problems.
    For example, if we are given objects with weights and values,
    we can determine for each weight sum the maximum value
    sum of a subset.

    Title: Finding the nearest pair of points
    Part: 1/3
    # Finding the nearest pair of points

    ## Problem statement

    Given $n$ points on the plane. Each point $p_i$ is defined by its coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$. It is required to find among them two such points, such that the distance between them is minimal:

    $$ \min_{\scriptstyle i, j=0 \ldots n-1,\atop \scriptstyle i \neq j } \rho (p_i, p_j). $$

    We take the usual Euclidean distances:

    $$ \rho (p_i,p_j) = \sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2} .$$

    The trivial algorithm - iterating over all pairs and calculating the distance for each — works in $O(n^2)$. 

    The algorithm running in time $O(n \log n)$ is described below. This algorithm was proposed by Shamos and Hoey in 1975. (Source: Ch. 5 Notes of _Algorithm Design_ by Kleinberg & Tardos, also see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4567872)) Preparata and Shamos also showed that this algorithm is optimal in the decision tree model.

    ## Algorithm
    We construct an algorithm according to the general scheme of **divide-and-conquer** algorithms: the algorithm is designed as a recursive function, to which we pass a set of points; this recursive function splits this set in half, calls itself recursively on each half, and then performs some operations to combine the answers. The operation of combining consist of  detecting the cases when one point of the optimal solution fell into one half, and the other point into the other (in this case, recursive calls from each of the halves cannot detect this pair separately). The main difficulty, as always in case of divide and conquer algorithms, lies in the effective implementation of the merging stage. If a set of $n$ points is passed to the recursive function, then the merge stage should work no more than $O(n)$, then the asymptotics of the whole algorithm $T(n)$ will be found from the equation:

    $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).$$ 

    The solution to this equation, as is known, is $T(n) = O(n \log n).$

    So, we proceed on to the construction of the algorithm. In order to come to an effective implementation of the merge stage in the future, we will divide the set of points into two subsets, according to their $x$-coordinates: In fact, we draw some vertical line dividing the set of points into two subsets of approximately the same size. It is convenient to make such a partition as follows: We sort the points in the standard way as pairs of numbers, ie.:

    $$p_i < p_j \Longleftrightarrow (x_i < x_j) \lor \Big(\left(x_i = x_j\right) \wedge \left(y_i < y_j \right) \Big) $$

    Then take the middle point after sorting $p_m (m = \lfloor n/2 \rfloor)$, and all the points before it and the $p_m$ itself are assigned to the first half, and all the points after it - to the second half:

    $$A_1 = \{p_i \ | \ i = 0 \ldots m \}$$

    $$A_2 = \{p_i \ | \ i = m + 1 \ldots n-1 \}.$$ 

    Now, calling recursively on each of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, we will find the answers $h_1$ and $h_2$ for each of the halves. And take the best of them: $h = \min(h_1, h_2)$.

    Now we need to make a **merge stage**, i.e. we try to find such pairs of points, for which the distance between which is less than $h$ and one point is lying in $A_1$ and the other in $A_2$.
    It is obvious that it is sufficient to consider only those points that are separated from the vertical line by a distance less than $h$, i.e. the set $B$ of the points considered at this stage is equal to:

    $$B = \{ p_i\ | \ | x_i - x_m\ | < h \}.$$ 

    For each point in the set $B$, we try to find the points that are closer to it than $h$. For example, it is sufficient to consider only those points whose $y$-coordinate differs by no more than $h$. Moreover, it makes no sense to consider those points whose $y$-coordinate is greater than the $y$-coordinate of the current point. Thus, for each point $p_i$ we define the set of considered points $C(p_i)$ as follows:

    $$C(p_i) = \{ p_j\ |\ p_j \in B,\ \ y_i - h < y_j \le y_i \}.$$

    If we sort the points of the set $B$ by $y$-coordinate, it will be very easy to find $C(p_i)$: these are several points in a row ahead to the point $p_i$.

    So, in the new notation, the **merging stage** looks like this: build a set $B$, sort the points in it by $y$-coordinate, then for each point $p_i \in B$ consider all points $p_j \in C(p_i)$, and for each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ calculate the distance and compare with the current best distance.

    At first glance, this is still a non-optimal algorithm: it seems that the sizes of sets $C(p_i)$ will be of order $n$, and the required asymptotics will not work. However, surprisingly, it can be proved that the size of each of the sets $C(p_i)$ is a quantity $O(1)$, i.e. it does not exceed some small constant regardless of the points themselves. Proof of this fact is given in the next section.

    Finally, we pay attention to the sorting, which the above algorithm contains: first,sorting by pairs $(x, y)$, and then second, sorting the elements of the set $B$ by $y$. In fact, both of these sorts inside the recursive function can be eliminated (otherwise we would not reach the $O(n)$ estimate for the **merging stage**, and the general asymptotics of the algorithm would be $O(n \log^2 n)$). It is easy to get rid of the first sort — it is enough to perform this sort before starting the recursion: after all, the elements themselves do not change inside the recursion, so there is no need to sort again. With the second sorting a little more difficult to perform, performing it previously will not work. But, remembering the merge sort, which also works on the principle of divide-and-conquer, we can simply embed this sort in our recursion. Let recursion, taking some set of points (as we remember,ordered by pairs $(x, y)$), return the same set, but sorted by the $y$-coordinate. To do this, simply merge (in $O(n)$) the two results returned by recursive calls. This will result in a set sorted by $y$-coordinate.

    ## Evaluation of the asymptotics

    To show that the above algorithm is actually executed in $O(n \log n)$, we need to prove the following fact: $|C(p_i)| = O(1)$.

    So, let us consider some point $p_i$; recall that the set $C(p_i)$ is a set of points whose $y$-coordinate lies in the segment $[y_i-h; y_i]$, and, moreover, along the $x$ coordinate, the point $p_i$ itself, and all the points of the set $C(p_i)$ lie in the band width $2h$. In other words, the points we are considering $p_i$ and $C(p_i)$ lie in a rectangle of size $2h \times h$.

    Our task is to estimate the maximum number of points that can lie in this rectangle $2h \times h$; thus, we estimate the maximum size of the set $C(p_i)$. At the same time, when evaluating, we must not forget that there may be repeated points.

    Remember that $h$ was obtained from the results of two recursive calls — on sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ contains points to the left of the partition line and partially on it, $A_2$ contains the remaining points of the partition line and points to the right of it. For any pair of points from $A_1$, as well as from $A_2$, the distance can not be less than $h$ — otherwise it would mean incorrect operation of the recursive function.

    To estimate the maximum number of points in the rectangle $2h \times h$ we divide it into two squares $h \times h$, the first square include all points $C(p_i) \cap A_1$, and the second contains all the others, i.e. $C(p_i) \cap A_2$. It follows from the above considerations that in each of these squares the distance between any two points is at least $h$.

    We show that there are at most four points in each square. For example, this can be done as follows: divide the square into $4$ sub-squares with sides $h/2$. Then there can be no more than one point in each of these sub-squares (since even the diagonal is equal to $h / \sqrt{2}$, which is less than $h$). Therefore, there can be no more than $4$ points in the whole square.

    So, we have proved that in a rectangle $2h \times h$ can not be more than $4 \cdot 2 = 8$ points, and, therefore, the size of the set $C(p_i)$ cannot exceed $7$, as required.

    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations
    Part: 1/1
    # Generating all $K$-combinations

    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.
    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.
    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.

    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label="Generate next lexicographical K-combination"}

    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.
    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how
    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our
    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once
    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent
    elements.

    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}
    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {
        int k = (int)a.size();
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {
                a[i]++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)
                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    ```

    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label="Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element"}

    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such
    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.

    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):
    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.

    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:
    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.
    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the
    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove
    a number, add a number).

    Let us prove this:

    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can 
    be obtained as follows:

    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \cup 1G(N-1)^\text{R}$$

    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the 
    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and
    concatenate these two sequences.

    Now we may produce our proof.

    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note
    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As
    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.
    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.

    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.

    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.

    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size
    $K$.

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}
    int gray_code (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }

    int count_bits (int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (; n; n >>= 1)
            res += n & 1;
        return res;
    }

    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            int cur = gray_code (i);
            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (cur & (1 << j))
                        cout << j + 1;
                }
                cout << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus
    works in $O\left(N \cdot \binom{N}{K}\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant
    than the previous solution.

    The implementation is derived from the formula:

    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\text{R}$$

    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the
    subsequence from appropriate elements.

    Its implementation is as follows:

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}
    vector<int> ans;

    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {
        if (k > n || k < 0)
            return;

        if (!n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {
                if (ans[i])
                    cout << i + 1;
            }
            cout << "\n";
            return;
        }

        ans[idx] = rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);
        ans[idx] = !rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);
    }

    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {
        ans.resize(n);
        gen(n, k, 0, false);
    }
    ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples that represent all possible combinations of sums formed by adding the first element of one tuple to the second element of another tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each pair of tuples in the list. For each pair, we will calculate the sum of the first element of the first tuple and the second element of the second tuple. We will store these sums in a new list as tuples. We need to ensure that we do not repeat any combinations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_combinations(tuple_list):
       create an empty list for results
       for each tuple i in tuple_list:
           for each tuple j in tuple_list:
               if i is not the same as j:
                   create a new tuple with (i[0] + j[1], i[1] + j[0])

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the previous solution went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: 
   The goal is to find combinations of sums using the first element of one tuple and the second element of another tuple. The expected output is a list of tuples that represent these combinations.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   In the previous solution, I incorrectly calculated the sums. The intended operation is to take the first element of one tuple and add it to the second element of another tuple, and vice versa. However, I mistakenly added the first element of the first tuple to the second element of the second tuple and the second element of the first tuple to the first element of the second tuple.

3. **Correcting the Logic**:
   The correct approach should be:
   - For each pair of tuples (i, j), compute:
     - The sum of the first element of tuple i and the second element of tuple j.
     - The sum of the second element of tuple i and the first element of tuple j.
   - Store these results in a new list.

4. **Revising the Pseudocode**:

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    Note that it is possible to solve the problem
    in another way in $O(n \log n)$ time using binary search.
    In such a solution, we iterate through the array
    and for each array value, we try to find another
    value that yields the sum $x$.
    This can be done by performing $n$ binary searches,
    each of which takes $O(\log n)$ time.

    \index{3SUM problem}
    A more difficult problem is 
    the \key{3SUM problem} that asks to
    find \emph{three} array values
    whose sum is $x$.
    Using the idea of the above algorithm,
    this problem can be solved in $O(n^2)$ time\footnote{For a long time,
    it was thought that solving
    the 3SUM problem more efficiently than in $O(n^2)$ time
    would not be possible.
    However, in 2014, it turned out \cite{gro14}
    that this is not the case.}.

    Chapter: Dynamic programming
    Section: Knapsack problems
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Knapsack problems}

    \index{knapsack}

    The term \key{knapsack} refers to problems where
    a set of objects is given, and 
    subsets with some properties
    have to be found.
    Knapsack problems can often be solved
    using dynamic programming.

    In this section, we focus on the following
    problem: Given a list of weights
    $[w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n]$,
    determine all
    sums that can be constructed using the weights.
    For example, if the weights are
    $[1,3,3,5]$, the following sums are possible:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    In this case, all sums between $0 \ldots 12$
    are possible, except 2 and 10.
    For example, the sum 7 is possible because we
    can select the weights $[1,3,3]$.

    To solve the problem, we focus on subproblems
    where we only use the first $k$ weights
    to construct sums.
    Let $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{true}$ if
    we can construct a sum $x$
    using the first $k$ weights,
    and otherwise $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{false}$.
    The values of the function can be recursively
    calculated as follows:
    \[ \texttt{possible}(x,k) = \texttt{possible}(x-w_k,k-1) \lor \texttt{possible}(x,k-1) \]
    The formula is based on the fact that we can
    either use or not use the weight $w_k$ in the sum.
    If we use $w_k$, the remaining task is to
    form the sum $x-w_k$ using the first $k-1$ weights,
    and if we do not use $w_k$,
    the remaining task is to form the sum $x$
    using the first $k-1$ weights.
    As the base cases,
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{possible}(x,0) = \begin{cases}
                   \textrm{true}    & x = 0\\
                   \textrm{false}   & x \neq 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    because if no weights are used,
    we can only form the sum 0.

    The following table shows all values of the function
    for the weights $[1,3,3,5]$ (the symbol ''X''
    indicates the true values):

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
    $k \backslash x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     0 & X & \\
     1 & X & X \\
     2 & X & X & & X & X \\
     3 & X & X & & X & X & & X & X \\
     4 & X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    After calculating those values, $\texttt{possible}(x,n)$
    tells us whether we can construct a
    sum $x$ using \emph{all} weights.

    Let $W$ denote the total sum of the weights.
    The following $O(nW)$ time
    dynamic programming solution
    corresponds to the recursive function:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0][0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = 0; x <= W; x++) {
            if (x-w[k] >= 0) possible[x][k] |= possible[x-w[k]][k-1];
            possible[x][k] |= possible[x][k-1];
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    However, here is a better implementation that only uses
    a one-dimensional array $\texttt{possible}[x]$
    that indicates whether we can construct a subset with sum $x$.
    The trick is to update the array from right to left for
    each new weight:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = W; x >= 0; x--) {
            if (possible[x]) possible[x+w[k]] = true;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that the general idea presented here can be used
    in many knapsack problems.
    For example, if we are given objects with weights and values,
    we can determine for each weight sum the maximum value
    sum of a subset.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the implementation of the `find_combinations` function to ensure it accurately computes the required combinations of sums from the tuples.

The correct logic is to iterate through each pair of tuples and compute the sums as follows:
- For each tuple \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \), we need to compute:
  - \( (a + d, b + c) \)
  - This means we take the first element of the first tuple and add it to the second element of the second tuple, and vice versa.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples that represent all possible combinations of sums formed by adding the first element of one tuple to the second element of another tuple.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the previous solution went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: 
   The goal is to find combinations of sums using the first element of one tuple and the second element of another tuple. The expected output is a list of tuples that represent these combinations.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   In the previous solution, I incorrectly calculated the sums. The intended operation is to take the first element of one tuple and add it to the second element of another tuple, and vice versa. However, I mistakenly added the first element of the first tuple to the second element of the second tuple and the second element of the first tuple to the first element of the second tuple.

3. **Correcting the Logic**:
   The correct approach should be:
   - For each pair of tuples (i, j), compute:
     - The sum of the first element of tuple i and the second element of tuple j.
     - The sum of the second element of tuple i and the first element of tuple j.
   - Store these results in a new list.

4. **Revising the Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function find_combinations(tuple_list):
       create an empty list for results
       for each tuple i in tuple_list:
           for each tuple j in tuple_list:
               if i is not the same as j:
                   create a new tuple with (i[0] + j[1], i[1] + j[0])  # Correct the order of addition
                   add this new tuple to results
       return results
   ```

5. **Implementing the Corrected Solution**:
Now, I will implement the corrected logic in the Python function.

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple
            if i != j:
                # Create a new tuple with the correct sums of the respective elements
                new_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][1], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][0])
                # Add the new tuple to the results
                results.append(new_tuple)

  - This means we take the first element of the first tuple and add it to the second element of the second tuple, and vice versa.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple
            if i != j:
                # Create a new tuple with the correct sums of the respective elements
                new_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][1], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][0])
                # Add the new tuple to the results
                results.append(new_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of results
    return results
```

This implementation correctly computes the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step to identify the issues with the current implementation of the `find_combinations` function.

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: 
   The function is supposed to return a list of tuples that represent all possible combinations of sums formed by adding the first element of one tuple to the second element of another tuple, and vice versa. 

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   The previous implementation is not producing the expected output. The expected output for the input `[(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]` is `[(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]`. However, the output is not matching this expectation.

3. **Correcting the Logic**:
   Upon reviewing the requirements again, I realize that I need to ensure that I am correctly generating all combinations of sums. The expected output suggests that the order of the sums matters, and I need to ensure that I am capturing all unique combinations.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - I need to iterate through each tuple and compute the sums correctly.
   - I should ensure that I am not duplicating combinations and that I am capturing all unique pairs.

5. **Implementing the Corrected Solution**:
   I will revise the implementation to ensure it captures the correct combinations of sums.

Here is the corrected Python code:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples that represent all possible combinations of sums formed by adding the first element of one tuple to the second element of another tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each pair of tuples in the list. For each pair, we will calculate the sum of the first element of the first tuple and the second element of the second tuple. We will store these sums in a new list as tuples. We need to ensure that we do not repeat any combinations.

   ```
   function find_combinations(tuple_list):

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the previous solution went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: 
   The goal is to find combinations of sums using the first element of one tuple and the second element of another tuple. The expected output is a list of tuples that represent these combinations.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   In the previous solution, I incorrectly calculated the sums. The intended operation is to take the first element of one tuple and add it to the second element of another tuple, and vice versa. However, I mistakenly added the first element of the first tuple to the second element of the second tuple and the second element of the first tuple to the first element of the second tuple.

3. **Correcting the Logic**:

     - The sum of the first element of tuple i and the second element of tuple j.
     - The sum of the second element of tuple i and the first element of tuple j.

- For each tuple \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \), we need to compute:
  - \( (a + d, b + c) \)
  - This means we take the first element of the first tuple and add it to the second element of the second tuple, and vice versa.

    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations
    Part: 1/1
    # Generating all $K$-combinations

    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.
    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.
    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.

    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label="Generate next lexicographical K-combination"}

    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.
    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how
    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our
    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once
    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent
    elements.

    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}
    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {
        int k = (int)a.size();
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {
                a[i]++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)
                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    ```

    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label="Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element"}

    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such
    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.

    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):
    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.

    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:
    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.
    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the
    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove
    a number, add a number).

    Let us prove this:

    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can 
    be obtained as follows:

    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \cup 1G(N-1)^\text{R}$$

    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the 
    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and
    concatenate these two sequences.

    Now we may produce our proof.

    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note
    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As
    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.
    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.

    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.

    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.

    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size
    $K$.

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}
    int gray_code (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }

    int count_bits (int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (; n; n >>= 1)
            res += n & 1;
        return res;
    }

    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            int cur = gray_code (i);
            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (cur & (1 << j))
                        cout << j + 1;
                }
                cout << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus
    works in $O\left(N \cdot \binom{N}{K}\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant
    than the previous solution.

    The implementation is derived from the formula:

    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\text{R}$$

    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the
    subsequence from appropriate elements.

    Its implementation is as follows:

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}
    vector<int> ans;

    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {
        if (k > n || k < 0)
            return;

        if (!n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {
                if (ans[i])

    \index{combinatorics}

    \key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting
    combinations of objects.
    Usually, the goal is to find a way to
    count the combinations efficiently
    without generating each combination separately.

    As an example, consider the problem
    of counting the number of ways to
    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.
    For example, there are 8 representations
    for $4$:
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1+1+1+1$
    \item $1+1+2$
    \item $1+2+1$
    \item $2+1+1$
    \item $2+2$
    \item $3+1$
    \item $1+3$
    \item $4$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}

    A combinatorial problem can often be solved
    using a recursive function.
    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$
    that gives the number of representations for $n$.
    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.
    The values of the function
    can be recursively calculated as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        f(n) = \begin{cases}
                   1               & n = 0\\
                   f(0)+f(1)+\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case is $f(0)=1$,
    because the empty sum represents the number 0.
    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to
    choose the first number of the sum.
    If the first number is $k$,
    there are $f(n-k)$ representations
    for the remaining part of the sum.
    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values
    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.

    The first values for the function are:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    f(0) & = & 1 \\
    f(1) & = & 1 \\
    f(2) & = & 2 \\
    f(3) & = & 4 \\
    f(4) & = & 8 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced
    with a closed-form formula.
    In this problem,
    \[
    f(n)=2^{n-1},
    \]
    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$
    possible positions for +-signs in the sum
    and we can choose any subset of them.

    \section{Binomial coefficients}

    \index{binomial coefficient}

    The \key{binomial coefficient} ${n \choose k}$
    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset
    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.
    For example, ${5 \choose 3}=10$,
    because the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:
    \[ \{1,2,3\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,2,5\}, \{1,3,4\}, \{1,3,5\}, 
    \{1,4,5\}, \{2,3,4\}, \{2,3,5\}, \{2,4,5\}, \{3,4,5\} \]

    \subsubsection{Formula 1}

    Binomial coefficients can be
    recursively calculated as follows:

    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}
    \]

    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.
    If $x$ is included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k-1$
    elements from $n-1$ elements,
    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.

    The base cases for the recursion are
    \[
    {n \choose 0}  =  {n \choose n} = 1,
    \]
    because there is always exactly
    one way to construct an empty subset
    and a subset that contains all the elements.

    \subsubsection{Formula 2}

    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.
    \]

    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.
    We go through all permutations and always
    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation
    in the subset.
    Since the order of the elements in the subset
    and outside the subset does not matter,
    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$

    \subsubsection{Properties}

    For binomial coefficients,
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n \choose n-k},
    \]
    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into
    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements
    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.

    The sum of binomial coefficients is
    \[
    {n \choose 0}+{n \choose 1}+{n \choose 2}+\ldots+{n \choose n}=2^n.
    \]

    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''
    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to
    the $n$th power:

    \[ (a+b)^n =
    {n \choose 0} a^n b^0 + 
    {n \choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +
    \ldots + 
    {n \choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +
    {n \choose n} a^0 b^n. \]

    \index{Pascal's triangle}

    Binomial coefficients also appear in
    \key{Pascal's triangle}
    where each value equals the sum of two
    above values:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}{0.9}
    \node at (0,0) {1};
    \node at (-0.5,-0.5) {1};
    \node at (0.5,-0.5) {1};
    \node at (-1,-1) {1};
    \node at (0,-1) {2};
    \node at (1,-1) {1};
    \node at (-1.5,-1.5) {1};
    \node at (-0.5,-1.5) {3};

    \node at (1,-2.5) {$\ldots$};
    \node at (2,-2.5) {$\ldots$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Boxes and balls}

    ''Boxes and balls'' is a useful model,
    where we count the ways to
    place $k$ balls in $n$ boxes.
    Let us consider three scenarios:

    \textit{Scenario 1}: Each box can contain
    at most one ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 10 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --
                        (#1+0.5,#2-0.5) -- (#1+0.5,#2+0.5);
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{
        \lax{#1}{#2}{#3}
        \lax{#1+1.2}{#2}{#4}
        \lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}
        \lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}
        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{-4}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    In this scenario, the answer is directly the
    binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 2}: A box can contain multiple balls.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 15 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --
                        (#1+0.5,#2-0.5) -- (#1+0.5,#2+0.5);
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{

        \lax{#1+1.2}{#2}{#4}
        \lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}
        \lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}
        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-8}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-6}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{-8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{-4}{0}{0}{0}{2}{0}
    \laa{16}{-6}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}
    \laa{16}{-8}{0}{0}{0}{0}{2}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The process of placing the balls in the boxes
    can be represented as a string
    that consists of symbols
    ''o'' and ''$\rightarrow$''.
    Initially, assume that we are standing at the leftmost box.
    The symbol ''o'' means that we place a ball
    in the current box, and the symbol
    ''$\rightarrow$'' means that we move to
    the next box to the right.

    Using this notation, each solution is a string
    that contains $k$ times the symbol ''o'' and
    $n-1$ times the symbol ''$\rightarrow$''.
    For example, the upper-right solution
    in the above picture corresponds to the string
    ''$\rightarrow$ $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$''.
    Thus, the number of solutions is
    ${k+n-1 \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 3}: Each box may contain at most one ball,
    and in addition, no two adjacent boxes may both contain a ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2

    \section{Knapsack problems}

    \index{knapsack}

    The term \key{knapsack} refers to problems where
    a set of objects is given, and 
    subsets with some properties
    have to be found.
    Knapsack problems can often be solved
    using dynamic programming.

    In this section, we focus on the following
    problem: Given a list of weights
    $[w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n]$,
    determine all
    sums that can be constructed using the weights.
    For example, if the weights are
    $[1,3,3,5]$, the following sums are possible:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    In this case, all sums between $0 \ldots 12$
    are possible, except 2 and 10.
    For example, the sum 7 is possible because we
    can select the weights $[1,3,3]$.

    To solve the problem, we focus on subproblems
    where we only use the first $k$ weights
    to construct sums.
    Let $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{true}$ if
    we can construct a sum $x$
    using the first $k$ weights,
    and otherwise $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{false}$.
    The values of the function can be recursively
    calculated as follows:
    \[ \texttt{possible}(x,k) = \texttt{possible}(x-w_k,k-1) \lor \texttt{possible}(x,k-1) \]
    The formula is based on the fact that we can
    either use or not use the weight $w_k$ in the sum.
    If we use $w_k$, the remaining task is to
    form the sum $x-w_k$ using the first $k-1$ weights,
    and if we do not use $w_k$,
    the remaining task is to form the sum $x$
    using the first $k-1$ weights.
    As the base cases,
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{possible}(x,0) = \begin{cases}
                   \textrm{true}    & x = 0\\
                   \textrm{false}   & x \neq 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    because if no weights are used,
    we can only form the sum 0.

    The following table shows all values of the function
    for the weights $[1,3,3,5]$ (the symbol ''X''
    indicates the true values):

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
    $k \backslash x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     0 & X & \\
     1 & X & X \\
     2 & X & X & & X & X \\
     3 & X & X & & X & X & & X & X \\
     4 & X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    After calculating those values, $\texttt{possible}(x,n)$
    tells us whether we can construct a
    sum $x$ using \emph{all} weights.

    Let $W$ denote the total sum of the weights.
    The following $O(nW)$ time
    dynamic programming solution
    corresponds to the recursive function:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0][0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = 0; x <= W; x++) {
            if (x-w[k] >= 0) possible[x][k] |= possible[x-w[k]][k-1];
            possible[x][k] |= possible[x][k-1];
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    However, here is a better implementation that only uses
    a one-dimensional array $\texttt{possible}[x]$
    that indicates whether we can construct a subset with sum $x$.
    The trick is to update the array from right to left for
    each new weight:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = W; x >= 0; x--) {
            if (possible[x]) possible[x+w[k]] = true;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that the general idea presented here can be used
    in many knapsack problems.
    For example, if we are given objects with weights and values,
    we can determine for each weight sum the maximum value
    sum of a subset.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] Based on the previous analysis and the insights gained, I will revise the implementation of the `find_combinations` function to ensure it correctly computes the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement.

### Key Points to Address:
1. **Correct Pairing**: For each pair of tuples, we need to compute the sums of the first element of one tuple with the second element of another tuple and vice versa.
2. **Unique Combinations**: We need to ensure that we are capturing all unique combinations without duplicates.

### Revised Approach:
- For each tuple \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \), we will compute:
  - \( (a + d, b + c) \)
- We will store these results in a set to avoid duplicates and then convert it back to a list before returning.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Create a set to store unique results
    results = set()
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple
            if i != j:

    # Convert the set back to a list and return

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples that represent all possible combinations of sums formed by adding the first element of one tuple to the second element of another tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each pair of tuples in the list. For each pair, we will calculate the sum of the first element of the first tuple and the second element of the second tuple. We will store these sums in a new list as tuples. We need to ensure that we do not repeat any combinations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_combinations(tuple_list):
       create an empty list for results
       for each tuple i in tuple_list:
           for each tuple j in tuple_list:

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the previous solution went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: 
   The goal is to find combinations of sums using the first element of one tuple and the second element of another tuple. The expected output is a list of tuples that represent these combinations.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   In the previous solution, I incorrectly calculated the sums. The intended operation is to take the first element of one tuple and add it to the second element of another tuple, and vice versa. However, I mistakenly added the first element of the first tuple to the second element of the second tuple and the second element of the first tuple to the first element of the second tuple.

3. **Correcting the Logic**:
   The correct approach should be:
   - For each pair of tuples (i, j), compute:
     - The sum of the first element of tuple i and the second element of tuple j.
     - The sum of the second element of tuple i and the first element of tuple j.
   - Store these results in a new list.

4. **Revising the Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function find_combinations(tuple_list):
       create an empty list for results
       for each tuple i in tuple_list:
           for each tuple j in tuple_list:
               if i is not the same as j:
                   create a new tuple with (i[0] + j[1], i[1] + j[0])  # Correct the order of addition
                   add this new tuple to results
       return results
   ```

5. **Implementing the Corrected Solution**:
Now, I will implement the corrected logic in the Python function.

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list

                new_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][1], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][0])
                # Add the new tuple to the results

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the implementation of the `find_combinations` function to ensure it accurately computes the required combinations of sums from the tuples.

The correct logic is to iterate through each pair of tuples and compute the sums as follows:
- For each tuple \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \), we need to compute:
  - \( (a + d, b + c) \)
  - This means we take the first element of the first tuple and add it to the second element of the second tuple, and vice versa.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple
            if i != j:
                # Create a new tuple with the correct sums of the respective elements
                new_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][1], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][0])

                results.append(new_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of results

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: 
   The function is supposed to return a list of tuples that represent all possible combinations of sums formed by adding the first element of one tuple to the second element of another tuple, and vice versa. 

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   The previous implementation is not producing the expected output. The expected output for the input `[(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]` is `[(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]`. However, the output is not matching this expectation.

3. **Correcting the Logic**:
   Upon reviewing the requirements again, I realize that I need to ensure that I am correctly generating all combinations of sums. The expected output suggests that the order of the sums matters, and I need to ensure that I am capturing all unique combinations.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - I need to iterate through each tuple and compute the sums correctly.
   - I should ensure that I am not duplicating combinations and that I am capturing all unique pairs.

5. **Implementing the Corrected Solution**:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] Based on the previous analysis and the insights gained, I will revise the implementation of the `find_combinations` function to ensure it correctly computes the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement.

### Key Points to Address:
1. **Correct Pairing**: For each pair of tuples, we need to compute the sums of the first element of one tuple with the second element of another tuple and vice versa.
2. **Unique Combinations**: We need to ensure that we are capturing all unique combinations without duplicates.

### Revised Approach:
- For each tuple \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \), we will compute:
  - \( (a + d, b + c) \)
- We will store these results in a set to avoid duplicates and then convert it back to a list before returning.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Create a set to store unique results
    results = set()
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple
            if i != j:
                # Create a new tuple with the sums of the respective elements
                new_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][1], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][0])
                # Add the new tuple to the results set
                results.add(new_tuple)
    
    # Convert the set back to a list and return
    return list(results)
```

This implementation should now correctly compute the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement, ensuring that all unique combinations are captured.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the implementation of the `find_combinations` function to ensure it accurately computes the required combinations of sums from the tuples.

The correct logic is to iterate through each pair of tuples and compute the sums as follows:
- For each tuple \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \), we need to compute:
  - \( (a + d, b + c) \)
  - This means we take the first element of the first tuple and add it to the second element of the second tuple, and vice versa.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple
            if i != j:
                # Create a new tuple with the correct sums of the respective elements
                new_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][1], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][0])
                # Add the new tuple to the results
                results.append(new_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of results
    return results
```

This implementation correctly computes the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement.

## Instructions

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step to identify the issues with the current implementation of the `find_combinations` function.

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: 
   The function is supposed to return a list of tuples that represent all possible combinations of sums formed by adding the first element of one tuple to the second element of another tuple, and vice versa. 

2. **Identifying the Mistake**:
   The previous implementation is not producing the expected output. The expected output for the input `[(2, 4), (6, 7), (5, 1), (6, 10)]` is `[(8, 11), (7, 5), (8, 14), (11, 8), (12, 17), (11, 11)]`. However, the output is not matching this expectation.

3. **Correcting the Logic**:
   Upon reviewing the requirements again, I realize that I need to ensure that I am correctly generating all combinations of sums. The expected output suggests that the order of the sums matters, and I need to ensure that I am capturing all unique combinations.

4. **Revising the Approach**:
   - I need to iterate through each tuple and compute the sums correctly.
   - I should ensure that I am not duplicating combinations and that I am capturing all unique pairs.

5. **Implementing the Corrected Solution**:
   I will revise the implementation to ensure it captures the correct combinations of sums.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple
            if i != j:
                # Create a new tuple with the sums of the respective elements
                new_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][0], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][1])
                # Add the new tuple to the results
                results.append(new_tuple)
    
    # Return the list of results
    return results
```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [prompt] Based on the previous analysis and the insights gained, I will revise the implementation of the `find_combinations` function to ensure it correctly computes the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement.

### Key Points to Address:
1. **Correct Pairing**: For each pair of tuples, we need to compute the sums of the first element of one tuple with the second element of another tuple and vice versa.
2. **Unique Combinations**: We need to ensure that we are capturing all unique combinations without duplicates.

### Revised Approach:
- For each tuple \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \), we will compute:
  - \( (a + d, b + c) \)
- We will store these results in a set to avoid duplicates and then convert it back to a list before returning.

Here is the corrected Python code:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Create a set to store unique results
    results = set()
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):

            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple

                results.add(new_tuple)
    
    # Convert the set back to a list and return
    return list(results)
```

This implementation should now correctly compute the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement, ensuring that all unique combinations are captured.

    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations
    Part: 1/1
    # Generating all $K$-combinations

    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.
    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.
    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.

    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label="Generate next lexicographical K-combination"}

    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.
    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how
    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our
    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once
    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent
    elements.

    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}
    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {
        int k = (int)a.size();
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {
                a[i]++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)
                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    ```

    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label="Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element"}

    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such
    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.

    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):
    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.

    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:
    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.
    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the
    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove
    a number, add a number).

    Let us prove this:

    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can 
    be obtained as follows:

    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \cup 1G(N-1)^\text{R}$$

    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the 
    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and
    concatenate these two sequences.

    Now we may produce our proof.

    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note
    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As
    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.
    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.

    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.

    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.

    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size
    $K$.

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}
    int gray_code (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }

    int count_bits (int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (; n; n >>= 1)
            res += n & 1;
        return res;
    }

    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            int cur = gray_code (i);
            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (cur & (1 << j))
                        cout << j + 1;
                }
                cout << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus
    works in $O\left(N \cdot \binom{N}{K}\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant
    than the previous solution.

    The implementation is derived from the formula:

    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\text{R}$$

    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the
    subsequence from appropriate elements.

    Its implementation is as follows:

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}
    vector<int> ans;

    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {
        if (k > n || k < 0)
            return;

        if (!n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {
                if (ans[i])
                    cout << i + 1;
            }
            cout << "\n";
            return;
        }

        ans[idx] = rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);
        ans[idx] = !rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);
    }

    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {
        ans.resize(n);
        gen(n, k, 0, false);
    }
    ```

    Part: 1/2
    \chapter{Combinatorics}

    \index{combinatorics}

    \key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting
    combinations of objects.
    Usually, the goal is to find a way to
    count the combinations efficiently
    without generating each combination separately.

    As an example, consider the problem
    of counting the number of ways to
    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.
    For example, there are 8 representations
    for $4$:
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1+1+1+1$
    \item $1+1+2$
    \item $1+2+1$
    \item $2+1+1$
    \item $2+2$
    \item $3+1$
    \item $1+3$
    \item $4$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}

    A combinatorial problem can often be solved
    using a recursive function.
    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$
    that gives the number of representations for $n$.
    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.
    The values of the function
    can be recursively calculated as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        f(n) = \begin{cases}
                   1               & n = 0\\
                   f(0)+f(1)+\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case is $f(0)=1$,
    because the empty sum represents the number 0.
    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to
    choose the first number of the sum.
    If the first number is $k$,
    there are $f(n-k)$ representations
    for the remaining part of the sum.
    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values
    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.

    The first values for the function are:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    f(0) & = & 1 \\
    f(1) & = & 1 \\
    f(2) & = & 2 \\
    f(3) & = & 4 \\
    f(4) & = & 8 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced
    with a closed-form formula.
    In this problem,
    \[
    f(n)=2^{n-1},
    \]
    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$
    possible positions for +-signs in the sum
    and we can choose any subset of them.

    \section{Binomial coefficients}

    \index{binomial coefficient}

    The \key{binomial coefficient} ${n \choose k}$
    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset
    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.
    For example, ${5 \choose 3}=10$,
    because the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:
    \[ \{1,2,3\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,2,5\}, \{1,3,4\}, \{1,3,5\}, 
    \{1,4,5\}, \{2,3,4\}, \{2,3,5\}, \{2,4,5\}, \{3,4,5\} \]

    \subsubsection{Formula 1}

    Binomial coefficients can be
    recursively calculated as follows:

    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}
    \]

    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.
    If $x$ is included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k-1$
    elements from $n-1$ elements,
    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.

    The base cases for the recursion are
    \[
    {n \choose 0}  =  {n \choose n} = 1,
    \]
    because there is always exactly
    one way to construct an empty subset
    and a subset that contains all the elements.

    \subsubsection{Formula 2}

    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.
    \]

    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.
    We go through all permutations and always
    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation
    in the subset.
    Since the order of the elements in the subset
    and outside the subset does not matter,
    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$

    \subsubsection{Properties}

    For binomial coefficients,
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n \choose n-k},
    \]
    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into
    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements
    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.

    The sum of binomial coefficients is
    \[
    {n \choose 0}+{n \choose 1}+{n \choose 2}+\ldots+{n \choose n}=2^n.
    \]

    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''
    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to
    the $n$th power:

    \[ (a+b)^n =
    {n \choose 0} a^n b^0 + 
    {n \choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +
    \ldots + 
    {n \choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +
    {n \choose n} a^0 b^n. \]

    Binomial coefficients also appear in
    \key{Pascal's triangle}
    where each value equals the sum of two
    above values:

    \subsubsection{Boxes and balls}

    ''Boxes and balls'' is a useful model,
    where we count the ways to
    place $k$ balls in $n$ boxes.
    Let us consider three scenarios:

    \textit{Scenario 1}: Each box can contain
    at most one ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 10 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --
                        (#1+0.5,#2-0.5) -- (#1+0.5,#2+0.5);
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{
        \lax{#1}{#2}{#3}
        \lax{#1+1.2}{#2}{#4}
        \lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}
        \lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}
        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{-4}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    In this scenario, the answer is directly the
    binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 2}: A box can contain multiple balls.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 15 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --

    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{

    }

    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-8}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{0}

    \laa{8}{-6}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{-8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}

    \end{center}

    The process of placing the balls in the boxes
    can be represented as a string
    that consists of symbols
    ''o'' and ''$\rightarrow$''.
    Initially, assume that we are standing at the leftmost box.
    The symbol ''o'' means that we place a ball
    in the current box, and the symbol
    ''$\rightarrow$'' means that we move to
    the next box to the right.

    Using this notation, each solution is a string
    that contains $k$ times the symbol ''o'' and
    $n-1$ times the symbol ''$\rightarrow$''.
    For example, the upper-right solution
    in the above picture corresponds to the string
    ''$\rightarrow$ $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$''.
    Thus, the number of solutions is
    ${k+n-1 \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 3}: Each box may contain at most one ball,
    and in addition, no two adjacent boxes may both contain a ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2

    \section{Knapsack problems}

    \index{knapsack}

    The term \key{knapsack} refers to problems where
    a set of objects is given, and 
    subsets with some properties
    have to be found.
    Knapsack problems can often be solved
    using dynamic programming.

    In this section, we focus on the following
    problem: Given a list of weights
    $[w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n]$,
    determine all
    sums that can be constructed using the weights.
    For example, if the weights are
    $[1,3,3,5]$, the following sums are possible:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    In this case, all sums between $0 \ldots 12$
    are possible, except 2 and 10.
    For example, the sum 7 is possible because we
    can select the weights $[1,3,3]$.

    To solve the problem, we focus on subproblems
    where we only use the first $k$ weights
    to construct sums.
    Let $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{true}$ if
    we can construct a sum $x$
    using the first $k$ weights,
    and otherwise $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{false}$.
    The values of the function can be recursively
    calculated as follows:
    \[ \texttt{possible}(x,k) = \texttt{possible}(x-w_k,k-1) \lor \texttt{possible}(x,k-1) \]
    The formula is based on the fact that we can
    either use or not use the weight $w_k$ in the sum.
    If we use $w_k$, the remaining task is to
    form the sum $x-w_k$ using the first $k-1$ weights,
    and if we do not use $w_k$,
    the remaining task is to form the sum $x$
    using the first $k-1$ weights.
    As the base cases,
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{possible}(x,0) = \begin{cases}
                   \textrm{true}    & x = 0\\
                   \textrm{false}   & x \neq 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    because if no weights are used,
    we can only form the sum 0.

    The following table shows all values of the function
    for the weights $[1,3,3,5]$ (the symbol ''X''
    indicates the true values):

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
    $k \backslash x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     0 & X & \\
     1 & X & X \\
     2 & X & X & & X & X \\
     3 & X & X & & X & X & & X & X \\
     4 & X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    After calculating those values, $\texttt{possible}(x,n)$
    tells us whether we can construct a
    sum $x$ using \emph{all} weights.

    Let $W$ denote the total sum of the weights.
    The following $O(nW)$ time
    dynamic programming solution
    corresponds to the recursive function:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0][0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = 0; x <= W; x++) {
            if (x-w[k] >= 0) possible[x][k] |= possible[x-w[k]][k-1];
            possible[x][k] |= possible[x][k-1];
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    However, here is a better implementation that only uses
    a one-dimensional array $\texttt{possible}[x]$
    that indicates whether we can construct a subset with sum $x$.
    The trick is to update the array from right to left for
    each new weight:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = W; x >= 0; x--) {
            if (possible[x]) possible[x+w[k]] = true;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that the general idea presented here can be used
    in many knapsack problems.
    For example, if we are given objects with weights and values,
    we can determine for each weight sum the maximum value
    sum of a subset.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/780 [generation text] Let's revisit the problem and the previous attempts to identify the correct approach to generate the required combinations of sums from the tuples.

### Problem Recap
We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples that represent all possible combinations of sums formed by adding the first element of one tuple to the second element of another tuple, and vice versa.

### Key Observations
1. For each pair of tuples \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \), we need to compute:
   - \( (a + d, b + c) \)
2. We need to ensure that we are not combining the same tuple with itself.
3. The expected output should match the specific order and values given in the problem statement.

### Correct Approach
1. Iterate through each tuple in the list.
2. For each tuple, iterate through all other tuples.
3. For each unique pair of tuples, compute the sums as described.
4. Store the results in a list.
5. Ensure the results are unique and sorted to match the expected output.

### Implementation
Here is the corrected Python code that implements the above logic:

```python
def find_combinations(tuple_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):
        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):
            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple
            if i != j:
                # Create a new tuple with the sums of the respective elements
                new_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][1], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][0])
                # Add the new tuple to the results
                results.append(new_tuple)
    
    # Remove duplicates by converting to a set and back to a list
    results = list(set(results))
    
    # Sort the results to match the expected output order
    results.sort()
    
    # Return the list of results
    return results
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We create an empty list `results` to store the combinations.
- We use nested loops to iterate through each tuple in the list.
- We check that we are not combining the same tuple with itself.
- We compute the new tuple based on the specified sums and append it to the results.
- We convert the results to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list.
- Finally, we sort the results to ensure they are in the expected order before returning.

This implementation should now correctly compute the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement.
