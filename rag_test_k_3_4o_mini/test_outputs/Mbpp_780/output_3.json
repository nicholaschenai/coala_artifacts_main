    "raw_msg": "Let's revisit the problem and the previous attempts to identify the correct approach to generate the required combinations of sums from the tuples.\n\n### Problem Recap\nWe need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples that represent all possible combinations of sums formed by adding the first element of one tuple to the second element of another tuple, and vice versa.\n\n### Key Observations\n1. For each pair of tuples \\( (a, b) \\) and \\( (c, d) \\), we need to compute:\n   - \\( (a + d, b + c) \\)\n2. We need to ensure that we are not combining the same tuple with itself.\n3. The expected output should match the specific order and values given in the problem statement.\n\n### Correct Approach\n1. Iterate through each tuple in the list.\n2. For each tuple, iterate through all other tuples.\n3. For each unique pair of tuples, compute the sums as described.\n4. Store the results in a list.\n5. Ensure the results are unique and sorted to match the expected output.\n\n### Implementation\nHere is the corrected Python code that implements the above logic:\n\n```python\ndef find_combinations(tuple_list):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):\n        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):\n            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple\n            if i != j:\n                # Create a new tuple with the sums of the respective elements\n                new_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][1], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][0])\n                # Add the new tuple to the results\n                results.append(new_tuple)\n    \n    # Remove duplicates by converting to a set and back to a list\n    results = list(set(results))\n    \n    # Sort the results to match the expected output order\n    results.sort()\n    \n    # Return the list of results\n    return results\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- We create an empty list `results` to store the combinations.\n- We use nested loops to iterate through each tuple in the list.\n- We check that we are not combining the same tuple with itself.\n- We compute the new tuple based on the specified sums and append it to the results.\n- We convert the results to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list.\n- Finally, we sort the results to ensure they are in the expected order before returning.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly compute the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement.",
