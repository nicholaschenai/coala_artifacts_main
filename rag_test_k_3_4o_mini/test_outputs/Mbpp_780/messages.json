Each point $p_i$ is defined by its coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$. It is required to find among them two such points, such that the distance between them is minimal:\n\n    $$ \\min_{\\scriptstyle i, j=0 \\ldots n-1,\\atop \\scriptstyle i \\neq j } \\rho (p_i, p_j). $$\n\n    We take the usual Euclidean distances:\n\n    $$ \\rho (p_i,p_j) = \\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2} .$$\n\n    The trivial algorithm - iterating over all pairs and calculating the distance for each \u2014 works in $O(n^2)$. \n\n    The algorithm running in time $O(n \\log n)$ is described below. This algorithm was proposed by Shamos and Hoey in 1975. (Source: Ch. 5 Notes of _Algorithm Design_ by Kleinberg & Tardos, also see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4567872)) Preparata and Shamos also showed that this algorithm is optimal in the decision tree model.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n    We construct an algorithm according to the general scheme of **divide-and-conquer** algorithms: the algorithm is designed as a recursive function, to which we pass a set of points; this recursive function splits this set in half, calls itself recursively on each half, and then performs some operations to combine the answers. The operation of combining consist of  detecting the cases when one point of the optimal solution fell into one half, and the other point into the other (in this case, recursive calls from each of the halves cannot detect this pair separately). The main difficulty, as always in case of divide and conquer algorithms, lies in the effective implementation of the merging stage. If a set of $n$ points is passed to the recursive function, then the merge stage should work no more than $O(n)$, then the asymptotics of the whole algorithm $T(n)$ will be found from the equation:\n\n    $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).$$ \n\n    The solution to this equation, as is known, is $T(n) = O(n \\log n).$\n\n    So, we proceed on to the construction of the algorithm. In order to come to an effective implementation of the merge stage in the future, we will divide the set of points into two subsets, according to their $x$-coordinates: In fact, we draw some vertical line dividing the set of points into two subsets of approximately the same size. It is convenient to make such a partition as follows: We sort the points in the standard way as pairs of numbers, ie.:\n\n    $$p_i < p_j \\Longleftrightarrow (x_i < x_j) \\lor \\Big(\\left(x_i = x_j\\right) \\wedge \\left(y_i < y_j \\right) \\Big) $$\n\n    Then take the middle point after sorting $p_m (m = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor)$, and all the points before it and the $p_m$ itself are assigned to the first half, and all the points after it - to the second half:\n\n    $$A_1 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = 0 \\ldots m \\}$$\n\n    $$A_2 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = m + 1 \\ldots n-1 \\}.$$ \n\n    Now, calling recursively on each of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, we will find the answers $h_1$ and $h_2$ for each of the halves. And take the best of them: $h = \\min(h_1, h_2)$.\n\n    Now we need to make a **merge stage**, i.e. we try to find such pairs of points, for which the distance between which is less than $h$ and one point is lying in $A_1$ and the other in $A_2$.\n    It is obvious that it is sufficient to consider only those points that are separated from the vertical line by a distance less than $h$, i.e. the set $B$ of the points considered at this stage is equal to:\n\n    $$B = \\{ p_i\\ | \\ | x_i - x_m\\ | < h \\}.$$ \n\n    For each point in the set $B$, we try to find the points that are closer to it than $h$. For example, it is sufficient to consider only those points whose $y$-coordinate differs by no more than $h$. Moreover, it makes no sense to consider those points whose $y$-coordinate is greater than the $y$-coordinate of the current point. Thus, for each point $p_i$ we define the set of considered points $C(p_i)$ as follows:\n\n    $$C(p_i) = \\{ p_j\\ |\\ p_j \\in B,\\ \\ y_i - h < y_j \\le y_i \\}.$$\n\n    If we sort the points of the set $B$ by $y$-coordinate, it will be very easy to find $C(p_i)$: these are several points in a row ahead to the point $p_i$.\n\n    So, in the new notation, the **merging stage** looks like this: build a set $B$, sort the points in it by $y$-coordinate, then for each point $p_i \\in B$ consider all points $p_j \\in C(p_i)$, and for each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ calculate the distance and compare with the current best distance.\n\n    At first glance, this is still a non-optimal algorithm: it seems that the sizes of sets $C(p_i)$ will be of order $n$, and the required asymptotics will not work. However, surprisingly, it can be proved that the size of each of the sets $C(p_i)$ is a quantity $O(1)$, i.e. it does not exceed some small constant regardless of the points themselves. Proof of this fact is given in the next section.\n\n    Finally, we pay attention to the sorting, which the above algorithm contains: first,sorting by pairs $(x, y)$, and then second, sorting the elements of the set $B$ by $y$. In fact, both of these sorts inside the recursive function can be eliminated (otherwise we would not reach the $O(n)$ estimate for the **merging stage**, and the general asymptotics of the algorithm would be $O(n \\log^2 n)$). It is easy to get rid of the first sort \u2014 it is enough to perform this sort before starting the recursion: after all, the elements themselves do not change inside the recursion, so there is no need to sort again. With the second sorting a little more difficult to perform, performing it previously will not work. But, remembering the merge sort, which also works on the principle of divide-and-conquer, we can simply embed this sort in our recursion. Let recursion, taking some set of points (as we remember,ordered by pairs $(x, y)$), return the same set, but sorted by the $y$-coordinate. To do this, simply merge (in $O(n)$) the two results returned by recursive calls. This will result in a set sorted by $y$-coordinate.\n\n    ## Evaluation of the asymptotics\n\n    To show that the above algorithm is actually executed in $O(n \\log n)$, we need to prove the following fact: $|C(p_i)| = O(1)$.\n\n    So, let us consider some point $p_i$; recall that the set $C(p_i)$ is a set of points whose $y$-coordinate lies in the segment $[y_i-h; y_i]$, and, moreover, along the $x$ coordinate, the point $p_i$ itself, and all the points of the set $C(p_i)$ lie in the band width $2h$. In other words, the points we are considering $p_i$ and $C(p_i)$ lie in a rectangle of size $2h \\times h$.\n\n    Our task is to estimate the maximum number of points that can lie in this rectangle $2h \\times h$; thus, we estimate the maximum size of the set $C(p_i)$. At the same time, when evaluating, we must not forget that there may be repeated points.\n\n    Remember that $h$ was obtained from the results of two recursive calls \u2014 on sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ contains points to the left of the partition line and partially on it, $A_2$ contains the remaining points of the partition line and points to the right of it. For any pair of points from $A_1$, as well as from $A_2$, the distance can not be less than $h$ \u2014 otherwise it would mean incorrect operation of the recursive function.\n\n    To estimate the maximum number of points in the rectangle $2h \\times h$ we divide it into two squares $h \\times h$, the first square include all points $C(p_i) \\cap A_1$, and the second contains all the others, i.e. $C(p_i) \\cap A_2$. It follows from the above considerations that in each of these squares the distance between any two points is at least $h$.\n\n    We show that there are at most four points in each square. For example, this can be done as follows: divide the square into $4$ sub-squares with sides $h/2$. Then there can be no more than one point in each of these sub-squares (since even the diagonal is equal to $h / \\sqrt{2}$, which is less than $h$). Therefore, there can be no more than $4$ points in the whole square.\n\n    So, we have proved that in a rectangle $2h \\times h$ can not be more than $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ points, and, therefore, the size of the set $C(p_i)$ cannot exceed $7$, as required.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Generating all $K$-combinations\n\n    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.\n    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.\n    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.\n\n    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label=\"Generate next lexicographical K-combination\"}\n\n    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.\n    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how\n    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our\n    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once\n    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent\n    elements.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}\n    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {\n        int k = (int)a.size();\n        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {\n                a[i]++;\n                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)\n                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label=\"Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element\"}\n\n    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such\n    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.\n\n    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):\n    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.\n\n    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:\n    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.\n    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the\n    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove\n    a number, add a number).\n\n    Let us prove this:\n\n    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can \n    be obtained as follows:\n\n    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \\cup 1G(N-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the \n    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and\n    concatenate these two sequences.\n\n    Now we may produce our proof.\n\n    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note\n    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As\n    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.\n    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.\n\n    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.\n\n    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.\n\n    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size\n    $K$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}\n    int gray_code (int n) {\n        return n ^ (n >> 1);\n    }\n\n    int count_bits (int n) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (; n; n >>= 1)\n            res += n & 1;\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {\n            int cur = gray_code (i);\n            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (cur & (1 << j))\n                        cout << j + 1;\n                }\n                cout << \"\\n\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus\n    works in $O\\left(N \\cdot \\binom{N}{K}\\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant\n    than the previous solution.\n\n    The implementation is derived from the formula:\n\n    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \\cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the\n    subsequence from appropriate elements.\n\n    Its implementation is as follows:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}\n    vector<int> ans;\n\n    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {\n        if (k > n || k < 0)\n            return;\n\n        if (!n) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {\n                if (ans[i])\n                    cout << i + 1;\n            }\n            cout << \"\\n\";\n            return;\n        }\n\n        ans[idx] = rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);\n        ans[idx] = !rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {\n        ans.resize(n);\n        gen(n, k, 0, false);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

We need to ensure that we do not repeat any combinations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_combinations(tuple_list):\n       create an empty list for results\n       for each tuple i in tuple_list:\n           for each tuple j in tuple_list:\n               if i is not the same as j:\n                   create a new tuple with (i[0] + j[1], i[1] + j[0])\n                   add this new tuple to results\n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_combinations(tuple_list):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):\n        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):\n            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple\n            if i != j:\n                # Create a new tuple with the sums of the respective elements\n                new_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][1], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][0])\n                # Add the new tuple to the results\n                results.append(new_tuple)\n    \n    # Return the list of results\n    return results\n```"

problems}\n\n    \\index{knapsack}\n\n    The term \\key{knapsack} refers to problems where\n    a set of objects is given, and \n    subsets with some properties\n    have to be found.\n    Knapsack problems can often be solved\n    using dynamic programming.\n\n    In this section, we focus on the following\n    problem: Given a list of weights\n    $[w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_n]$,\n    determine all\n    sums that can be constructed using the weights.\n    For example, if the weights are\n    $[1,3,3,5]$, the following sums are possible:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrrrrr}\n     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\\n    \\hline\n     X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    In this case, all sums between $0 \\ldots 12$\n    are possible, except 2 and 10.\n    For example, the sum 7 is possible because we\n    can select the weights $[1,3,3]$.\n\n    To solve the problem, we focus on subproblems\n    where we only use the first $k$ weights\n    to construct sums.\n    Let $\\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\\textrm{true}$ if\n    we can construct a sum $x$\n    using the first $k$ weights,\n    and otherwise $\\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\\textrm{false}$.\n    The values of the function can be recursively\n    calculated as follows:\n    \\[ \\texttt{possible}(x,k) = \\texttt{possible}(x-w_k,k-1) \\lor \\texttt{possible}(x,k-1) \\]\n    The formula is based on the fact that we can\n    either use or not use the weight $w_k$ in the sum.\n    If we use $w_k$, the remaining task is to\n    form the sum $x-w_k$ using the first $k-1$ weights,\n    and if we do not use $w_k$,\n    the remaining task is to form the sum $x$\n    using the first $k-1$ weights.\n    As the base cases,\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\texttt{possible}(x,0) = \\begin{cases}\n                   \\textrm{true}    & x = 0\\\\\n                   \\textrm{false}   & x \\neq 0 \\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    because if no weights are used,\n    we can only form the sum 0.\n\n    The following table shows all values of the function\n    for the weights $[1,3,3,5]$ (the symbol ''X''\n    indicates the true values):\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrrrrrrr}\n    $k \\backslash x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\\n    \\hline\n     0 & X & \\\\\n     1 & X & X \\\\\n     2 & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n     3 & X & X & & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n     4 & X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    After calculating those values, $\\texttt{possible}(x,n)$\n    tells us whether we can construct a\n    sum $x$ using \\emph{all} weights.\n\n    Let $W$ denote the total sum of the weights.\n    The following $O(nW)$ time\n    dynamic programming solution\n    corresponds to the recursive function:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    possible[0][0] = true;\n    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {\n        for (int x = 0; x <= W; x++) {\n            if (x-w[k] >= 0) possible[x][k] |= possible[x-w[k]][k-1];\n            possible[x][k] |= possible[x][k-1];\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    However, here is a better implementation that only uses\n    a one-dimensional array $\\texttt{possible}[x]$\n    that indicates whether we can construct a subset with sum $x$.\n    The trick is to update the array from right to left for\n    each new weight:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    possible[0] = true;\n    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {\n        for (int x = W; x >= 0; x--) {\n            if (possible[x]) possible[x+w[k]] = true;\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Note that the general idea presented here can be used\n    in many knapsack problems.\n    For example, if we are given objects with weights and values,\n    we can determine for each weight sum the maximum value\n    sum of a

Once\n    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent\n    elements.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}\n    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {\n        int k = (int)a.size();\n        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {\n                a[i]++;\n                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)\n                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label=\"Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element\"}\n\n    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such\n    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.\n\n    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):\n    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.\n\n    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:\n    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.\n    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the\n    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove\n    a number, add a number).\n\n    Let us prove this:\n\n    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can \n    be obtained as follows:\n\n    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \\cup 1G(N-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the \n    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and\n    concatenate these two sequences.\n\n    Now we may produce our proof.\n\n    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note\n    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As\n    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.\n    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.\n\n    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.\n\n    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.\n\n    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size\n    $K$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}\n    int gray_code (int n) {\n        return n ^ (n >> 1);\n    }\n\n    int count_bits (int n) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (; n; n >>= 1)\n            res += n & 1;\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {\n            int cur = gray_code (i);\n            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (cur & (1 << j))\n                        cout << j + 1;\n                }\n                cout << \"\\n\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus\n    works in $O\\left(N \\cdot \\binom{N}{K}\\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant\n    than the previous solution.\n\n    The implementation is derived from the formula:\n\n    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \\cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the\n    subsequence from appropriate elements.\n\n    Its implementation is as follows:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}\n    vector<int> ans;\n\n    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {\n        if (k > n || k < 0)\n            return;\n\n        if (!n) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {\n                if (ans[i])\n                    cout << i

methods for counting\n    combinations of objects.\n    Usually, the goal is to find a way to\n    count the combinations efficiently\n    without generating each combination separately.\n\n    As an example, consider the problem\n    of counting the number of ways to\n    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.\n    For example, there are 8 representations\n    for $4$:\n    \\begin{multicols}{2}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $1+1+1+1$\n    \\item $1+1+2$\n    \\item $1+2+1$\n    \\item $2+1+1$\n    \\item $2+2$\n    \\item $3+1$\n    \\item $1+3$\n    \\item $4$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{multicols}\n\n    A combinatorial problem can often be solved\n    using a recursive function.\n    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$\n    that gives the number of representations for $n$.\n    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.\n    The values of the function\n    can be recursively calculated as follows:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n                   1               & n = 0\\\\\n                   f(0)+f(1)+\\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case is $f(0)=1$,\n    because the empty sum represents the number 0.\n    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to\n    choose the first number of the sum.\n    If the first number is $k$,\n    there are $f(n-k)$ representations\n    for the remaining part of the sum.\n    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values\n    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.\n\n    The first values for the function are:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    f(0) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    f(3) & = & 4 \\\\\n    f(4) & = & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced\n    with a closed-form formula.\n    In this problem,\n    \\[\n    f(n)=2^{n-1},\n    \\]\n    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$\n    possible positions for +-signs in the sum\n    and we can choose any subset of them.\n\n    \\section{Binomial coefficients}\n\n    \\index{binomial coefficient}\n\n    The \\key{binomial coefficient} ${n \\choose k}$\n    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset\n    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, ${5 \\choose 3}=10$,\n    because the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:\n    \\[ \\{1,2,3\\}, \\{1,2,4\\}, \\{1,2,5\\}, \\{1,3,4\\}, \\{1,3,5\\}, \n    \\{1,4,5\\}, \\{2,3,4\\}, \\{2,3,5\\}, \\{2,4,5\\}, \\{3,4,5\\} \\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 1}\n\n    Binomial coefficients can be\n    recursively calculated as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k}\n    \\]\n\n    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.\n    If $x$ is included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k-1$\n    elements from $n-1$ elements,\n    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.\n\n    The base cases for the recursion are\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}  =  {n \\choose n} = 1,\n    \\]\n    because there is always exactly\n    one way to construct an empty subset\n    and a subset that contains all the elements.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 2}\n\n    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\n    \\]\n\n    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.\n    We go through all permutations and always\n    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation\n    in the subset.\n    Since the order of the elements in the subset\n    and outside the subset does not matter,\n    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$\n\n    \\subsubsection{Properties}\n\n    For binomial coefficients,\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n \\choose n-k},\n    \\]\n    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into\n    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements\n    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.\n\n    The sum of binomial coefficients is\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}+{n \\choose 1}+{n \\choose 2}+\\ldots+{n \\choose n}=2^n.\n    \\]\n\n    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''\n    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to\n    the $n$th power:\n\n    \\[ (a+b)^n =\n    {n \\choose 0} a^n b^0 + \n    {n \\choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +\n    \\ldots + \n    {n \\choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +\n    {n \\choose n} a^0 b^n. \\]\n\n    \\index{Pascal's triangle}\n\n    Binomial coefficients also appear

Dynamic programming\n    Section: Knapsack problems\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Knapsack problems}\n\n    \\index{knapsack}\n\n    The term \\key{knapsack} refers to problems where\n    a set of objects is given, and \n    subsets with some properties\n    have to be found.\n    Knapsack problems can often be solved\n    using dynamic programming.\n\n    In this section, we focus on the following\n    problem: Given a list of weights\n    $[w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_n]$,\n    determine all\n    sums that can be constructed using the weights.\n    For example, if the weights are\n    $[1,3,3,5]$, the following sums are possible:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrrrrr}\n     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\\n    \\hline\n     X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    In this case, all sums between $0 \\ldots 12$\n    are possible, except 2 and 10.\n    For example, the sum 7 is possible because we\n    can select the weights $[1,3,3]$.\n\n    To solve the problem, we focus on subproblems\n    where we only use the first $k$ weights\n    to construct sums.\n    Let $\\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\\textrm{true}$ if\n    we can construct a sum $x$\n    using the first $k$ weights,\n    and otherwise $\\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\\textrm{false}$.\n    The values of the function can be recursively\n    calculated as follows:\n    \\[ \\texttt{possible}(x,k) = \\texttt{possible}(x-w_k,k-1) \\lor \\texttt{possible}(x,k-1) \\]\n    The formula is based on the fact that we can\n    either use or not use the weight $w_k$ in the sum.\n    If we use $w_k$, the remaining task is to\n    form the sum $x-w_k$ using the first $k-1$ weights,\n    and if we do not use $w_k$,\n    the remaining task is to form the sum $x$\n    using the first $k-1$ weights.\n    As the base cases,\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\texttt{possible}(x,0) = \\begin{cases}\n                   \\textrm{true}    & x = 0\\\\\n                   \\textrm{false}   & x \\neq 0 \\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    because if no weights are used,\n    we can only form the sum 0.\n\n    The following table shows all values of the function\n    for the weights $[1,3,3,5]$ (the symbol ''X''\n    indicates the true values):\n\n    \\begin{center}\n

$\\texttt{possible}(x,n)$\n    tells us whether we can construct a\n    sum $x$ using \\emph{all} weights.\n\n    Let $W$ denote the total sum of the weights.\n    The following $O(nW)$ time\n    dynamic programming solution\n    corresponds to the recursive function:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    possible[0][0] = true;\n    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {\n        for (int x = 0; x <= W; x++)

The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how\n    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our\n    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once\n    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent\n    elements.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}\n    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {\n        int k = (int)a.size();\n        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {\n                a[i]++;\n                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)\n                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label=\"Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element\"}\n\n    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such\n    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.\n\n    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):\n    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.\n\n    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:\n    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.\n    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the\n    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove\n    a number, add a number).\n\n    Let us prove this:\n\n    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can \n    be obtained as follows:\n\n    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \\cup 1G(N-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the \n    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and\n    concatenate these two sequences.\n\n    Now we may produce our proof.\n\n    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note\n    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As\n    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.\n    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.\n\n    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.\n\n    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.\n\n    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size\n    $K$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}\n    int gray_code (int n) {\n        return n ^ (n >> 1);\n    }\n\n    int count_bits (int n) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (; n; n >>= 1)\n            res += n & 1;\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {\n            int cur = gray_code (i);\n            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (cur & (1 << j))\n                        cout << j + 1;\n                }\n                cout << \"\\n\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus\n    works in $O\\left(N \\cdot \\binom{N}{K}\\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant\n    than the previous solution.\n\n    The implementation is derived from the formula:\n\n    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \\cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the\n    subsequence from appropriate elements.\n\n    Its implementation is as follows:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}\n    vector<int> ans;\n\n    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {\n        if (k > n || k < 0)\n            return;\n\n        if (!n) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {\n                if (ans[i])\n                    cout << i

methods for counting\n    combinations of objects.\n    Usually, the goal is to find a way to\n    count the combinations efficiently\n    without generating each combination separately.\n\n    As an example, consider the problem\n    of counting the number of ways to\n    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.\n    For example, there are 8 representations\n    for $4$:\n    \\begin{multicols}{2}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $1+1+1+1$\n    \\item $1+1+2$\n    \\item $1+2+1$\n    \\item $2+1+1$\n    \\item $2+2$\n    \\item $3+1$\n    \\item $1+3$\n    \\item $4$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{multicols}\n\n    A combinatorial problem can often be solved\n    using a recursive function.\n    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$\n    that gives the number of representations for $n$.\n    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.\n    The values of the function\n    can be recursively calculated as follows:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n                   1               & n = 0\\\\\n                   f(0)+f(1)+\\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case is $f(0)=1$,\n    because the empty sum represents the number 0.\n    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to\n    choose the first number of the sum.\n    If the first number is $k$,\n    there are $f(n-k)$ representations\n    for the remaining part of the sum.\n    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values\n    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.\n\n    The first values for the function are:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    f(0) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    f(3) & = & 4 \\\\\n    f(4) & = & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced\n    with a closed-form formula.\n    In this problem,\n    \\[\n    f(n)=2^{n-1},\n    \\]\n    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$\n    possible positions for +-signs in the sum\n    and we can choose any subset of them.\n\n    \\section{Binomial coefficients}\n\n    \\index{binomial coefficient}\n\n    The \\key{binomial coefficient} ${n \\choose k}$\n    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset\n    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, ${5 \\choose 3}=10$,\n    because the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:\n    \\[ \\{1,2,3\\}, \\{1,2,4\\}, \\{1,2,5\\}, \\{1,3,4\\}, \\{1,3,5\\}, \n    \\{1,4,5\\}, \\{2,3,4\\}, \\{2,3,5\\}, \\{2,4,5\\}, \\{3,4,5\\} \\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 1}\n\n    Binomial coefficients can be\n    recursively calculated as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k}\n    \\]\n\n    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.\n    If $x$ is included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k-1$\n    elements from $n-1$ elements,\n    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.\n\n    The base cases for the recursion are\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}  =  {n \\choose n} = 1,\n    \\]\n    because there is always exactly\n    one way to construct an empty subset\n    and a subset that contains all the elements.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 2}\n\n    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\n    \\]\n\n    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.\n    We go through all permutations and always\n    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation\n    in the subset.\n    Since the order of the elements in the subset\n    and outside the subset does not matter,\n    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$\n\n    \\subsubsection{Properties}\n\n    For binomial coefficients,\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n \\choose n-k},\n    \\]\n    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into\n    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements\n    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.\n\n    The sum of binomial coefficients is\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}+{n \\choose 1}+{n \\choose 2}+\\ldots+{n \\choose n}=2^n.\n    \\]\n\n    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''\n    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to\n    the $n$th power:\n\n    \\[ (a+b)^n =\n    {n \\choose 0} a^n b^0 + \n    {n \\choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +\n    \\ldots + \n    {n \\choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +\n    {n \\choose n} a^0 b^n. \\]\n\n    \\index{Pascal's triangle}\n\n    Binomial coefficients also appear

can be represented as a string\n    that consists of symbols\n    ''o'' and ''$\\rightarrow$''.\n    Initially, assume that we are standing at the leftmost box.\n    The symbol ''o'' means that we place a ball\n    in the current box, and the symbol\n    ''$\\rightarrow$'' means that we move to\n    the next box to the right.\n\n    Using this notation, each solution is a string\n    that contains $k$ times the symbol ''o'' and\n    $n-1$ times the symbol ''$\\rightarrow$''.\n    For example, the upper-right solution\n    in the above picture corresponds to the string\n    ''$\\rightarrow$ $\\rightarrow$ o $\\rightarrow$ o $\\rightarrow$''.\n    Thus, the number of solutions is\n    ${k+n-1 \\choose k}$.\n\n    \\textit{Scenario 3}: Each box may contain at most one

Dynamic programming\n    Section: Knapsack problems\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Knapsack problems}\n\n    \\index{knapsack}\n\n    The term \\key{knapsack} refers to problems where\n    a set of objects is given, and \n    subsets with some properties\n    have to be found.\n    Knapsack problems can often be solved\n    using dynamic programming.\n\n    In this section, we focus on the following\n    problem: Given a list of weights\n    $[w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_n]$,\n    determine all\n    sums that can be constructed using the weights.\n    For example, if the weights are\n    $[1,3,3,5]$, the following sums are possible:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrrrrr}\n     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\\n    \\hline\n     X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    In this case, all sums between $0 \\ldots 12$\n    are possible, except 2 and 10.\n    For example, the sum 7 is possible because we\n    can select the weights $[1,3,3]$.\n\n    To solve the problem, we focus on subproblems\n    where we only use the first $k$ weights\n    to construct sums.\n    Let $\\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\\textrm{true}$ if\n    we can construct a sum $x$\n    using the first $k$ weights,\n    and otherwise $\\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\\textrm{false}$.\n    The values of the function can be recursively\n    calculated as follows:\n    \\[ \\texttt{possible}(x,k) = \\texttt{possible}(x-w_k,k-1) \\lor \\texttt{possible}(x,k-1) \\]\n    The formula is based on the fact that we can\n    either use or not use the weight $w_k$ in the sum.\n    If we use $w_k$, the remaining task is to\n    form the sum $x-w_k$ using the first $k-1$ weights,\n    and if we do not use $w_k$,\n    the remaining task is to form the sum $x$\n    using the first $k-1$ weights.\n    As the base cases,\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\texttt{possible}(x,0) = \\begin{cases}\n                   \\textrm{true}    & x = 0\\\\\n                   \\textrm{false}   & x \\neq 0 \\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    because if no weights are used,\n    we can only form the sum 0.\n\n    The following table shows all values of the function\n    for the weights $[1,3,3,5]$ (the symbol ''X''\n    indicates the true values):\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrrrrrrr}\n    $k \\backslash x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\\n    \\hline\n     0 & X & \\\\\n     1 & X & X \\\\\n     2 & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n     3 & X & X & & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n     4 & X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    After calculating those values, $\\texttt{possible}(x,n)$\n    tells us whether we can construct a\n    sum $x$ using \\emph{all} weights.\n\n    Let $W$ denote the total sum of the weights.\n    The following $O(nW)$ time\n    dynamic programming solution\n    corresponds to the recursive function:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    possible[0][0] = true;\n    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {\n        for (int x = 0; x <= W; x++) {\n            if (x-w[k] >= 0) possible[x][k] |= possible[x-w[k]][k-1];\n            possible[x][k] |= possible[x][k-1];\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    However, here is a better implementation that only uses\n    a one-dimensional array $\\texttt{possible}[x]$\n    that indicates whether we can construct a subset with sum $x$.\n    The trick is to update the array from right to left for\n    each new weight:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    possible[0] = true;\n    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {\n        for (int x = W; x >= 0; x--) {\n            if (possible[x]) possible[x+w[k]] = true;\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Note that the general idea presented here can be used\n    in many knapsack problems.\n    For example, if we are given objects with weights and values,\n    we can determine for each weight sum the maximum value\n    sum of a subset.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "Let's revisit the problem and the previous attempts to identify the correct approach to generate the required combinations of sums from the tuples.\n\n### Problem Recap\nWe need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples that represent all possible combinations of sums formed by adding the first element of one tuple to the second element of another tuple, and vice versa.\n\n### Key Observations\n1. For each pair of tuples \\( (a, b) \\) and \\( (c, d) \\), we need to compute:\n   - \\( (a + d, b + c) \\)\n2. We need to ensure that we are not combining the same tuple with itself.\n3. The expected output should match the specific order and values given in the problem statement.\n\n### Correct Approach\n1. Iterate through each tuple in the list.\n2. For each tuple, iterate through all other tuples.\n3. For each unique pair of tuples, compute the sums as described.\n4. Store the results in a list.\n5. Ensure the results are unique and sorted to match the expected output.\n\n### Implementation\nHere is the corrected Python code that implements the above logic:\n\n```python\ndef find_combinations(tuple_list):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):\n        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):\n            # Ensure we are not combining the same tuple\n            if i != j:\n                # Create a new tuple with the sums of the respective elements\n                new_tuple = (tuple_list[i][0] + tuple_list[j][1], tuple_list[i][1] + tuple_list[j][0])\n                # Add the new tuple to the results\n                results.append(new_tuple)\n    \n    # Remove duplicates by converting to a set and back to a list\n    results = list(set(results))\n    \n    # Sort the results to match the expected output order\n    results.sort()\n    \n    # Return the list of results\n    return results\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- We create an empty list `results` to store the combinations.\n- We use nested loops to iterate through each tuple in the list.\n- We check that we are not combining the same tuple with itself.\n- We compute the new tuple based on the specified sums and append it to the results.\n- We convert the results to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list.\n- Finally, we sort the results to ensure they are in the expected order before returning.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly compute the combinations of sums as specified in the problem statement."
