    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the surface area of a cube given the length of one of its sides. The surface area of a cube can be determined using a specific formula.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: A cube has six faces, and each face is a square. The area of one square face can be calculated by squaring the length of the side of the cube. Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is six times the area of one face.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `surfacearea_cube` that takes one parameter `side_length`.\n   - Calculate the area of one face as `side_length * side_length`.\n   - Multiply the area of one face by 6 to get the total surface area.\n   - Return the total surface area.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the surface area of a cube\ndef surfacearea_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of one face of the cube\n    face_area = side_length * side_length\n    # Calculate the total surface area (6 faces)\n    total_surface_area = 6 * face_area\n    # Return the total surface area\n    return total_surface_area\n```",
