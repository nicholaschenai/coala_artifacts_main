INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/441 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the surface area of a cube given the length of one of its sides. The surface area of a cube is the total area of all six of its square faces.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the surface area of a cube, we can use the formula: 
   Surface Area = 6 * (side length)^2. 
   This is because a cube has six faces, and each face is a square with an area equal to the side length squared.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION surfacearea_cube(side_length):
       Calculate area_of_one_face = side_length * side_length
       Calculate surface_area = 6 * area_of_one_face
       RETURN surface_area
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the surface area of a cube
def surfacearea_cube(side_length):
    # Calculate the area of one face of the cube
    area_of_one_face = side_length * side_length
    # Calculate the total surface area (6 faces)
    surface_area = 6 * area_of_one_face
    # Return the calculated surface area
    return surface_area

    Chapter: Geometry
    Section: Polygon area
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Polygon area}

    A general formula for calculating the area
    of a polygon, sometimes called the \key{shoelace formula},
    is as follows: \index{shoelace formula}
    \[\frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (p_i \times p_{i+1})| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|, \]
    Here the vertices are
    $p_1=(x_1,y_1)$, $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$, $\ldots$, $p_n=(x_n,y_n)$
    in such an order that
    $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ are adjacent vertices on the boundary
    of the polygon,
    and the first and last vertex is the same, i.e., $p_1=p_n$.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is
    \[\frac{|(2\cdot5-5\cdot4)+(5\cdot3-7\cdot5)+(7\cdot1-4\cdot3)+(4\cdot3-4\cdot1)+(4\cdot4-2\cdot3)|}{2} = 17/2.\]

    The idea of the formula is to go through trapezoids
    whose one side is a side of the polygon,
    and another side lies on the horizontal line $y=0$.
    For example:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \path[draw,fill=lightgray] (5,5.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (7,0) -- (5,0) -- (5,5.4);
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \draw (0,0) -- (10,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    The area of such a trapezoid is
    \[(x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2},\]
    where the vertices of the polygon are $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$.
    If $x_{i+1}>x_{i}$, the area is positive,
    and if $x_{i+1}<x_{i}$, the area is negative.

    The area of the polygon is the sum of areas of
    all such trapezoids, which yields the formula
    \[|\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2}| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|.\]

    Note that the absolute value of the sum is taken,
    because the value of the sum may be positive or negative,
    depending on whether we walk clockwise or counterclockwise
    along the boundary of the polygon.

    \subsubsection{Pick's theorem}

    \index{Pick's theorem}

    \key{Pick's theorem} provides another way to calculate
    the area of a polygon provided that all vertices 
    of the polygon have integer coordinates.
    According to Pick's theorem, the area of the polygon is
    \[ a + b/2 -1,\]
    where $a$ is the number of integer points inside the polygon
    and $b$ is the number of integer points on the boundary of the polygon.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};

    Title: Pick's Theorem
    Part: 1/1
    # Pick's Theorem

    A polygon without self-intersections is called lattice if all its vertices have integer coordinates in some 2D grid. Pick's theorem provides a way to compute the area of this polygon through the number of vertices that are lying on the boundary and the number of vertices that lie strictly inside the polygon.

    ## Formula

    Given a certain lattice polygon with non-zero area.

    We denote its area by $S$, the number of points with integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon by $I$ and the number of points lying on polygon sides by $B$.

    Then, the **Pick's formula** states:

    $$S=I+\frac{B}{2}-1$$

    In particular, if the values of $I$ and $B$ for a polygon are given, the area can be calculated in $O(1)$ without even knowing the vertices.

    This formula was discovered and proven by Austrian mathematician Georg Alexander Pick in 1899.

    ## Proof

    The proof is carried out in many stages: from simple polygons to arbitrary ones:

    - A single square: $S=1, I=0, B=4$, which satisfies the formula.

    - An arbitrary non-degenerate rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes: Assume $a$ and $b$ be the length of the sides of rectangle. Then, $S=ab, I=(a-1)(b-1), B=2(a+b)$. On substituting, we see that formula is true.

    - A right angle with legs parallel to the axes: To prove this, note that any such triangle can be obtained by cutting off a rectangle by a diagonal. Denoting the number of integral points lying on diagonal by $c$, it can be shown that Pick's formula holds for this triangle regardless of $c$.

    - An arbitrary triangle: Note that any such triangle can be turned into a rectangle by attaching it to sides of right-angled triangles with legs parallel to the axes (you will not need more than 3 such triangles). From here, we can get correct formula for any triangle.

    - An arbitrary polygon: To prove this, triangulate it, ie, divide into triangles with integral coordinates. Further, it is possible to prove that Pick's theorem retains its validity when a polygon is added to a triangle. Thus, we have proven Pick's formula for arbitrary polygon.

    ## Generalization to higher dimensions

    Unfortunately, this simple and beautiful formula cannot be generalized to higher dimensions.

    John Reeve demonstrated this by proposing a tetrahedron (**Reeve tetrahedron**) with following vertices in 1957:

    $$A=(0,0,0),
    B=(1,0,0),
    C=(0,1,0),
    D=(1,1,k),$$

    where $k$ can be any natural number. Then for any $k$, the tetrahedron $ABCD$ does not contain integer point inside it and has only $4$ points on its borders, $A, B, C, D$. Thus, the volume and surface area may vary in spite of unchanged number of points within and on boundary. Therefore, Pick's theorem doesn't allow generalizations.

    However, higher dimensions still has a generalization using **Ehrhart polynomials** but they are quite complex and depends not only on points inside but also on the boundary of polytype.

    A few simple examples and a simple proof of Pick's theorem can be found [here](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/pick.pdf).

    Title: Finding area of simple polygon in $O(N)$
    Part: 1/1
    # Finding area of simple polygon in $O(N)$

    Let a simple polygon (i.e. without self intersection, not necessarily convex) be given. It is required to calculate its area given its vertices.

    ## Method 1

    This is easy to do if we go through all edges and add trapezoid areas bounded by each edge and x-axis. The area needs to be taken with sign so that the extra area will be reduced. Hence, the formula is as follows:

    $$A = \sum_{(p,q)\in \text{edges}} \frac{(p_x - q_x) \cdot (p_y + q_y)}{2}$$

    Code:

    ```cpp
    double area(const vector<point>& fig) {
        double res = 0;
        for (unsigned i = 0; i < fig.size(); i++) {
            point p = i ? fig[i - 1] : fig.back();
            point q = fig[i];
            res += (p.x - q.x) * (p.y + q.y);
        }
        return fabs(res) / 2;
    }
    ```

    ## Method 2
    We can choose a point $O$ arbitrarily, iterate over all edges adding the oriented area of the triangle formed by the edge and point $O$. Again, due to the sign of area, extra area will be reduced.

    This method is better as it can be generalized to more complex cases (such as when some sides are arcs instead of straight lines)
