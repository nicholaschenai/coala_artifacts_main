    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a Python function that checks whether all elements in a given list are unique. If all elements are unique, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if all elements in the list are unique, we can use a set to track the elements we have seen so far. As we iterate through the list, we will check if each element is already in the set. If it is, we return `False` because that means the element is a duplicate. If we finish checking all elements without finding duplicates, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function all_unique(lst):\n       create an empty set called seen\n       for each element in lst:\n           if element is in seen:\n               return False\n           add element to seen\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef all_unique(lst):\n    # Create an empty set to track seen elements\n    seen = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # If the element is already in the set, it's a duplicate\n        if element in seen:\n            return False\n        # Add the element to the set\n        seen.add(element)\n    \n    # If we finish the loop without finding duplicates, return True\n    return True\n```",
