INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/465 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary as input and removes any key-value pairs where the value is empty. In this context, an empty value is defined as `None`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the dictionary and check each value. If a value is not `None`, we will keep the key-value pair in a new dictionary. Finally, we will return this new dictionary that contains only the non-empty items.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function drop_empty(input_dict):
       create an empty dictionary called result
       for each key-value pair in input_dict:
           if value is not None:
               add key-value pair to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def drop_empty(input_dict):
    # Create an empty dictionary to store non-empty items
    result = {}
    
    # Iterate through each key-value pair in the input dictionary
    for key, value in input_dict.items():
        # Check if the value is not None
        if value is not None:
            # Add the key-value pair to the result dictionary
            result[key] = value
            
    # Return the dictionary containing only non-empty items

    Chapter: Flows and cuts
    Section: Disjoint paths
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Disjoint paths}

    Many graph problems can be solved by reducing
    them to the maximum flow problem.
    Our first example of such a problem is
    as follows: we are given a directed graph
    with a source and a sink,
    and our task is to find the maximum number
    of disjoint paths from the source to the sink.

    \subsubsection{Edge-disjoint paths}

    We will first focus on the problem of
    finding the maximum number of
    \key{edge-disjoint paths} from the source to the sink.
    This means that we should construct a set of paths
    such that each edge appears in at most one path.

    For example, consider the following graph:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (1,2) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (3,3) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (5,3) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (3,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (5,1) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (7,2) {$6$};
    \path[draw,thick,->] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (2) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (5) -- (6);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    In this graph, the maximum number of edge-disjoint
    paths is 2.
    We can choose the paths
    $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 6$
    and $1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 6$ as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (1,2) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (3,3) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (5,3) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (3,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (5,1) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (7,2) {$6$};
    \path[draw,thick,->] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (2) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (5) -- (6);

    \path[draw=green,thick,->,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw=green,thick,->,line width=2pt] (2) -- (4);
    \path[draw=green,thick,->,line width=2pt] (4) -- (3);
    \path[draw=green,thick,->,line width=2pt] (3) -- (6);

    \path[draw=blue,thick,->,line width=2pt] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw=blue,thick,->,line width=2pt] (4) -- (5);
    \path[draw=blue,thick,->,line width=2pt] (5) -- (6);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    It turns out that the maximum number of
    edge-disjoint paths
    equals the maximum flow of the graph,
    assuming that the capacity of each edge is one.
    After the maximum flow has been constructed,
    the edge-disjoint paths can be found greedily
    by following paths from the source to the sink.

    \subsubsection{Node-disjoint paths}

    Let us now consider another problem:
    finding the maximum number of
    \key{node-disjoint paths} from the source
    to the sink.
    In this problem, every node,
    except for the source and sink,
    may appear in at most one path.
    The number of node-disjoint paths
    may be smaller than the number of
    edge-disjoint paths.

    For example, in the previous graph,
    the maximum number of node-disjoint paths is 1:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (1,2) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (3,3) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (5,3) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (3,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (5,1) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (7,2) {$6$};
    \path[draw,thick,->] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (2) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (5) -- (6);

    \path[draw=green,thick,->,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw=green,thick,->,line width=2pt] (2) -- (4);
    \path[draw=green,thick,->,line width=2pt] (4) -- (3);
    \path[draw=green,thick,->,line width=2pt] (3) -- (6);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    We can reduce also this problem to the maximum flow problem.
    Since each node can appear in at most one path,
    we have to limit the flow that goes through the nodes.
    A standard method for this is to divide each node into
    two nodes such that the first node has the incoming edges
    of the original node, the second node has the outgoing
    edges of the original node, and
    there is a new edge from the first node
    to the second node.

    In our example, the graph becomes as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (1,2) {$1$};

    \node[draw, circle] (2a) at (3,3) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3a) at (6,3) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4a) at (3,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5a) at (6,1) {$5$};

    \node[draw, circle] (2b) at (4,3) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3b) at (7,3) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4b) at (4,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5b) at (7,1) {$5$};

    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (9,2) {$6$};

    \path[draw,thick,->] (2a) -- (2b);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3a) -- (3b);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4a) -- (4b);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (5a) -- (5b);

    \path[draw,thick,->] (1) -- (2a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (1) -- (4a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (2b) -- (4a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3b) edge [bend right=30] (2a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3b) -- (5a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3b) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4b) -- (3a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4b) -- (5a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (5b) -- (6);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The maximum flow for the graph is as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (1,2) {$1$};

    \node[draw, circle] (2a) at (3,3) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3a) at (6,3) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4a) at (3,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5a) at (6,1) {$5$};

    \node[draw, circle] (2b) at (4,3) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3b) at (7,3) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4b) at (4,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5b) at (7,1) {$5$};

    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (9,2) {$6$};

    \path[draw,thick,->] (2a) -- (2b);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3a) -- (3b);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4a) -- (4b);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (5a) -- (5b);

    \path[draw,thick,->] (1) -- (2a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (1) -- (4a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (2b) -- (4a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3b) edge [bend right=30] (2a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3b) -- (5a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (3b) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4b) -- (3a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (4b) -- (5a);
    \path[draw,thick,->] (5b) -- (6);

    \path[draw=red,thick,->,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2a);
    \path[draw=red,thick,->,line width=2pt] (2a) -- (2b);
    \path[draw=red,thick,->,line width=2pt] (2b) -- (4a);
    \path[draw=red,thick,->,line width=2pt] (4a) -- (4b);
    \path[draw=red,thick,->,line width=2pt] (4b) -- (3a);
    \path[draw=red,thick,->,line width=2pt] (3a) -- (3b);
    \path[draw=red,thick,->,line width=2pt] (3b) -- (6);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Thus, the maximum number of node-disjoint paths
    from the source to the sink is 1.

    Chapter: Game theory
    Section: Game states
    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{Game theory}

    In this chapter, we will focus on two-player
    games that do not contain random elements.
    Our goal is to find a strategy that we can
    follow to win the game
    no matter what the opponent does,
    if such a strategy exists.

    It turns out that there is a general strategy
    for such games,
    and we can analyze the games using the \key{nim theory}.
    First, we will analyze simple games where
    players remove sticks from heaps,
    and after this, we will generalize the strategy
    used in those games to other games.

    \section{Game states}

    Let us consider a game where there is initially
    a heap of $n$ sticks.
    Players $A$ and $B$ move alternately,
    and player $A$ begins.
    On each move, the player has to remove
    1, 2 or 3 sticks from the heap,
    and the player who removes the last stick wins the game.

    For example, if $n=10$, the game may proceed as follows:
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Player $A$ removes 2 sticks (8 sticks left).
    \item Player $B$ removes 3 sticks (5 sticks left).
    \item Player $A$ removes 1 stick (4 sticks left).
    \item Player $B$ removes 2 sticks (2 sticks left).
    \item Player $A$ removes 2 sticks and wins.
    \end{itemize}

    This game consists of states $0,1,2,\ldots,n$,
    where the number of the state corresponds to
    the number of sticks left.

    \subsubsection{Winning and losing states}

    \index{winning state}
    \index{losing state}

    A \key{winning state} is a state where
    the player will win the game if they
    play optimally,
    and a \key{losing state} is a state
    where the player will lose the game if the
    opponent plays optimally.
    It turns out that we can classify all states
    of a game so that each state is either
    a winning state or a losing state.

    In the above game, state 0 is clearly a
    losing state, because the player cannot make
    any moves.
    States 1, 2 and 3 are winning states,
    because we can remove 1, 2 or 3 sticks
    and win the game.
    State 4, in turn, is a losing state,
    because any move leads to a state that
    is a winning state for the opponent.

    More generally, if there is a move that leads
    from the current state to a losing state,
    the current state is a winning state,
    and otherwise the current state is a losing state.
    Using this observation, we can classify all states
    of a game starting with losing states where
    there are no possible moves.

    The states $0 \ldots 15$ of the above game
    can be classified as follows
    ($W$ denotes a winning state and $L$ denotes a losing state):
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (16,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$L$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$W$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$W$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$W$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$L$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$W$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$W$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$W$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$L$};
    \node at (9.5,0.5) {$W$};
    \node at (10.5,0.5) {$W$};
    \node at (11.5,0.5) {$W$};
    \node at (12.5,0.5) {$L$};
    \node at (13.5,0.5) {$W$};
    \node at (14.5,0.5) {$W$};
    \node at (15.5,0.5) {$W$};

    \footnotesize
    \node at (0.5,1.4) {$0$};
    \node at (1.5,1.4) {$1$};
    \node at (2.5,1.4) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,1.4) {$3$};
    \node at (4.5,1.4) {$4$};
    \node at (5.5,1.4) {$5$};
    \node at (6.5,1.4) {$6$};
    \node at (7.5,1.4) {$7$};
    \node at (8.5,1.4) {$8$};
    \node at (9.5,1.4) {$9$};
    \node at (10.5,1.4) {$10$};
    \node at (11.5,1.4) {$11$};
    \node at (12.5,1.4) {$12$};
    \node at (13.5,1.4) {$13$};
    \node at (14.5,1.4) {$14$};
    \node at (15.5,1.4) {$15$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    It is easy to analyze this game:
    a state $k$ is a losing state if $k$ is
    divisible by 4, and otherwise it
    is a winning state.
    An optimal way to play the game is
    to always choose a move after which
    the number of sticks in the heap
    is divisible by 4.
    Finally, there are no sticks left and
    the opponent has lost.

    Of course, this strategy requires that
    the number of sticks is \emph{not} divisible by 4
    when it is our move.
    If it is, there is nothing we can do,
    and the opponent will win the game if
    they play optimally.

    \subsubsection{State graph}

    Let us now consider another stick game,
    where in each state $k$, it is allowed to remove
    any number $x$ of sticks such that $x$
    is smaller than $k$ and divides $k$.
    For example, in state 8 we may remove
    1, 2 or 4 sticks, but in state 7 the only
    allowed move is to remove 1 stick.

    The following picture shows the states
    $1 \ldots 9$ of the game as a \key{state graph},
    whose nodes are the states and edges are the moves between them:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,0) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,0) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (3.5,-1) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (1.5,-2) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (3,-2.75) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (2.5,-4.5) {$6$};
    \node[draw, circle] (7) at (0.5,-3.25) {$7$};

    Title: Flows with demands
    Part: 1/1
    # Flows with demands

    In a normal flow network the flow of an edge is only limited by the capacity $c(e)$ from above and by 0 from below.
    In this article we will discuss flow networks, where we additionally require the flow of each edge to have a certain amount, i.e. we bound the flow from below by a **demand** function $d(e)$:

    $$ d(e) \le f(e) \le c(e)$$

    So next each edge has a minimal flow value, that we have to pass along the edge.

    This is a generalization of the normal flow problem, since setting $d(e) = 0$ for all edges $e$ gives a normal flow network.
    Notice, that in the normal flow network it is extremely trivial to find a valid flow, just setting $f(e) = 0$ is already a valid one.
    However if the flow of each edge has to satisfy a demand, than suddenly finding a valid flow is already pretty complicated.

    We will consider two problems:

    1. finding an arbitrary flow that satisfies all constraints
    2. finding a minimal flow that satisfies all constraints

    ## Finding an arbitrary flow

    We make the following changes in the network.
    We add a new source $s'$ and a new sink $t'$, a new edge from the source $s'$ to every other vertex, a new edge for every vertex to the sink $t'$, and one edge from $t$ to $s$.
    Additionally we define the new capacity function $c'$ as:

    - $c'((s', v)) = \sum_{u \in V} d((u, v))$ for each edge $(s', v)$.
    - $c'((v, t')) = \sum_{w \in V} d((v, w))$ for each edge $(v, t')$.
    - $c'((u, v)) = c((u, v)) - d((u, v))$ for each edge $(u, v)$ in the old network.
    - $c'((t, s)) = \infty$

    If the new network has a saturating flow (a flow where each edge outgoing from $s'$ is completely filled, which is equivalent to every edge incoming to $t'$ is completely filled), then the network with demands has a valid flow, and the actual flow can be easily reconstructed from the new network.
    Otherwise there doesn't exist a flow that satisfies all conditions.
    Since a saturating flow has to be a maximum flow, it can be found by any maximum flow algorithm, like the [Edmonds-Karp algorithm](edmonds_karp.md) or the [Push-relabel algorithm](push-relabel.md).

    The correctness of these transformations is more difficult to understand.
    We can think of it in the following way:
    Each edge $e = (u, v)$ with $d(e) > 0$ is originally replaced by two edges: one with the capacity $d(i)$ , and the other with $c(i) - d(i)$.
    We want to find a flow that saturates the first edge (i.e. the flow along this edge must be equal to its capacity).
    The second edge is less important - the flow along it can be anything, assuming that it doesn't exceed its capacity.
    Consider each edge that has to be saturated, and we perform the following operation:
    we draw the edge from the new source $s'$ to its end $v$, draw the edge from its start $u$ to the new sink $t'$, remove the edge itself, and from the old sink $t$ to the old source $s$ we draw an edge of infinite capacity.
    By these actions we simulate the fact that this edge is saturated - from $v$ there will be an additionally $d(e)$ flow outgoing (we simulate it with a new source that feeds the right amount of flow to $v$), and $u$ will also push $d(e)$ additional flow (but instead along the old edge, this flow will go directly to the new sink $t'$).
    A flow with the value $d(e)$, that originally flowed along the path $s - \dots - u - v - \dots t$ can now take the new path $s' - v - \dots - t - s - \dots - u - t'$.
    The only thing that got simplified in the definition of the new network, is that if procedure created multiple edges between the same pair of vertices, then they are combined to one single edge with the summed capacity.

    ## Minimal flow

    Note that along the edge $(t, s)$ (from the old sink to the old source) with the capacity $\infty$ flows the entire flow of the corresponding old network.
    I.e. the capacity of this edge effects the flow value of the old network.
    By giving this edge a sufficient large capacity (i.e. $\infty$), the flow of the old network is unlimited.
    By limiting this edge by smaller capacities, the flow value will decrease.
    However if we limit this edge by a too small value, than the network will not have a saturated solution, e.g. the corresponding solution for the original network will not satisfy the demand of the edges.
    Obviously here can use a binary search to find the lowest value with which all constraints are still satisfied.
    This gives the minimal flow of the original network.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/465 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a dictionary as input and removes any key-value pairs where the value is considered "empty." In this context, an empty value includes `None`, but other empty values like empty strings or empty lists are not specified, so we will focus on `None`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we will iterate through the dictionary and check each value. If a value is `None`, we will skip that key-value pair. We will create a new dictionary that only includes the key-value pairs where the value is not `None`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function drop_empty(input_dict):
       create an empty dictionary called result
       for each key, value in input_dict:
           if value is not None:
               add key and value to result
       return result
   ```
