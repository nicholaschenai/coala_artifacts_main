INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that finds the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number. The third Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number should be 7.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers. To find the nth prime in this sequence, we need to generate prime numbers and check if they belong to the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams sequence. The sequence can be generated using a specific formula or method, and we will keep track of how many such primes we have found until we reach the nth one.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function newman_prime(n):
       initialize a list to hold newman primes
       initialize a counter for found newman primes
       initialize a number to check for primality
       
       while counter is less than n:
           check if the number is prime
           if it is prime:
               check if it is a newman prime using the newman prime conditions
               if it is a newman prime:
                   add it to the list of newman primes
                   increment the counter
           increment the number to check the next one
       
       return the nth newman prime from the list
   ```

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. 

    \subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

    Part: 1/2
    # Primality tests

    This article describes multiple algorithms to determine if a number is prime or not.

    ## Trial division

    By definition a prime number doesn't have any divisors other than $1$ and itself.
    A composite number has at least one additional divisor, let's call it $d$.
    Naturally $\frac{n}{d}$ is also a divisor of $n$.
    It's easy to see, that either $d \le \sqrt{n}$ or $\frac{n}{d} \le \sqrt{n}$, therefore one of the divisors $d$ and $\frac{n}{d}$ is $\le \sqrt{n}$.
    We can use this information to check for primality.

    We try to find a non-trivial divisor, by checking if any of the numbers between $2$ and $\sqrt{n}$ is a divisor of $n$.
    If it is a divisor, than $n$ is definitely not prime, otherwise it is.

    ```cpp
    bool isPrime(int x) {
        for (int d = 2; d * d <= x; d++) {
            if (x % d == 0)
                return false;
        }
        return x >= 2;
    }
    ```

    This is the simplest form of a prime check.
    You can optimize this function quite a bit, for instance by only checking all odd numbers in the loop, since the only even prime number is 2.
    Multiple such optimizations are described in the article about [integer factorization](factorization.md).

    ## Fermat primality test

    This is a probabilistic test.

    Fermat's little theorem (see also [Euler's totient function](phi-function.md)) states, that for a prime number $p$ and a coprime integer $a$ the following equation holds:

    $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p$$

    In general this theorem doesn't hold for composite numbers.

    This can be used to create a primality test.
    We pick an integer $2 \le a \le p - 2$, and check if the equation holds or not.
    If it doesn't hold, e.g. $a^{p-1} \not\equiv 1 \bmod p$, we know that $p$ cannot be a prime number.
    In this case we call the base $a$ a *Fermat witness* for the compositeness of $p$.

    However it is also possible, that the equation holds for a composite number.
    So if the equation holds, we don't have a proof for primality.
    We only can say that $p$ is *probably prime*.
    If it turns out that the number is actually composite, we call the base $a$ a *Fermat liar*.

    By running the test for all possible bases $a$, we can actually prove that a number is prime.
    However this is not done in practice, since this is a lot more effort that just doing *trial division*.
    Instead the test will be repeated multiple times with random choices for $a$.
    If we find no witness for the compositeness, it is very likely that the number is in fact prime.

    ```cpp
    bool probablyPrimeFermat(int n, int iter=5) {
        if (n < 4)
            return n == 2 || n == 3;

        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {
            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);
            if (binpower(a, n - 1, n) != 1)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    ```

    We use [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md) to efficiently compute the power $a^{p-1}$.

    There is one bad news though:
    there exist some composite numbers where $a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \bmod n$ holds for all $a$ coprime to $n$, for instance for the number $561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17$.
    Such numbers are called *Carmichael numbers*.
    The Fermat primality test can identify these numbers only, if we have immense luck and choose a base $a$ with $\gcd(a, n) \ne 1$.

    The Fermat test is still be used in practice, as it is very fast and Carmichael numbers are very rare.
    E.g. there only exist 646 such numbers below $10^9$.

    ## Miller-Rabin primality test

    The Miller-Rabin test extends the ideas from the Fermat test.

    For an odd number $n$, $n-1$ is even and we can factor out all powers of 2.
    We can write:

    $$n - 1 = 2^s \cdot d,~\text{with}~d~\text{odd}.$$

    This allows us to factorize the equation of Fermat's little theorem:

    $$\begin{array}{rl}
    a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \bmod n &\Longleftrightarrow a^{2^s d} - 1 \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-1} d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\quad\vdots \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) \cdots (a^{d} + 1) (a^{d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    \end{array}$$

    If $n$ is prime, then $n$ has to divide one of these factors.
    And in the Miller-Rabin primality test we check exactly that statement, which is a more stricter version of the statement of the Fermat test.
    For a base $2 \le a \le n-2$ we check if either

    $$a^d \equiv 1 \bmod n$$

    holds or

    $$a^{2^r d} \equiv -1 \bmod n$$

    holds for some $0 \le r \le s - 1$.

    If we found a base $a$ which doesn't satisfy any of the above equalities, than we found a *witness* for the compositeness of $n$.
    In this case we have proven that $n$ is not a prime number.

    Similar to the Fermat test, it is also possible that the set of equations is satisfied for a composite number.
    In that case the base $a$ is called a *strong liar*.
    If a base $a$ satisfies the equations (one of them), $n$ is only *strong probable prime*.
    However, there are no numbers like the Carmichael numbers, where all non-trivial bases lie.
    In fact it is possible to show, that at most $\frac{1}{4}$ of the bases can be strong liars.
    If $n$ is composite, we have a probability of $\ge 75\%$ that a random base will tell us that it is composite.
    By doing multiple iterations, choosing different random bases, we can tell with very high probability if the number is truly prime or if it is composite.

    Here is an implementation for 64 bit integer.

    ```cpp
    using u64 = uint64_t;
    using u128 = __uint128_t;

    u64 binpower(u64 base, u64 e, u64 mod) {
        u64 result = 1;
        base %= mod;
        while (e) {
            if (e & 1)
                result = (u128)result * base % mod;
            base = (u128)base * base % mod;
            e >>= 1;
        }
        return result;
    }

    bool check_composite(u64 n, u64 a, u64 d, int s) {
        u64 x = binpower(a, d, n);
        if (x == 1 || x == n - 1)
            return false;
        for (int r = 1; r < s; r++) {
            x = (u128)x * x % n;
            if (x == n - 1)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    };

    bool MillerRabin(u64 n, int iter=5) { // returns true if n is probably prime, else returns false.
        if (n < 4)
            return n == 2 || n == 3;

        int s = 0;
        u64 d = n - 1;
        while ((d & 1) == 0) {
            d >>= 1;
            s++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {
            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);
            if (check_composite(n, a, d, s))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    ```

    Before the Miller-Rabin test you can test additionally if one of the first few prime numbers is a divisor.
    This can speed up the test by a lot, since most composite numbers have very small prime divisors.
    E.g. $88\%$ of all numbers have a prime factors smaller than $100$.

    ### Deterministic version

    Miller showed that it is possible to make the algorithm deterministic by only checking all bases $\le O((\ln n)^2)$.
    Bach later gave a concrete bound, it is only necessary to test all bases $a \le 2 \ln(n)^2$.

    This is still a pretty large number of bases.
    So people have invested quite a lot of computation power into finding lower bounds.
    It turns out, for testing a 32 bit integer it is only necessary to check the first 4 prime bases: 2, 3, 5 and 7.
    The smallest composite number that fails this test is $3,215,031,751 = 151 \cdot 751 \cdot 28351$.
    And for testing 64 bit integer it is enough to check the first 12 prime bases: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.

    This results in the following deterministic implementation:

    ```cpp
    bool MillerRabin(u64 n) { // returns true if n is prime, else returns false.
        if (n < 2)
            return false;

        int r = 0;
        u64 d = n - 1;
        while ((d & 1) == 0) {
            d >>= 1;

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [prompt] 
The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [generation text] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams Primes**: 
   - The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes are a specific sequence of primes that can be generated using a recurrence relation. The first few primes in this sequence are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.
   - The sequence is not simply the prime numbers; it has a specific pattern that needs to be followed.

2. **Issues in the Previous Code**:
   - The logic for generating the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes was not correctly implemented. The code attempted to check if a prime number was part of the sequence by comparing it to previously found primes, but it did not correctly generate the sequence based on the defined recurrence relation.
   - The condition to check if a number is a Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime was flawed. It did not utilize the correct method to generate the sequence based on the known primes.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I incorrectly assumed that simply checking if a number was prime and then checking if it was in a list of previously found primes would suffice. This does not account for the specific generation of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.
   - The algorithm was inefficient and could lead to timeouts, especially for larger values of `n`, because it was not leveraging the properties of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes effectively.

### Revised Plan
1. **Generate the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes directly** using the known sequence.
2. **Store the primes** in a list and return the nth prime directly from this list.

### Pseudocode for the Revised Solution
```
function newman_prime(n):
    # Initialize the list of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes
    primes = [2, 3]
    # Start generating primes until we have n of them
    while length of primes < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_prime = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        # Check if the next_prime is prime
        if is_prime(next_prime):
            primes.append(next_prime)
    return primes[n-1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

Now, I will implement this revised plan in Python code. 

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def newman_prime(n):
    # Find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number
    primes = [2, 3]  # Starting primes
    while len(primes) < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_prime = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        if is_prime(next_prime):
            primes.append(next_prime)
    return primes[n - 1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [prompt] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams Primes**: 
   - The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes are a specific sequence of primes that can be generated using a recurrence relation. The first few primes in this sequence are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.
   - The sequence is not simply the prime numbers; it has a specific pattern that needs to be followed.

2. **Issues in the Previous Code**:
   - The logic for generating the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes was not correctly implemented. The code attempted to check if a prime number was part of the sequence by comparing it to previously found primes, but it did not correctly generate the sequence based on the defined recurrence relation.
   - The condition to check if a number is a Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime was flawed. It did not utilize the correct method to generate the sequence based on the known primes.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I incorrectly assumed that simply checking if a number was prime and then checking if it was in a list of previously found primes would suffice. This does not account for the specific generation of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.
   - The algorithm was inefficient and could lead to timeouts, especially for larger values of `n`, because it was not leveraging the properties of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes effectively.

### Revised Plan
1. **Generate the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes directly** using the known sequence.
2. **Store the primes** in a list and return the nth prime directly from this list.

### Pseudocode for the Revised Solution
```
function newman_prime(n):
    # Initialize the list of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes
    primes = [2, 3]
    # Start generating primes until we have n of them
    while length of primes < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_prime = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        # Check if the next_prime is prime
        if is_prime(next_prime):
            primes.append(next_prime)
    return primes[n-1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

Now, I will implement this revised plan in Python code. 

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def newman_prime(n):
    # Find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number
    primes = [2, 3]  # Starting primes
    while len(primes) < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_prime = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        if is_prime(next_prime):
            primes.append(next_prime)
    return primes[n - 1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$.

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

    Title: Sieve of Eratosthenes
    Part: 1/2
    # Sieve of Eratosthenes

    Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm for finding all the prime numbers in a segment $[1;n]$ using $O(n \log \log n)$ operations.

    The algorithm is very simple:
    at the beginning we write down all numbers between 2 and $n$.
    We mark all proper multiples of 2 (since 2 is the smallest prime number) as composite.
    A proper multiple of a number $x$, is a number greater than $x$ and divisible by $x$.
    Then we find the next number that hasn't been marked as composite, in this case it is 3.
    Which means 3 is prime, and we mark all proper multiples of 3 as composite.
    The next unmarked number is 5, which is the next prime number, and we mark all proper multiples of it.
    And we continue this procedure until we processed all numbers in the row.

    In the following image you can see a visualization of the algorithm for computing all prime numbers in the range $[1; 16]$. It can be seen, that quite often we mark numbers as composite multiple times.

    <center>![Sieve of Eratosthenes](sieve_eratosthenes.png)</center>

    The idea behind is this:
    A number is prime, if none of the smaller prime numbers divides it.
    Since we iterate over the prime numbers in order, we already marked all numbers, who are divisible by at least one of the prime numbers, as divisible.
    Hence if we reach a cell and it is not marked, then it isn't divisible by any smaller prime number and therefore has to be prime.

    ## Implementation

    ```cpp
    int n;
    vector<bool> is_prime(n+1, true);
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        if (is_prime[i] && (long long)i * i <= n) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
                is_prime[j] = false;
        }
    }
    ```

    This code first marks all numbers except zero and one as potential prime numbers, then it begins the process of sifting composite numbers.
    For this it iterates over all numbers from $2$ to $n$.
    If the current number $i$ is a prime number, it marks all numbers that are multiples of $i$ as composite numbers, starting from $i^2$.
    This is already an optimization over naive way of implementing it, and is allowed as all smaller numbers that are multiples of $i$ necessary also have a prime factor which is less than $i$, so all of them were already sifted earlier.
    Since $i^2$ can easily overflow the type `int`, the additional verification is done using type `long long` before the second nested loop.

    Using such implementation the algorithm consumes $O(n)$ of the memory (obviously) and performs $O(n \log \log n)$ (see next section).

    ## Asymptotic analysis

    It's simple to prove a running time of $O(n \log n)$ without knowing anything about the distribution of primes - ignoring the `is_prime` check, the inner loop runs (at most) $n/i$ times for $i = 2, 3, 4, \dots$, leading the total number of operations in the inner loop to be a harmonic sum like $n(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + \cdots)$, which is bounded by $O(n \log n)$.

    Let's prove that algorithm's running time is $O(n \log \log n)$.
    The algorithm will perform $\frac{n}{p}$ operations for every prime $p \le n$ the inner loop.
    Hence, we need to evaluate the next expression:

    $$\sum_{\substack{p \le n, \\\ p \text{ prime}}} \frac n p = n \cdot \sum_{\substack{p \le n, \\\ p \text{ prime}}} \frac 1 p.$$

    Let's recall two known facts.

      - The number of prime numbers less than or equal to $n$ is approximately $\frac n {\ln n}$.
      - The $k$-th prime number approximately equals $k \ln k$ (that follows immediately from the previous fact).

    Thus we can write down the sum in the following way:

    $$\sum_{\substack{p \le n, \\\ p \text{ prime}}} \frac 1 p \approx \frac 1 2 + \sum_{k = 2}^{\frac n {\ln n}} \frac 1 {k \ln k}.$$

    Here we extracted the first prime number 2 from the sum, because $k = 1$ in approximation $k \ln k$  is $0$ and causes a division by zero.

    Now, let's evaluate this sum using the integral of a same function over $k$ from $2$ to $\frac n {\ln n}$ (we can make such approximation because, in fact, the sum is related to the integral as its approximation using the rectangle method):

    $$\sum_{k = 2}^{\frac n {\ln n}} \frac 1 {k \ln k} \approx \int_2^{\frac n {\ln n}} \frac 1 {k \ln k} dk.$$

    The antiderivative for the integrand is  $\ln \ln k$. Using a substitution and removing terms of lower order, we'll get the result:

    $$\int_2^{\frac n {\ln n}} \frac 1 {k \ln k} dk = \ln \ln \frac n {\ln n} - \ln \ln 2 = \ln(\ln n - \ln \ln n) - \ln \ln 2 \approx \ln \ln n.$$

    Now, returning to the original sum, we'll get its approximate evaluation:

    $$\sum_{\substack{p \le n, \\\ p\ is\ prime}} \frac n p \approx n \ln \ln n + o(n).$$

    You can find a more strict proof (that gives more precise evaluation which is accurate within constant multipliers) in the book authored by Hardy & Wright "An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers" (p. 349).

    ## Different optimizations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes

    The biggest weakness of the algorithm is, that it "walks" along the memory multiple times, only manipulating single elements.
    This is not very cache friendly.
    And because of that, the constant which is concealed in $O(n \log \log n)$ is comparably big.

    Besides, the consumed memory is a bottleneck for big $n$.

    The methods presented below allow us to reduce the quantity of the performed operations, as well as to shorten the consumed memory noticeably.

    ### Sieving till root

    Obviously, to find all the prime numbers until $n$, it will be enough just to perform the sifting only by the prime numbers, which do not exceed the root of $n$.

    ```cpp
    int n;
    vector<bool> is_prime(n+1, true);
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (is_prime[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
                is_prime[j] = false;
        }
    }

The approach will involve directly generating the sequence based on the known properties of these primes.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):

   - Each candidate is checked for primality, and if it is prime, it is added to the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes are a specific sequence of prime numbers. 
   - To find the nth prime, we need to generate prime numbers and check if they belong to the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams sequence.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [prompt] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams Primes**: 
   - The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes are a specific sequence of primes that can be generated using a recurrence relation. The first few primes in this sequence are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.
   - The sequence is not simply the prime numbers; it has a specific pattern that needs to be followed.

2. **Issues in the Previous Code**:
   - The logic for generating the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes was not correctly implemented. The code attempted to check if a prime number was part of the sequence by comparing it to previously found primes, but it did not correctly generate the sequence based on the defined recurrence relation.
   - The condition to check if a number is a Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime was flawed. It did not utilize the correct method to generate the sequence based on the known primes.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I incorrectly assumed that simply checking if a number was prime and then checking if it was in a list of previously found primes would suffice. This does not account for the specific generation of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.
   - The algorithm was inefficient and could lead to timeouts, especially for larger values of `n`, because it was not leveraging the properties of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes effectively.

### Revised Plan
1. **Generate the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes directly** using the known sequence.
2. **Store the primes** in a list and return the nth prime directly from this list.

### Pseudocode for the Revised Solution
```
function newman_prime(n):
    # Initialize the list of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes
    primes = [2, 3]
    # Start generating primes until we have n of them
    while length of primes < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_prime = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        # Check if the next_prime is prime
        if is_prime(next_prime):
            primes.append(next_prime)
    return primes[n-1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

Now, I will implement this revised plan in Python code. 

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def newman_prime(n):
    # Find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number
    primes = [2, 3]  # Starting primes
    while len(primes) < n:

        next_prime = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        if is_prime(next_prime):
            primes.append(next_prime)

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis and the provided reference material, I will revise the implementation to correctly generate the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes. The approach will involve directly generating the sequence based on the known properties of these primes.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def newman_prime(n):
    # Find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number
    primes = [2, 3]  # Starting primes
    while len(primes) < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_candidate = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        if is_prime(next_candidate):
            primes.append(next_candidate)
    return primes[n - 1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **is_prime Function**: This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
2. **newman_prime Function**:
   - It initializes a list of known Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes starting with 2 and 3.
   - It continues to generate the next candidate prime using the recurrence relation until the list contains `n` primes.
   - Each candidate is checked for primality, and if it is prime, it is added to the list.
   - Finally, it returns the nth prime from the list.

This implementation should efficiently find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number without timing out.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [generation text] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams Primes**:
   - The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes are defined by a specific sequence, and the first few primes in this sequence are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.
   - The sequence is generated using a specific recurrence relation, but it seems I did not correctly implement the logic to generate the sequence based on the known primes.

2. **Issues in the Previous Code**:
   - The code attempts to generate the next candidate prime using the formula `next_candidate = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1`, but this does not correctly follow the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime generation rules.
   - The logic for generating the next prime was flawed, as it did not account for the correct sequence of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I incorrectly assumed that the recurrence relation I used would yield the correct sequence of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes. The relation I used was not appropriate for generating the sequence.
   - The approach to check for primality was correct, but the generation of the primes was not aligned with the definition of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.

### Revised Plan
1. **Use the correct sequence generation**: The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes can be generated from the known sequence of primes.
2. **Directly generate the sequence**: Start with the known primes and generate the next primes based on the properties of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.

### Pseudocode for the Revised Solution
```
function newman_prime(n):
    # Initialize the list of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]  # Known primes
    # If n is less than or equal to the length of known primes, return the nth prime
    if n <= length of primes:
        return primes[n-1]
    # Continue generating primes until we have n of them
    while length of primes < n:
        # Generate the next prime using the correct logic
        next_prime = find_next_prime()  # Implement a function to find the next prime
        primes.append(next_prime)
    return primes[n-1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

Now, I will implement this revised plan in Python code. 

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def newman_prime(n):
    # List of known Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]  # First few primes
    # If n is within the known primes, return it directly
    if n <= len(primes):
        return primes[n - 1]
    
    # Start generating primes beyond the known list
    current_number = primes[-1] + 1  # Start checking from the next number
    while len(primes) < n:
        if is_prime(current_number):
            # Check if the prime is a Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime
            if current_number in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]:  # Check against known primes
                primes.append(current_number)
        current_number += 1  # Move to the next number
    return primes[n - 1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_candidate = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        if is_prime(next_candidate):
            primes.append(next_candidate)
    return primes[n - 1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **is_prime Function**: This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
2. **newman_prime Function**:
   - It initializes a list of known Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes starting with 2 and 3.
   - It continues to generate the next candidate prime using the recurrence relation until the list contains `n` primes.
   - Each candidate is checked for primality, and if it is prime, it is added to the list.
   - Finally, it returns the nth prime from the list.

This implementation should efficiently find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number without timing out.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [prompt] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams Primes**:
   - The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes are defined by a specific sequence, and the first few primes in this sequence are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.
   - The sequence is generated using a specific recurrence relation, but it seems I did not correctly implement the logic to generate the sequence based on the known primes.

2. **Issues in the Previous Code**:
   - The code attempts to generate the next candidate prime using the formula `next_candidate = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1`, but this does not correctly follow the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime generation rules.
   - The logic for generating the next prime was flawed, as it did not account for the correct sequence of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I incorrectly assumed that the recurrence relation I used would yield the correct sequence of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes. The relation I used was not appropriate for generating the sequence.
   - The approach to check for primality was correct, but the generation of the primes was not aligned with the definition of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.

### Revised Plan
1. **Use the correct sequence generation**: The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes can be generated from the known sequence of primes.
2. **Directly generate the sequence**: Start with the known primes and generate the next primes based on the properties of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.

### Pseudocode for the Revised Solution
```
function newman_prime(n):
    # Initialize the list of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]  # Known primes
    # If n is less than or equal to the length of known primes, return the nth prime
    if n <= length of primes:
        return primes[n-1]
    # Continue generating primes until we have n of them
    while length of primes < n:
        # Generate the next prime using the correct logic
        next_prime = find_next_prime()  # Implement a function to find the next prime
        primes.append(next_prime)
    return primes[n-1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

Now, I will implement this revised plan in Python code. 

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def newman_prime(n):
    # List of known Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]  # First few primes
    # If n is within the known primes, return it directly
    if n <= len(primes):
        return primes[n - 1]
    
    # Start generating primes beyond the known list
    current_number = primes[-1] + 1  # Start checking from the next number
    while len(primes) < n:
        if is_prime(current_number):
            # Check if the prime is a Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime
            if current_number in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]:  # Check against known primes
                primes.append(current_number)
        current_number += 1  # Move to the next number
    return primes[n - 1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
``` 

This implementation should now correctly find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number.

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. 

    \subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \subsubsection{Euler's totient function}

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [generation text] Given the insights from the previous analysis and the reference material, I will revise the implementation to correctly generate the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes. The key is to ensure that we are generating the primes based on the correct sequence and efficiently checking for primality.

### Revised Plan
1. **Use the correct sequence generation**: The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes can be generated from the known sequence of primes.
2. **Directly generate the sequence**: Start with the known primes and generate the next primes based on the properties of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.

### Implementation
The first few Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes are known, and we can generate them using a specific recurrence relation. The sequence starts with 2, 3, and then follows the pattern defined by the recurrence relation.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):

            primes.append(next_candidate)
    return primes[n - 1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **is_prime Function**: This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.

   - It initializes a list of known Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes starting with 2 and 3.

The code attempted to check if a prime number was part of the sequence by comparing it to previously found primes, but it did not correctly generate the sequence based on the defined recurrence relation.
   - The condition to check if a number is a Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime was flawed. It did not utilize the correct method to generate the sequence based on the known primes.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I incorrectly assumed that simply checking if a number was prime and then checking if it was in a list of previously found primes would suffice. This does not account for the specific generation of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.
   - The algorithm was inefficient and could lead to timeouts, especially for larger values of `n`, because it was not leveraging the properties of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes effectively.

### Revised Plan
1. **Generate the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes directly** using the known sequence.
2. **Store the primes** in a list and return the nth prime directly from this list.

### Pseudocode for the Revised Solution
```
function newman_prime(n):
    # Initialize the list of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes
    primes = [2, 3]
    # Start generating primes until we have n of them
    while length of primes < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_prime = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        # Check if the next_prime is prime
        if is_prime(next_prime):
            primes.append(next_prime)
    return primes[n-1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

Now, I will implement this revised plan in Python code. 

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def newman_prime(n):
    # Find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number
    primes = [2, 3]  # Starting primes
    while len(primes) < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_prime = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        if is_prime(next_prime):
            primes.append(next_prime)
    return primes[n - 1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis and the provided reference material, I will revise the implementation to correctly generate the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes. The approach will involve directly generating the sequence based on the known properties of these primes.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):

    while len(primes) < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_candidate = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        if is_prime(next_candidate):
            primes.append(next_candidate)
    return primes[n - 1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **is_prime Function**: This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
2. **newman_prime Function**:
   - It initializes a list of known Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes starting with 2 and 3.
   - It continues to generate the next candidate prime using the recurrence relation until the list contains `n` primes.
   - Each candidate is checked for primality, and if it is prime, it is added to the list.
   - Finally, it returns the nth prime from the list.

This implementation should efficiently find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number without timing out.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [prompt] Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:

1. **Understanding the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams Primes**: 
   - The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes are a specific sequence of primes that can be generated using a recurrence relation. The first few primes in this sequence are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.
   - The sequence is not simply the prime numbers; it has a specific pattern that needs to be followed.

2. **Issues in the Previous Code**:
   - The logic for generating the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes was not correctly implemented. The code attempted to check if a prime number was part of the sequence by comparing it to previously found primes, but it did not correctly generate the sequence based on the defined recurrence relation.
   - The condition to check if a number is a Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime was flawed. It did not utilize the correct method to generate the sequence based on the known primes.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**:
   - I incorrectly assumed that simply checking if a number was prime and then checking if it was in a list of previously found primes would suffice. This does not account for the specific generation of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.
   - The algorithm was inefficient and could lead to timeouts, especially for larger values of `n`, because it was not leveraging the properties of the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes effectively.

### Revised Plan
1. **Generate the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes directly** using the known sequence.
2. **Store the primes** in a list and return the nth prime directly from this list.

### Pseudocode for the Revised Solution
```
function newman_prime(n):
    # Initialize the list of Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes
    primes = [2, 3]
    # Start generating primes until we have n of them
    while length of primes < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_prime = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        # Check if the next_prime is prime
        if is_prime(next_prime):
            primes.append(next_prime)
    return primes[n-1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

Now, I will implement this revised plan in Python code. 

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def newman_prime(n):
    # Find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number
    primes = [2, 3]  # Starting primes
    while len(primes) < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_prime = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        if is_prime(next_prime):
            primes.append(next_prime)
    return primes[n - 1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [prompt] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis and the provided reference material, I will revise the implementation to correctly generate the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes. The approach will involve directly generating the sequence based on the known properties of these primes.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    # Check if a number is prime
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def newman_prime(n):
    # Find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number
    primes = [2, 3]  # Starting primes
    while len(primes) < n:
        # Calculate the next prime using the recurrence relation
        next_candidate = 2 * primes[-1] + primes[-2] + 1
        if is_prime(next_candidate):
            primes.append(next_candidate)
    return primes[n - 1]  # Return the nth prime (1-indexed)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **is_prime Function**: This function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
2. **newman_prime Function**:
   - It initializes a list of known Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes starting with 2 and 3.
   - It continues to generate the next candidate prime using the recurrence relation until the list contains `n` primes.
   - Each candidate is checked for primality, and if it is prime, it is added to the list.
   - Finally, it returns the nth prime from the list.

This implementation should efficiently find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number without timing out.

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. 

    \subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [generation text] Given the previous analysis and the reference material, it seems that the approach to generating the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes needs to be corrected. The previous attempts did not correctly implement the logic for generating these primes based on their specific properties.

### Key Insights
1. **Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams Primes**: The sequence starts with 2, 3, and then follows a specific pattern. The next primes in the sequence can be generated based on the known properties of these primes.
2. **Efficient Prime Generation**: Instead of generating primes one by one and checking each for primality, we can use a more efficient method to generate the required primes directly.

### Correct Implementation
To implement the solution correctly, we will:
- Use a list of known Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.
- If `n` is less than or equal to the length of this list, return the corresponding prime.
- If `n` exceeds the known list, we will generate additional primes as needed.

Hereâ€™s the corrected Python code:

```python
def newman_prime(n):
    # List of known Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541, 547, 557, 563, 569, 571, 577, 587, 593, 599, 601, 607, 613, 617, 619, 631, 641, 643, 647, 653, 659, 661, 673, 677, 683, 691, 701, 709, 719, 727, 733, 739, 743, 751, 757, 761, 769, 773, 787, 797, 809, 811, 821, 823, 827, 829, 839, 853, 857, 859, 863, 877, 881, 883, 887, 907, 911, 919, 929, 937, 941, 947, 953, 967, 971, 977, 983, 991, 997]
    
    # Return the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime (1-indexed)
    return primes[n - 1]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **List of Known Primes**: The list contains the first few Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams primes.
2. **Return the nth Prime**: The function simply returns the nth prime from the list, adjusting for 1-based indexing.

This implementation should now correctly find the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime number without timing out.
