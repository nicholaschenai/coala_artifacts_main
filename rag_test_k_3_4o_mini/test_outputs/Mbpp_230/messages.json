Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm\n    Part: 3/4\n    ```\n\n    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\\pi$, and then compute the final answers:\n    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.\n    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.\n\n    Now let us consider the second problem.\n    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:\n    we create the string $s + \\# + t$ and compute its prefix function.\n    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\\pi[i]$ for $i \\ge n + 1$.\n    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.\n\n    ### The number of different substring in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.\n\n    We will solve this problem iteratively.\n    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.\n\n    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.\n    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.\n    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.\n\n    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.\n    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.\n    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ long.\n    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.\n\n    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \\pi_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.\n\n    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.\n\n    ### Compressing a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to find the shortest \"compressed\" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.\n\n    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.\n    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \\pi[n - 1]$.\n    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.\n\n    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.\n    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.\n    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.\n    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.\n    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.\n    And so on.\n    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.\n\n    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.\n    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.\n    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.\n\n    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.\n    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.\n    We prove it by contradiction.\n    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).\n    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.\n    Now consider the second block of the string.\n    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.\n    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.\n    Contradiction.\n\n    $$\\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \\overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$\n\n    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\\pi[7] = 5}$$\n\n    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \\Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$\n\n    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function\n\n    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \\# + t$.\n    Obviously, since $\\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.\n    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \\#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:\n\n    $$\\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \\dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \\#}_{\\text{need to store}} ~ \\underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \\dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\\text{do not need to store}}$$\n\n    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \\in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.\n\n    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.\n\n    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\\text{old}_\\pi, c) \\rightarrow \\text{new}_\\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                int j = i;\n                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])\n                    j = pi[j-1];\n                if ('a' + c == s[j])\n                    j++;\n                aut[i][c] = j;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.\n    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.\n    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])\n                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];\n                else\n                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Dynamic programming\n    Section: Edit distance\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Edit distance}\n\n    \\index{edit distance}\n    \\index{Levenshtein distance}\n\n    The \\key{edit distance} or \\key{Levenshtein distance}\\footnote{The distance\n    is named after V. I. Levenshtein who studied it in connection with binary codes \\cite{lev66}.}\n    is the minimum number of editing operations\n    needed to transform a string\n    into another string.\n    The allowed editing operations are as follows:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item insert a character (e.g. \\texttt{ABC} $\\rightarrow$ \\texttt{ABCA})\n    \\item remove a character (e.g. \\texttt{ABC} $\\rightarrow$ \\texttt{AC})\n    \\item modify a character (e.g. \\texttt{ABC} $\\rightarrow$ \\texttt{ADC})\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    For example, the edit distance between\n    \\texttt{LOVE} and \\texttt{MOVIE} is 2,\n    because we can first perform the operation\n     \\texttt{LOVE} $\\rightarrow$ \\texttt{MOVE}\n    (modify) and then the operation\n    \\texttt{MOVE} $\\rightarrow$ \\texttt{MOVIE}\n    (insert).\n    This is the smallest possible number of operations,\n    because it is clear that only one operation is not enough.\n\n    Suppose that we are given a string \\texttt{x}\n    of length $n$ and a string \\texttt{y} of length $m$,\n    and we want to calculate the edit distance between\n    \\texttt{x} and \\texttt{y}.\n    To solve the problem, we define a function\n    $\\texttt{distance}(a,b)$ that gives the\n    edit distance between prefixes\n    $\\texttt{x}[0 \\ldots a]$ and $\\texttt{y}[0 \\ldots b]$.\n    Thus, using this function, the edit distance\n    between \\texttt{x} and \\texttt{y} equals $\\texttt{distance}(n-1,m-1)$.\n\n    We can calculate values of \\texttt{distance}\n    as follows:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\texttt{distance}(a,b) = \\min(& \\texttt{distance}(a,b-1)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{distance}(a-1,b)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{distance}(a-1,b-1)+\\texttt{cost}(a,b)).\n    \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    Here $\\texttt{cost}(a,b)=0$ if $\\texttt{x}[a]=\\texttt{y}[b]$,\n    and otherwise $\\texttt{cost}(a,b)=1$.\n    The formula considers the following ways to\n    edit the string \\texttt{x}:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\texttt{distance}(a,b-1)$: insert a character at the end of \\texttt{x}\n    \\item $\\texttt{distance}(a-1,b)$: remove the last character from \\texttt{x}\n    \\item $\\texttt{distance}(a-1,b-1)$: match or modify the last character of \\texttt{x}\n    \\end{itemize}\n    In the two first cases, one editing operation is needed\n    (insert or remove).\n    In the last case, if $\\texttt{x}[a]=\\texttt{y}[b]$,\n    we can match the last characters without editing,\n    and otherwise one editing operation is needed (modify).\n\n    The following table shows the values of \\texttt{distance}\n    in the example case:\n    \\begin{center}\n

\\section{Shortening code}\n\n    Short code is ideal in competitive programming,\n    because programs should be written\n    as fast as possible.\n    Because of this, competitive programmers often define\n    shorter names for datatypes and other parts of code.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Type names}\n    \\index{tuppdef@\\texttt{typedef}}\n    Using the command \\texttt{typedef}\n    it is possible to give a shorter name\n    to a datatype.\n    For example, the name \\texttt{long long} is long,\n    so we can define a shorter name \\texttt{ll}:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    typedef long long ll;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this, the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    long long a = 123456789;\n    long long b = 987654321;\n    cout << a*b << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    can be shortened as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    ll a = 123456789;\n    ll b = 987654321;\n    cout << a*b << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The command \\texttt{typedef}\n    can also be used with more complex types.\n    For example, the following code gives\n    the name \\texttt{vi} for a vector of integers\n    and the name \\texttt{pi} for a pair\n    that contains two integers.\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    typedef vector<int> vi;\n    typedef pair<int,int> pi;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Macros}\n    \\index{macro}\n    Another way to shorten code is to define\n    \\key{macros}.\n    A macro means that certain strings in\n    the code will be changed before the compilation.\n    In C++, macros are defined using the\n    \\texttt{\\#define} keyword.\n\n    For example, we can define the following macros:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #define F first\n    #define S second\n    #define PB push_back\n    #define MP make_pair\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this, the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    v.push_back(make_pair(y1,x1));\n    v.push_back(make_pair(y2,x2));\n    int d = v[i].first+v[i].second;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    can be shortened as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    v.PB(MP(y1,x1));\n    v.PB(MP(y2,x2));\n    int d = v[i].F+v[i].S;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    A macro can also have parameters\n    which makes it possible to shorten loops and other\n    structures.\n    For example, we can define the following macro:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #define REP(i,a,b) for (int i = a; i <= b; i++)\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this, the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        search(i);\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    can be shortened as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    REP(i,1,n) {\n        search(i);\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Sometimes macros cause bugs that may be difficult\n    to detect. For example, consider the following macro\n    that calculates the square of a number:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #define SQ(a) a*a\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    This macro \\emph{does not} always work as expected.\n    For example, the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << SQ(3+3) << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    corresponds to the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << 3+3*3+3 << \"\\n\"; // 15\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    A better version of the macro is as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #define SQ(a) (a)*(a)\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    Now the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << SQ(3+3) << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    corresponds to the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << (3+3)*(3+3) << \"\\n\"; // 36\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The function should replace all spaces in the string with the specified character and return the modified string.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. If we encounter a space, we will replace it with the specified character. If the character is not a space, we will keep it as is. Finally, we will join all the characters together to form the modified string.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function replace_blank(input_string, replacement_char):\n       create an empty list to hold characters\n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is a space:\n               append replacement_char to the list\n           else:\n               append character to the list\n       join the list into a single string\n       return the new string\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef replace_blank(input_string: str, replacement_char: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty list to hold characters\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # If the character is a space, replace it with the replacement character\n        if char == ' ':\n            result.append(replacement_char)\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, keep the character as is\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a single string\n    return ''.join(result)\n```"
