    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a string and a character as inputs. The function should replace all spaces in the string with the specified character and return the modified string.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. If we encounter a space, we will replace it with the specified character. If the character is not a space, we will keep it as is. Finally, we will join all the characters together to form the modified string.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function replace_blank(input_string, replacement_char):\n       create an empty list to hold characters\n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is a space:\n               append replacement_char to the list\n           else:\n               append character to the list\n       join the list into a single string\n       return the new string\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef replace_blank(input_string: str, replacement_char: str) -> str:\n    # Create an empty list to hold characters\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # If the character is a space, replace it with the replacement character\n        if char == ' ':\n            result.append(replacement_char)\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, keep the character as is\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a single string\n    return ''.join(result)\n```",
