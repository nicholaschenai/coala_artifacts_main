INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/116 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of positive integers and combines them into a single integer. For example, if the input is (1, 2, 3), the output should be 123.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can convert each integer in the tuple to a string, concatenate these strings together, and then convert the resulting string back into an integer. This will give us the desired single integer output.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `tuple_to_int` that takes a tuple as an argument.
   - Initialize an empty string to hold the concatenated result.
   - Loop through each integer in the tuple:
     - Convert the integer to a string and append it to the result string.
   - Convert the final concatenated string back to an integer.
   - Return the resulting integer.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    # Balanced Ternary

    !["Setun computer using Balanced Ternary system"](https://earltcampbell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/setun.jpeg?w=300)

    This is a non-standard but still positional **numeral system**. Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.
    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,
    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the
    computers utilizing it.

    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:

    ```nohighlight
        0    0
        1    1
        2    1Z
        3    10
        4    11
        5    1ZZ
        6    1Z0
        7    1Z1
        8    10Z
        9    100
    ```

    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.

    ```nohighlight
        -1   Z
        -2   Z1
        -3   Z0
        -4   ZZ
        -5   Z11
    ```

    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.

    ## Conversion algorithm

    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is
    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,
    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -
    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.

    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.

    The final result is `1Z101`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \cdot 1 + 27 \cdot (-1) + 9 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$

    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.

    The final result is `100Z10`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \cdot 1 + 81 \cdot 0 + 27 \cdot 0 + 9 \cdot (-1) + 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }
