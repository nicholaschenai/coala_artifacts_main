Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.\n    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,\n    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the\n    computers utilizing it.\n\n    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:\n\n    ```nohighlight\n        0    0\n        1    1\n        2    1Z\n        3    10\n        4    11\n        5    1ZZ\n        6    1Z0\n        7    1Z1\n        8    10Z\n        9    100\n    ```\n\n    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.\n\n    ```nohighlight\n        -1   Z\n        -2   Z1\n        -3   Z0\n        -4   ZZ\n        -5   Z11\n    ```\n\n    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.\n\n    ## Conversion algorithm\n\n    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is\n    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,\n    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -\n    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.\n\n    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n\n    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$\n\n    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:\n\n    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.\n\n    The final result is `1Z101`.\n\n    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n\n    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \\cdot 1 + 27 \\cdot (-1) + 9 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$\n\n    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n\n    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$\n\n    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:\n\n    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.\n    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.\n    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.\n\n    The final result is `100Z10`.\n\n    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n\n    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \\cdot 1 + 81 \\cdot 0 + 27 \\cdot 0 + 9 \\cdot (-1) + 3 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n    Part: 2/5\n    <div id=\"the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation\"></div>\n    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }\n\n    Consider the following equation:\n\n    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$\n\n    where $0 \\le x_i \\le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\\ldots 6)$.\n\n    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.\n\n    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):\n    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:\n\n    $$N_0 = \\binom{25}{5}$$\n\n    We will now calculate the number of \"bad\" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The \"bad\" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.\n\n    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \\ge 9$, and all other $x_i \\ge 0 ~ (i \\ne k)$ (they may be $\\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:\n\n    $$ | A_k | = \\binom{16}{5} $$\n\n    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \\ne p$) is equal to:\n\n    $$ \\left| A_k \\cap A_p \\right| = \\binom{7}{5}$$\n\n    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.\n\n    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:\n\n    $$\\binom{25}{5} - \\left(\\binom{6}{1} \\cdot \\binom{16}{5} - \\binom{6}{2} \\cdot \\binom{7}{5}\\right) $$\n\n    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval\n\n    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).\n\n    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.\n\n    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\\cdots k)$.\n\n    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:\n\n    $$ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{ r }{ p_i } \\right\\rfloor $$\n\n    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.\n\n    Here is a C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int solve (int n, int r) {\n    \tvector<int> p;\n    \tfor (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)\n    \t\tif (n % i == 0) {\n    \t\t\tp.push_back (i);\n    \t\t\twhile (n % i == 0)\n    \t\t\t\tn /= i;\n    \t\t}\n    \tif (n > 1)\n    \t\tp.push_back (n);\n\n    \tint sum = 0;\n    \tfor (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {\n    \t\tint mult = 1,\n    \t\t\tbits = 0;\n    \t\tfor (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)\n    \t\t\tif (msk & (1<<i)) {\n    \t\t\t\t++bits;\n    \t\t\t\tmult *= p[i];\n    \t\t\t}\n\n    \t\tint cur = r / mult;\n    \t\tif (bits % 2 == 1)\n    \t\t\tsum += cur;\n    \t\telse\n    \t\t\tsum -= cur;\n    \t}\n\n    \treturn r - sum;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
