Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Continued fractions\n    Part: 12/12\n    ```\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            def solve(p, q, N):\n                return p * N * (N + 1) // 2 - q * sum_floor(fraction(p, q), N)\n            ``` \n\n    !!! example \"[Library Checker - Sum of Floor of Linear](https://judge.yosupo.jp/problem/sum_of_floor_of_linear)\"\n        Given $N$, $M$, $A$ and $B$, compute $\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{N-1} \\lfloor \\frac{A \\cdot i + B}{M} \\rfloor$.\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.\n\n        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \\frac{Ax+B}{M}$.\n\n        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$.

Given a prime $n$ and two integers $a$ and $k$, find all $x$ for which:\n\n    $x^k \\equiv a \\pmod n$\n\n    ## The algorithm\n\n    We will solve this problem by reducing it to the [discrete logarithm problem](discrete-log.md).\n\n    Let's apply the concept of a [primitive root](primitive-root.md) modulo $n$. Let $g$ be a primitive root modulo $n$. Note that since $n$ is prime, it must exist, and it can be found in $O(Ans \\cdot \\log \\phi (n) \\cdot \\log n) = O(Ans \\cdot \\log^2 n)$ plus time of factoring $\\phi (n)$.\n\n    We can easily discard the case where $a = 0$. In this case, obviously there is only one answer: $x = 0$.\n\n    Since we know that $n$ is a prime and any number between 1 and $n-1$ can be represented as a power of the primitive root, we can represent the discrete root problem as follows:\n\n    $(g^y)^k \\equiv a \\pmod n$\n\n    where\n\n    $x \\equiv g^y \\pmod n$\n\n    This, in turn, can be rewritten as\n\n    $(g^k)^y \\equiv a \\pmod n$\n\n    Now we have one unknown $y$, which is a discrete logarithm problem. The solution can be found using Shanks' baby-step giant-step algorithm in $O(\\sqrt {n} \\log n)$ (or we can verify that there are no solutions).\n\n    Having found one solution $y_0$, one of solutions of discrete root problem will be $x_0 = g^{y_0} \\pmod n$.\n\n    ## Finding all solutions from one known solution\n\n    To solve the given problem in full, we need to find all solutions knowing one of them: $x_0 = g^{y_0} \\pmod n$.\n\n    Let's recall the fact that a primitive root always has order of $\\phi (n)$, i.e. the smallest power of $g$ which gives 1 is $\\phi (n)$. Therefore, if we add the term $\\phi (n)$ to the exponential, we still get the same value:\n\n    $x^k \\equiv g^{ y_0 \\cdot k + l \\cdot \\phi (n)} \\equiv a \\pmod n \\forall l \\in Z$\n\n    Hence, all the solutions are of the form:\n\n    $x = g^{y_0 + \\frac {l \\cdot \\phi (n)}{k}} \\pmod n \\forall l \\in Z$.\n\n    where $l$ is chosen such that the fraction must be an integer. For this to be true, the numerator has to be divisible by the least common multiple of  $\\phi (n)$ and $k$. Remember that least common multiple of two numbers $lcm(a, b) = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{gcd(a, b)}$; we'll get\n\n    $x = g^{y_0 + i \\frac {\\phi (n)}{gcd(k, \\phi (n))}} \\pmod n \\forall i \\in Z$.\n\n    This is the final formula for all solutions of the discrete root problem.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Here is a full implementation, including procedures for finding the primitive root, discrete log and finding and printing all solutions.\n\n    ```cpp\n    int gcd(int a, int b) {\n    \treturn a ? gcd(b % a, a) : b;\n    }\n \n    int powmod(int a, int b, int p) {\n    \tint res = 1;\n    \twhile (b > 0) {\n    \t\tif (b & 1) {\n    \t\t\tres = res * a % p;\n    \t\t}\n    \t\ta = a * a % p;\n    \t\tb >>= 1;\n    \t}\n    \treturn res;\n    }\n \n    // Finds the primitive root modulo p\n    int generator(int p) {\n    \tvector<int> fact;\n    \tint phi = p-1, n = phi;\n    \tfor (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {\n    \t\tif (n % i == 0) {\n    \t\t\tfact.push_back(i);\n    \t\t\twhile (n % i == 0)\n    \t\t\t\tn /= i;\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    \tif (n > 1)\n    \t\tfact.push_back(n);\n \n    \tfor (int res = 2; res <= p; ++res) {\n    \t\tbool ok = true;\n    \t\tfor (int factor : fact) {\n    \t\t\tif (powmod(res, phi / factor, p) == 1) {\n    \t\t\t\tok = false;\n    \t\t\t\tbreak;\n    \t\t\t}\n    \t\t}\n    \t\tif (ok) return res;\n    \t}\n    \treturn -1;\n    }\n \n    // This program finds all numbers x such that x^k = a (mod n)\n    int main() {\n    \tint n, k, a;\n    \tscanf(\"%d %d %d\", &n, &k, &a);\n    \tif (a == 0) {\n    \t\tputs(\"1\\n0\");\n    \t\treturn 0;\n    \t}\n \n    \tint g = generator(n);\n \n    \t// Baby-step giant-step discrete logarithm algorithm\n    \tint sq = (int) sqrt (n + .0) + 1;\n    \tvector<pair<int, int>> dec(sq);\n    \tfor (int i = 1; i <= sq; ++i)\n    \t\tdec[i-1] = {powmod(g, i * sq * k % (n - 1), n), i};\n    \tsort(dec.begin(), dec.end());\n    \tint any_ans = -1;\n    \tfor (int i = 0; i < sq; ++i) {\n    \t\tint my = powmod(g, i * k % (n - 1), n) * a % n;\n    \t\tauto it = lower_bound(dec.begin(), dec.end(), make_pair(my, 0));\n    \t\tif (it != dec.end() && it->first == my) {\n    \t\t\tany_ans = it->second * sq - i;\n    \t\t\tbreak;\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    \tif (any_ans == -1) {\n    \t\tputs(\"0\");\n    \t\treturn 0;\n    \t}\n \n    \t// Print all possible answers\n    \tint delta = (n-1) / gcd(k, n-1);\n    \tvector<int> ans;\n    \tfor (int cur = any_ans % delta; cur < n-1; cur += delta)\n    \t\tans.push_back(powmod(g, cur, n));\n    \tsort(ans.begin(), ans.end());\n    \tprintf(\"%d\\n\", ans.size());\n    \tfor (int answer : ans)\n    \t\tprintf(\"%d \", answer);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
