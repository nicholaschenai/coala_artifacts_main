    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes three lists: one containing student IDs, another containing student names, and a third containing their corresponding scores. The function should return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a student with their ID as the key, and another dictionary as the value that contains the student's name and score.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We will iterate through the indices of the input lists, and for each index, we will create a dictionary with the student ID as the key. The value will be another dictionary containing the student's name and score. We will collect all these dictionaries into a list and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function convert_list_dictionary(ids, names, scores):\n       create an empty list result\n       for i from 0 to length of ids:\n           create a dictionary with ids[i] as key\n           create a nested dictionary with names[i] and scores[i]\n           append this dictionary to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef convert_list_dictionary(ids, names, scores):\n    # Create an empty list to hold the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the indices of the input lists\n    for i in range(len(ids)):\n        # Create a dictionary for each student\n        student_dict = {ids[i]: {names[i]: scores[i]}}\n        # Append the student dictionary to the result list\n        result.append(student_dict)\n    \n    # Return the final list of dictionaries\n    return result\n```",
