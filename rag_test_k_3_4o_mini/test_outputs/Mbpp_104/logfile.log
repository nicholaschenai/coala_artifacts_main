    Title: Longest increasing subsequence
    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

    \index{sorting}

    \key{Sorting}
    is a fundamental algorithm design problem.
    Many efficient algorithms
    use sorting as a subroutine,
    because it is often easier to process
    data if the elements are in a sorted order.

    For example, the problem ''does an array contain
    two equal elements?'' is easy to solve using sorting.
    If the array contains two equal elements,
    they will be next to each other after sorting,
    so it is easy to find them.
    Also, the problem ''what is the most frequent element
    in an array?'' can be solved similarly.

    There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are
    also good examples of how to apply
    different algorithm design techniques.
    The efficient general sorting algorithms
    work in $O(n \log n)$ time,
    and many algorithms that use sorting
    as a subroutine also
    have this time complexity.

    \section{Sorting theory}

    The basic problem in sorting is as follows:
    \begin{framed}
    \noindent
    Given an array that contains $n$ elements,
    your task is to sort the elements
    in increasing order.
    \end{framed}
    \noindent
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    will be as follows after sorting:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};

    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{$O(n^2)$ algorithms}

    \index{bubble sort}

    Simple algorithms for sorting an array
    work in $O(n^2)$ time.
    Such algorithms are short and usually
    consist of two nested loops.
    A famous $O(n^2)$ time sorting algorithm
    is \key{bubble sort} where the elements
    ''bubble'' in the array according to their values.

    Bubble sort consists of $n$ rounds.
    On each round, the algorithm iterates through
    the elements of the array.
    Whenever two consecutive elements are found
    that are not in correct order,
    the algorithm swaps them.
    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) {
            if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
                swap(array[j],array[j+1]);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    After the first round of the algorithm,
    the largest element will be in the correct position,
    and in general, after $k$ rounds, the $k$ largest
    elements will be in the correct positions.
    Thus, after $n$ rounds, the whole array
    will be sorted.

    For example, in the array

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \noindent
    the first round of bubble sort swaps elements
    as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Inversions}

    \index{inversion}

    Bubble sort is an example of a sorting
    algorithm that always swaps \emph{consecutive}
    elements in the array.
    It turns out that the time complexity
    of such an algorithm is \emph{always}
    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,
    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.

    A useful concept when analyzing sorting
    algorithms is an \key{inversion}:
    a pair of array elements
    $(\texttt{array}[a],\texttt{array}[b])$ such that
    $a<b$ and $\texttt{array}[a]>\texttt{array}[b]$,
    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    has three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.
    The number of inversions indicates
    how much work is needed to sort the array.
    An array is completely sorted when
    there are no inversions.
    On the other hand, if the array elements
    are in the reverse order,
    the number of inversions is the largest possible:
    \[1+2+\cdots+(n-1)=\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\]

    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are
    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion
    from the array.
    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only
    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes
    at most one inversion, and the time complexity
    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{$O(n \log n)$ algorithms}

    \index{merge sort}

    It is possible to sort an array efficiently
    in $O(n \log n)$ time using algorithms
    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.
    One such algorithm is \key{merge sort}\footnote{According to \cite{knu983},
    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},
    which is based on recursion.

    Merge sort sorts a subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$ as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.
    \item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\lfloor (a+b)/2 \rfloor$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$.
    \item \emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and
    \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    into a sorted subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$.
    \end{enumerate}

    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it
    halves the size of the subarray at each step.
    The recursion consists of $O(\log n)$ levels,
    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.
    Merging the subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.

    For example, consider sorting the following array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9

    Chapter: Sorting
    Section: Sorting theory
    Part: 2/2
    $};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The array will be divided into two subarrays
    as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,1);
    \draw (5,0) grid (9,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};

    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Then, the subarrays will be sorted recursively
    as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,1);
    \draw (5,0) grid (9,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};

    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Finally, the algorithm merges the sorted
    subarrays and creates the final sorted array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Sorting lower bound}

    Is it possible to sort an array faster
    than in $O(n \log n)$ time?
    It turns out that this is \emph{not} possible
    when we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms
    that are based on comparing array elements.

    The lower bound for the time complexity
    can be proved by considering sorting
    as a process where each comparison of two elements
    gives more information about the contents of the array.
    The process creates the following tree:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) rectangle (3,1);
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (-2.5,-1.5);
    \draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (5.5,-1.5);

    \draw (-4,-2.5) rectangle (-1,-1.5);
    \draw (4,-2.5) rectangle (7,-1.5);
    \node at (-2.5,-2) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (5.5,-2) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-4.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-0.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (3.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (7.5,-4);

    \draw (-6,-5) rectangle (-3,-4);
    \draw (-2,-5) rectangle (1,-4);
    \draw (2,-5) rectangle (5,-4);
    \draw (6,-5) rectangle (9,-4);
    \node at (-4.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (-0.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (3.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (7.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-5.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-3.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (0.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (-1.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (2.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (4.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (6.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (8.5,-6);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Here ''$x<y?$'' means that some elements
    $x$ and $y$ are compared.
    If $x<y$, the process continues to the left,
    and otherwise to the right.
    The results of the process are the possible
    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.
    For this reason, the height of the tree
    must be at least
    \[ \log_2(n!) = \log_2(1)+\log_2(2)+\cdots+\log_2(n).\]
    We get a lower bound for this sum
    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and
    changing the value of each element to $\log_2(n/2)$.
    This yields an estimate
    \[ \log_2(n!) \ge (n/2) \cdot \log_2(n/2),\]
    so the height of the tree and the minimum
    possible number of steps in a sorting
    algorithm in the worst case
    is at least $n \log n$.

    \subsubsection{Counting sort}

    \index{counting sort}

    The lower bound $n \log n$ does not apply to
    algorithms that do not compare array elements
    but use some other information.
    An example of such an algorithm is
    \key{counting sort} that sorts an array in
    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array
    is an integer between $0 \ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.

    The algorithm creates a \emph{bookkeeping} array,
    whose indices are elements of the original array.
    The algorithm iterates through the original array
    and calculates how many times each element
    appears in the array.
    \newpage

    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    corresponds to the following bookkeeping array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (9,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$3$};

    \footnotesize

    \node at (0.5,1.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,1.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,1.5) {$3$};
    \node at (3.5,1.5) {$4$};
    \node at (4.5,1.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,1.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,1.5) {$7$};
    \node at (7.5,1.5) {$8$};
    \node at (8.5,1.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    For example, the value at position 3
    in the bookkeeping array is 2,
    because the element 3 appears 2 times
    in the original array.

    Construction of the bookkeeping array
    takes $O(n)$ time. After this, the sorted array
    can be created in $O(n)$ time because
    the number of occurrences of each element can be retrieved
    from the bookkeeping array.
    Thus, the total time complexity of counting
    sort is $O(n)$.

    Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm
    but it can only be used when the constant $c$
    is small enough, so that the array elements can
    be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.
