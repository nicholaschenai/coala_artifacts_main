i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0;

\\emph{consecutive}\n    elements in the array.\n    It turns out that the time complexity\n    of such an algorithm is \\emph{always}\n    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,\n    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.\n\n    A useful concept when analyzing sorting\n    algorithms is an \\key{inversion}:\n    a pair of array elements\n    $(\\texttt{array}[a],\\texttt{array}[b])$ such that\n    $a<b$ and $\\texttt{array}[a]>\\texttt{array}[b]$,\n    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at

three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.\n    The number of inversions indicates\n    how much work is needed to sort the array.\n    An array is completely sorted when\n    there are no inversions.\n    On the other hand, if the array elements\n    are in the reverse order,\n    the number of inversions is the largest possible:\n    \\[1+2+\\cdots+(n-1)=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\\]\n\n    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are\n    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion\n    from the array.\n    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only\n    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes\n    at most one inversion, and the time complexity\n    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{$O(n \\log n)$ algorithms}\n\n    \\index{merge sort}\n\n    It is possible to sort an array efficiently\n    in $O(n \\log n)$ time using algorithms\n    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.\n    One such algorithm is \\key{merge sort}\\footnote{According to \\cite{knu983},\n    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},\n    which is based on recursion.\n\n    Merge sort sorts a subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$ as follows:\n\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.\n    \\item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\\lfloor (a+b)/2 \\rfloor$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$.\n    \\item \\emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and\n    \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    into a sorted subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it\n    halves the size of the subarray at each step.\n    The recursion consists of $O(\\log n)$ levels,\n    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.\n    Merging the subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.\n\n    For example, consider sorting the following array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at

out that this is \\emph{not} possible\n    when we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms\n    that are based on comparing array elements.\n\n    The lower bound for the time complexity\n    can be proved by considering sorting\n    as a process where each comparison of two elements\n    gives more information about the contents of the array.\n    The process creates the following tree:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) rectangle (3,1);\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (-2.5,-1.5);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (5.5,-1.5);\n\n    \\draw (-4,-2.5) rectangle (-1,-1.5);\n    \\draw (4,-2.5) rectangle (7,-1.5);\n    \\node at (-2.5,-2) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (5.5,-2) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-4.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-0.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (3.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (7.5,-4);\n\n    \\draw (-6,-5) rectangle (-3,-4);\n    \\draw (-2,-5) rectangle (1,-4);\n    \\draw (2,-5) rectangle (5,-4);\n    \\draw (6,-5) rectangle (9,-4);\n    \\node at (-4.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (-0.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (3.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (7.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-5.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-3.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (0.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (-1.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (2.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (4.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (6.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (8.5,-6);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Here ''$x<y?$'' means that some elements\n    $x$ and $y$ are compared.\n    If $x<y$, the process continues to the left,\n    and otherwise to the right.\n    The results of the process are the possible\n    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.\n    For this reason, the height of the tree\n    must be at least\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) = \\log_2(1)+\\log_2(2)+\\cdots+\\log_2(n).\\]\n    We get a lower bound for this sum\n    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and\n    changing the value of each element to $\\log_2(n/2)$.\n    This yields an estimate\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) \\ge (n/2) \\cdot \\log_2(n/2),\\]\n    so the height of the tree and the minimum\n    possible number of steps in a sorting\n    algorithm in the worst case\n    is at least $n \\log n$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Counting sort}\n\n    \\index{counting sort}\n\n    The lower bound $n \\log n$ does not apply to\n    algorithms that do not compare array elements\n    but use some other information.\n    An example of such an algorithm is\n    \\key{counting sort} that sorts an array in\n    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array\n    is an integer between $0 \\ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.\n\n    The algorithm creates a \\emph{bookkeeping} array,\n    whose indices are elements of the original array.\n    The algorithm iterates through the original array\n    and calculates how many times each element\n    appears in the array.\n    \\newpage\n\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    corresponds to the following bookkeeping array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (9,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (8.5,0.5) {$3$};\n\n    \\footnotesize\n\n    \\node at (0.5,1.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,1.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,1.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (3.5,1.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (4.5,1.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (5.5,1.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (6.5,1.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (7.5,1.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (8.5,1.5) {$9$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    For example, the value at position 3\n    in the bookkeeping array is 2,\n    because the element 3 appears 2 times\n    in the original array.\n\n    Construction of the bookkeeping array\n    takes $O(n)$ time. After this, the sorted array\n    can be created in $O(n)$ time because\n    the number of occurrences of each element can be retrieved\n    from the bookkeeping array.\n    Thus, the total time complexity of counting\n    sort is $O(n)$.\n\n    Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm\n    but it can only be used when the constant $c$\n    is small enough, so that the array elements can\n    be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
