    Chapter: Introduction
    Section: Input and output
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Input and output}

    \index{input and output}

    In most contests, standard streams are used for
    reading input and writing output.
    In C++, the standard streams are
    \texttt{cin} for input and \texttt{cout} for output.
    In addition, the C functions
    \texttt{scanf} and \texttt{printf} can be used.

    The input for the program usually consists of
    numbers and strings that are separated with
    spaces and newlines.
    They can be read from the \texttt{cin} stream
    as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a, b;
    string x;
    cin >> a >> b >> x;
    \end{lstlisting}

    This kind of code always works,
    assuming that there is at least one space
    or newline between each element in the input.
    For example, the above code can read
    both of the following inputs:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    123 456 monkey
    \end{lstlisting}
    \begin{lstlisting}
    123    456
    monkey
    \end{lstlisting}
    The \texttt{cout} stream is used for output
    as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a = 123, b = 456;
    string x = "monkey";
    cout << a << " " << b << " " << x << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    Input and output is sometimes
    a bottleneck in the program.
    The following lines at the beginning of the code
    make input and output more efficient:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that the newline \texttt{"\textbackslash n"}
    works faster than \texttt{endl},
    because \texttt{endl} always causes
    a flush operation.

    The C functions \texttt{scanf}
    and \texttt{printf} are an alternative
    to the C++ standard streams.
    They are usually a bit faster,
    but they are also more difficult to use.
    The following code reads two integers from the input:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    \end{lstlisting}
    The following code prints two integers:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a = 123, b = 456;
    printf("%d %d\n", a, b);
    \end{lstlisting}

    Sometimes the program should read a whole line
    from the input, possibly containing spaces.
    This can be accomplished by using the
    \texttt{getline} function:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    string s;
    getline(cin, s);
    \end{lstlisting}

    If the amount of data is unknown, the following
    loop is useful:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    while (cin >> x) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    This loop reads elements from the input
    one after another, until there is no
    more data available in the input.

    In some contest systems, files are used for
    input and output.
    An easy solution for this is to write
    the code as usual using standard streams,
    but add the following lines to the beginning of the code:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this, the program reads the input from the file
    ''input.txt'' and writes the output to the file
    ''output.txt''.

    Section: Calculation rules
    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{Time complexity}

    \index{time complexity}

    The efficiency of algorithms is important in competitive programming.
    Usually, it is easy to design an algorithm
    that solves the problem slowly,
    but the real challenge is to invent a
    fast algorithm.
    If the algorithm is too slow, it will get only
    partial points or no points at all.

    The \key{time complexity} of an algorithm
    estimates how much time the algorithm will use
    for some input.
    The idea is to represent the efficiency
    as a function whose parameter is the size of the input.
    By calculating the time complexity,
    we can find out whether the algorithm is fast enough
    without implementing it.

    \section{Calculation rules}

    The time complexity of an algorithm
    is denoted $O(\cdots)$
    where the three dots represent some
    function.
    Usually, the variable $n$ denotes
    the input size.
    For example, if the input is an array of numbers,
    $n$ will be the size of the array,
    and if the input is a string,
    $n$ will be the length of the string.

    \subsubsection*{Loops}

    A common reason why an algorithm is slow is
    that it contains many loops that go through the input.
    The more nested loops the algorithm contains,
    the slower it is.
    If there are $k$ nested loops,
    the time complexity is $O(n^k)$.

    For example, the time complexity of the following code is $O(n)$:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    And the time complexity of the following code is $O(n^2)$:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            // code
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection*{Order of magnitude}

    A time complexity does not tell us the exact number
    of times the code inside a loop is executed,
    but it only shows the order of magnitude.
    In the following examples, the code inside the loop
    is executed $3n$, $n+5$ and $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ times,
    but the time complexity of each code is $O(n)$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3*n; i++) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n+5; i++) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 2) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    As another example,
    the time complexity of the following code is $O(n^2)$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = i+1; j <= n; j++) {
            // code
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection*{Phases}

    If the algorithm consists of consecutive phases,
    the total time complexity is the largest
    time complexity of a single phase.
    The reason for this is that the slowest
    phase is usually the bottleneck of the code.

    For example, the following code consists
    of three phases with time complexities
    $O(n)$, $O(n^2)$ and $O(n)$.
    Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // code
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            // code
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection*{Several variables}

    Sometimes the time complexity depends on
    several factors.
    In this case, the time complexity formula
    contains several variables.

    For example, the time complexity of the
    following code is $O(nm)$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            // code
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection*{Recursion}

    The time complexity of a recursive function
    depends on the number of times the function is called
    and the time complexity of a single call.
    The total time complexity is the product of
    these values.

    For example, consider the following function:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    void f(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return;
        f(n-1);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    The call $\texttt{f}(n)$ causes $n$ function calls,
    and the time complexity of each call is $O(1)$.
    Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n)$.

    As another example, consider the following function:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    void g(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return;
        g(n-1);
        g(n-1);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    In this case each function call generates two other
    calls, except for $n=1$.
    Let us see what happens when $g$ is called
    with parameter $n$.
    The following table shows the function calls
    produced by this single call:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rr}
    function call & number of calls \\
    \hline
    $g(n)$ & 1 \\
    $g(n-1)$ & 2 \\
    $g(n-2)$ & 4 \\
    $\cdots$ & $\cdots$ \\
    $g(1)$ & $2^{n-1}$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    Based on this, the time complexity is
    \[1+2+4+\cdots+2^{n-1} = 2^n-1 = O(2^n).\]

    Title: Finding the equation of a line for a segment
    Part: 1/1
    # Finding the equation of a line for a segment

    The task is: given the coordinates of the ends of a segment, construct a line passing through it.

    We assume that the segment is non-degenerate, i.e. has a length greater than zero (otherwise, of course, infinitely many different lines pass through it).

    ### Two-dimensional case

    Let the given segment be $PQ$ i.e. the known coordinates of its ends $P_x , P_y , Q_x , Q_y$ .

    It is necessary to construct **the equation of a line in the plane** passing through this segment, i.e. find the coefficients $A , B , C$ in the equation of a line:

    $$A x + B y + C = 0.$$

    Note that for the required triples $(A, B, C)$ there are **infinitely many** solutions which describe the given segment:
    you can multiply all three coefficients by an arbitrary non-zero number and get the same straight line.
    Therefore, our task is to find one of these triples.

    It is easy to verify (by substitution of these expressions and the coordinates of the points $P$ and $Q$ into the equation of a straight line) that the following set of coefficients fits:

    $$\begin{align}
    A &= P_y - Q_y, \\
    B &= Q_x - P_x, \\
    C &= - A P_x - B P_y.
    \end{align}$$

    ### Integer case

    An important advantage of this method of constructing a straight line is that if the coordinates of the ends were integer, then the coefficients obtained will also be **integer** . In some cases, this allows one to perform geometric operations without resorting to real numbers at all.

    However, there is a small drawback: for the same straight line different triples of coefficients can be obtained.
    To avoid this, but do not go away from the integer coefficients, you can apply the following technique, often called **rationing**. Find the [greatest common divisor](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md) of numbers $| A | , | B | , | C |$ , we divide all three coefficients by it, and then we make the normalization of the sign: if $A <0$ or $A = 0, B <0$ then multiply all three coefficients by $-1$ .
    As a result, we will come to the conclusion that for identical straight lines, identical triples of coefficients will be obtained, which makes it easy to check straight lines for equality.

    ### Real case

    When working with real numbers, you should always be aware of errors.

    The coefficients $A$ and $B$ will have the order of the original coordinates, the coefficient $C$ is of the order of the square of them. This may already be quite large numbers, and, for example, when we [intersect straight lines](lines-intersection.md), they will become even larger, which can lead to large rounding errors already when the coordinates of the end points are of order $10^3$.

    Therefore, when working with real numbers, it is desirable to produce the so-called **normalization**, this is straightforward: namely, to make the coefficients such that $A ^ 2 + B ^ 2 = 1$ . To do this, calculate the number $Z$ :

    $$Z = \sqrt{A ^ 2 + B ^ 2},$$

    and divide all three coefficients $A , B , C$ by it.

    Thus, the order of the coefficients $A$ and $B$ will not depend on the order of the input coordinates, and the coefficient $C$ will be of the same order as the input coordinates. In practice, this leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of calculations.

    Finally, we mention the **comparison** of straight lines - in fact, after such a normalization, for the same straight line, only two triples of coefficients can be obtained: up to multiplication by $-1$.
    Accordingly, if we make an additional normalization taking into account the sign (if $A < -\varepsilon$  or $| A | < \varepsilon$, $B <- \varepsilon$ then multiply by $-1$ ), the resulting coefficients will be unique.

    ### Three-dimensional and multidimensional case

    Already in the three-dimensional case there is **no simple equation** describing a straight line (it can be defined as the intersection of two planes, that is, a system of two equations, but this is an inconvenient method).

    Consequently, in the three-dimensional and multidimensional cases we must use the **parametric method of defining a straight line** , i.e. as a point $p$ and a vector $v$ :

    $$p + v t, ~~~ t \in \mathbb{R}.$$

    Those. a straight line is all points that can be obtained from a point $p$ adding a vector $v$ with an arbitrary coefficient.

    The **construction** of a straight line in a parametric form along the coordinates of the ends of a segment is trivial, we just take one end of the segment for the point $p$, and the vector from the first to the second end — for the vector $v$.
