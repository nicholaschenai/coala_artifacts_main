output}\n\n    In most contests, standard streams are used for\n    reading input and writing output.\n    In C++, the standard streams are\n    \\texttt{cin} for input and \\texttt{cout} for output.\n    In addition, the C functions\n    \\texttt{scanf} and \\texttt{printf} can be used.\n\n    The input for the program usually consists of\n    numbers and strings that are separated with\n    spaces and newlines.\n    They can be read from the \\texttt{cin} stream\n    as follows:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int a, b;\n    string x;\n    cin >> a >> b >> x;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    This kind of code always works,\n    assuming that there is at least one space\n    or newline between each element in the input.\n    For example, the above code can read\n    both of the following inputs:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    123 456 monkey\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    123    456\n    monkey\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    The \\texttt{cout} stream is used for output\n    as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int a = 123, b = 456;\n    string x = \"monkey\";\n    cout << a << \" \" << b << \" \" << x << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Input and output is sometimes\n    a bottleneck in the program.\n    The following lines at the beginning of the code\n    make input and output more efficient:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);\n    cin.tie(0);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Note that the newline \\texttt{\"\\textbackslash n\"}\n    works faster than \\texttt{endl},\n    because \\texttt{endl} always causes\n    a flush operation.\n\n    The C functions \\texttt{scanf}\n    and \\texttt{printf} are an alternative\n    to the C++ standard streams.\n    They are usually a bit faster,\n    but they are also more difficult to use.\n    The following code reads two integers from the input:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int a, b;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    The following code prints two integers:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int a = 123, b = 456;\n    printf(\"%d %d\\n\", a, b);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Sometimes the program should read a whole line\n    from the input, possibly containing spaces.\n    This can be accomplished by using the\n    \\texttt{getline} function:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    string s;\n    getline(cin, s);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    If the amount of data is unknown, the following\n    loop is useful:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    while (cin >> x) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    This loop reads elements from the input\n    one after another, until there is no\n    more data available in the input.\n\n    In some contest systems, files are used for\n    input and output.\n    An easy solution for this is to write\n    the code as usual using standard streams,\n    but add the following lines to the beginning of the code:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    freopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n    freopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this, the program reads the input from the file\n    ''input.txt'' and writes the output to the file\n    ''output.txt''.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Time complexity\n    Section: Calculation rules\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\chapter{Time complexity}\n\n    \\index{time complexity}\n\n    The efficiency of algorithms is important in competitive programming.\n    Usually, it is easy to design an algorithm\n    that solves the problem slowly,\n    but the real challenge is to invent a\n    fast algorithm.\n    If the algorithm is too slow, it will get only\n    partial points or no points at all.\n\n    The \\key{time complexity} of an algorithm\n    estimates how much time the algorithm will use\n    for some input.\n    The idea is to represent the efficiency\n    as a function whose parameter is the size of the input.\n    By calculating the time complexity,\n    we can find out whether the algorithm is fast enough\n    without implementing it.\n\n    \\section{Calculation rules}\n\n    The time complexity of an algorithm\n    is denoted $O(\\cdots)$\n    where the three dots represent some\n    function.\n    Usually, the variable $n$ denotes\n    the input size.\n    For example, if the input is an array of numbers,\n    $n$ will be the size of the array,\n    and if the input is a string,\n    $n$ will be the length of the string.\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Loops}\n\n    A common reason why an algorithm is slow is\n    that it contains many loops that go through the input.\n    The more nested loops the algorithm contains,\n    the slower it is.\n    If there are $k$ nested loops,\n    the time complexity is $O(n^k)$.\n\n    For example, the time complexity of the following code is $O(n)$:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    And the time complexity of the following code is $O(n^2)$:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {\n            // code\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Order of magnitude}\n\n    A time complexity does not tell us the exact number\n    of times the code inside a loop is executed,\n    but it only shows the order of magnitude.\n    In the following examples, the code inside the loop\n    is executed $3n$, $n+5$ and $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$ times,\n    but the time complexity of each code is $O(n)$.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= 3*n; i++) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n+5; i++) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 2) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    As another example,\n    the time complexity of the following code is $O(n^2)$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        for (int j = i+1; j <= n; j++) {\n            // code\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Phases}\n\n    If the algorithm consists of consecutive phases,\n    the total time complexity is the largest\n    time complexity of a single phase.\n    The reason for this is that the slowest\n    phase is usually the bottleneck of the code.\n\n    For example, the following code consists\n    of three phases with time complexities\n    $O(n)$, $O(n^2)$ and $O(n)$.\n    Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n^2)$.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        // code\n    }\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {\n            // code\n        }\n    }\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Several variables}\n\n    Sometimes the time complexity depends on\n    several factors.\n    In this case, the time complexity formula\n    contains several variables.\n\n    For example, the time complexity of the\n    following code is $O(nm)$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {\n            // code\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Recursion}\n\n    The time complexity of a recursive function\n    depends on the number of times the function is called\n    and the time complexity of a single call.\n    The total time complexity is the product of\n    these values.\n\n    For example, consider the following function:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void f(int n) {\n        if (n == 1) return;\n        f(n-1);\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    The call $\\texttt{f}(n)$ causes $n$ function calls,\n    and the time complexity of each call is $O(1)$.\n    Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n)$.\n\n    As another example, consider the following function:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void g(int n) {\n        if (n == 1) return;\n        g(n-1);\n        g(n-1);\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    In this case each function call generates two other\n    calls, except for $n=1$.\n    Let us see what happens when $g$ is called\n    with parameter $n$.\n    The following table shows the function calls\n    produced by this single call:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rr}\n    function call & number of calls \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $g(n)$ & 1 \\\\\n    $g(n-1)$ & 2 \\\\\n    $g(n-2)$ & 4 \\\\\n    $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ \\\\\n    $g(1)$ & $2^{n-1}$ \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n    Based on this, the time complexity is\n    \\[1+2+4+\\cdots+2^{n-1} = 2^n-1 = O(2^n).\\]\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Finding the equation of a line for a segment\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Finding the equation of a line for a segment\n\n    The task is: given the coordinates of the ends of a segment, construct a line passing through it.\n\n    We assume that the segment is non-degenerate, i.e. has a length greater than zero (otherwise, of course, infinitely many different lines pass through it).\n\n    ### Two-dimensional case\n\n    Let the given segment be $PQ$ i.e. the known coordinates of its ends $P_x , P_y , Q_x , Q_y$ .\n\n    It is necessary to construct **the equation of a line in the plane** passing through this segment, i.e. find the coefficients $A , B , C$ in the equation of a line:\n\n    $$A x + B y + C = 0.$$\n\n    Note that for the required triples $(A, B, C)$ there are **infinitely many** solutions which describe the given segment:\n    you can multiply all three coefficients by an arbitrary non-zero number and get the same straight line.\n    Therefore, our task is to find one of these triples.\n\n    It is easy to verify (by substitution of these expressions and the coordinates of the points $P$ and $Q$ into the equation of a straight line) that the following set of coefficients fits:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    A &= P_y - Q_y, \\\\\n    B &= Q_x - P_x, \\\\\n    C &= - A P_x - B P_y.\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    ### Integer case\n\n    An important advantage of this method of constructing a straight line is that if the coordinates of the ends were integer, then the coefficients obtained will also be **integer** . In some cases, this allows one to perform geometric operations without resorting to real numbers at all.\n\n    However, there is a small drawback: for the same straight line different triples of coefficients can be obtained.\n    To avoid this, but do not go away from the integer coefficients, you can apply the following technique, often called **rationing**. Find the [greatest common divisor](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md) of numbers $| A | , | B | , | C |$ , we divide all three coefficients by it, and then we make the normalization of the sign: if $A <0$ or $A = 0, B <0$ then multiply all three coefficients by $-1$ .\n    As a result, we will come to the conclusion that for identical straight lines, identical triples of coefficients will be obtained, which makes it easy to check straight lines for equality.\n\n    ### Real case\n\n    When working with real numbers, you should always be aware of errors.\n\n    The coefficients $A$ and $B$ will have the order of the original coordinates, the coefficient $C$ is of the order of the square of them. This may already be quite large numbers, and, for example, when we [intersect straight lines](lines-intersection.md), they will become even larger, which can lead to large rounding errors already when the coordinates of the end points are of order $10^3$.\n\n    Therefore, when working with real numbers, it is desirable to produce the so-called **normalization**, this is straightforward: namely, to make the coefficients such that $A ^ 2 + B ^ 2 = 1$ . To do this, calculate the number $Z$ :\n\n    $$Z = \\sqrt{A ^ 2 + B ^ 2},$$\n\n    and divide all three coefficients $A , B , C$ by it.\n\n    Thus, the order of the coefficients $A$ and $B$ will not depend on the order of the input coordinates, and the coefficient $C$ will be of the same order as the input coordinates. In practice, this leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of calculations.\n\n    Finally, we mention the **comparison** of straight lines - in fact, after such a normalization, for the same straight line, only two triples of coefficients can be obtained: up to multiplication by $-1$.\n    Accordingly, if we make an additional normalization taking into account the sign (if $A < -\\varepsilon$  or $| A | < \\varepsilon$, $B <- \\varepsilon$ then multiply by $-1$ ), the resulting coefficients will be unique.\n\n    ### Three-dimensional and multidimensional case\n\n    Already in the three-dimensional case there is **no simple equation** describing a straight line (it can be defined as the intersection of two planes, that is, a system of two equations, but this is an inconvenient method).\n\n    Consequently, in the three-dimensional and multidimensional cases we must use the **parametric method of defining a straight line** , i.e. as a point $p$ and a vector $v$ :\n\n    $$p + v t, ~~~ t \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\n\n    Those. a straight line is all points that can be obtained from a point $p$ adding a vector $v$ with an arbitrary coefficient.\n\n    The **construction** of a straight line in a parametric form along the coordinates of the ends of a segment is trivial, we just take one end of the segment for the point $p$, and the vector from the first to the second end \u2014 for the vector $v$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
