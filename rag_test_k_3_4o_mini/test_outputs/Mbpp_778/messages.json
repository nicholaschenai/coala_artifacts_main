numbers: $a[0 \\dots n-1]$.\n    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.\n\n    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \\dots i_k$ such that\n\n    $$i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k,\\quad\n    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \\dots < a[i_k]$$\n\n    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.\n    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.\n\n    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label=\"Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming\"}\n\n    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.\n    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.\n\n    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.\n\n    ### Finding the length\n\n    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \\dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.\n\n    !!! example\n\n        $$\\begin{array}{ll}\n        a &= \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\} \\\\\n        d &= \\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\\}\n        \\end{array}$$\n\n        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\\}$ or $\\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\\{0, 1\\}$ having length 2.\n\n    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.\n    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.\n\n    So let the current index be $i$.\n    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \\dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.\n    Then there are two options:\n\n    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.\n\n    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.\n        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.\n\n        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.\n        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.\n  \n        $$d[i] = \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(1, \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)\\right)$$\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {\n                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;\n                    p[i] = j;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if (d[i] > ans) {\n                ans = d[i];\n                pos = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        vector<int> subseq;\n        while (pos != -1) {\n            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);\n            pos = p[pos];\n        }\n        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());\n        return subseq;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Longest increasing subsequence\n    Part: 3/3\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    It is also possible to restore the subsequence using this approach.\n    This time we have to maintain two auxiliary arrays.\n    One that tells us the index of the elements in $d[]$.\n    And again we have to create an array of \"ancestors\" $p[i]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index of the previous element for the optimal subsequence ending in element $i$.\n\n    It's easy to maintain these two arrays in the course of iteration over the array $a[]$ alongside the computations of $d[]$.\n    And at the end it is not difficult to restore the desired subsequence using these arrays.\n\n    ## Solution in $O(n \\log n)$ with data structures {data-toc-label=\"Solution in O(n log n) with data structures\"}\n\n    Instead of the above method for computing the longest increasing subsequence in $O(n \\log n)$ we can also solve the problem in a different way: using some simple data structures.\n\n    Let's go back to the first method.\n    Remember that $d[i]$ is the value $d[j] + 1$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n    Thus if we define an additional array $t[]$ such that\n\n    $$t[a[i]] = d[i],$$\n\n    then the problem of computing the value $d[i]$ is equivalent to finding the **maximum value in a prefix** of the array $t[]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(t[0 \\dots a[i] - 1] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. \n    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).\n\n    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:\n    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.\n    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).\n    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.\n\n    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:\n    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.\n    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).\n\n    ## Related tasks\n\n    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence\n\n    This is in fact nearly the same problem.\n    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.\n\n    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.\n    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.\n\n    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences\n\n    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.\n    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.\n\n    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.\n    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.\n\n    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.\n\n    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence\n\n    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \\dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.\n\n    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    **Proof**:\n    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.\n\n    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.\n    We need to prove that $x = y$.\n\n    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.\n    Therefore we have $y \\ge x$.\n\n    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.\n    Suppose that $y > x$.\n    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.\n    We transform this in set in the following way:\n    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.\n    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.\n    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.\n\n    Thus it follows that $y = x$.\n\n    **Restoring the sequences**:\n    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.\n    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Generating all $K$-combinations\n\n    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.\n    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.\n    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.\n\n    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label=\"Generate next lexicographical K-combination\"}\n\n    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.\n    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how\n    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our\n    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once\n    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent\n    elements.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}\n    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {\n        int k = (int)a.size();\n        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {\n                a[i]++;\n                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)\n                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label=\"Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element\"}\n\n    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such\n    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.\n\n    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):\n    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.\n\n    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:\n    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.\n    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the\n    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove\n    a number, add a number).\n\n    Let us prove this:\n\n    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can \n    be obtained as follows:\n\n    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \\cup 1G(N-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the \n    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and\n    concatenate these two sequences.\n\n    Now we may produce our proof.\n\n    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note\n    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As\n    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.\n    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.\n\n    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.\n\n    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.\n\n    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size\n    $K$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}\n    int gray_code (int n) {\n        return n ^ (n >> 1);\n    }\n\n    int count_bits (int n) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (; n; n >>= 1)\n            res += n & 1;\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {\n            int cur = gray_code (i);\n            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (cur & (1 << j))\n                        cout << j + 1;\n                }\n                cout << \"\\n\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus\n    works in $O\\left(N \\cdot \\binom{N}{K}\\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant\n    than the previous solution.\n\n    The implementation is derived from the formula:\n\n    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \\cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the\n    subsequence from appropriate elements.\n\n    Its implementation is as follows:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}\n    vector<int> ans;\n\n    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {\n        if (k > n || k < 0)\n            return;\n\n        if (!n) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {\n                if (ans[i])\n                    cout << i + 1;\n            }\n            cout << \"\\n\";\n            return;\n        }\n\n        ans[idx] = rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);\n        ans[idx] = !rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {\n        ans.resize(n);\n        gen(n, k, 0, false);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

For example, if the input list is `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]`, the output should be a list of lists where each sublist contains consecutive duplicates, resulting in `[[0, 0], [1], [2], [3], [4, 4], [5], [6, 6, 6], [7], [8], [9], [4, 4]]`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input list while keeping track of the current element and its duplicates. Whenever we encounter a new element (different from the previous one), we can append the current group of duplicates to the result list and start a new group for the new element. At the end of the iteration, we need to ensure that the last group of duplicates is also added to the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function pack_consecutive_duplicates(input_list):\n       if input_list is empty:\n           return empty list\n       \n       result = empty list\n       current_group = empty list\n       previous_element = None\n       \n       for each element in input_list:\n           if element is the same as previous_element:\n               add element to current_group\n           else:\n               if current_group is not empty:\n                   add current_group to result\n               start new current_group with element\n           previous_element = element\n       \n       if current_group is not empty:\n           add current_group to result\n       \n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef pack_consecutive_duplicates(input_list):\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not input_list:\n        return []\n    \n    result = []  # This will hold the final result\n    current_group = []  # This will hold the current group of duplicates\n    previous_element = None  # To keep track of the last element we processed\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the input list\n    for element in input_list:\n        # If the current element is the same as the previous one\n        if element == previous_element:\n            current_group.append(element)  # Add to the current group\n        else:\n            # If we have a current group, add it to the result\n            if current_group:\n                result.append(current_group)\n            current_group = [element]  # Start a new group with the current element\n        previous_element = element  # Update the previous element\n    \n    # After the loop, add the last group if it exists\n    if current_group:\n        result.append(current_group)\n    \n    return result  # Return the final result\n```"
