    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that finds the correct index in a sorted list where a given value can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value is `6`, the function should return `4`, which is the index where `6` would be inserted.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. Since the list is sorted, we can efficiently find the position where the new value should be inserted. We will maintain two pointers (or indices) to represent the current search range and repeatedly narrow down this range until we find the correct insertion point.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function right_insertion(arr, value):\n       set left to 0\n       set right to length of arr\n       \n       while left < right:\n           set mid to (left + right) // 2\n           if arr[mid] <= value:\n               set left to mid + 1\n           else:\n               set right to mid\n       \n       return left\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef right_insertion(arr, value):\n    # Initialize left and right pointers\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr)\n    \n    # Perform binary search\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2  # Find the middle index\n        if arr[mid] <= value:  # If the middle element is less than or equal to the value\n            left = mid + 1  # Move the left pointer to mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid  # Move the right pointer to mid\n    \n    # The left pointer will be the correct insertion point\n    return left\n```",
