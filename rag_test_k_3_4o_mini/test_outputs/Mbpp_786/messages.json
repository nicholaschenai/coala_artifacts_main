Acceleration with \"fractional cascading\".\n\n    We have the same problem statement, we want to find the minimal number greater than or equal to $x$ in a segment, but this time in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n    We will improve the time complexity using the technique \"fractional cascading\".\n\n    Fractional cascading is a simple technique that allows you to improve the running time of multiple binary searches, which are conducted at the same time. \n    Our previous approach to the search query was, that we divide the task into several subtasks, each of which is solved with a binary search. \n    Fractional cascading allows you to replace all of these binary searches with a single one.\n\n    The simplest and most obvious example of fractional cascading is the following problem:\n    there are $k$ sorted lists of numbers, and we must find in each list the first number greater than or equal to the given number.\n\n    Instead of performing a binary search for each list, we could merge all lists into one big sorted list.\n    Additionally for each element $y$ we store a list of results of searching for $y$ in each of the $k$ lists.\n    Therefore if we want to find the smallest number greater than or equal to $x$, we just need to perform one single binary search, and from the list of indices we can determine the smallest number in each list.\n    This approach however requires $O(n \\cdot k)$ ($n$ is the length of the combined lists), which can be quite inefficient. \n\n    Fractional cascading reduces this memory complexity to $O(n)$ memory, by creating from the $k$ input lists $k$ new lists, in which each list contains the corresponding list and additionally also every second element of the following new list.\n    Using this structure it is only necessary to store two indices, the index of the element in the original list, and the index of the element in the following new list.\n    So this approach only uses $O(n)$ memory, and still can answer the queries using a single binary search. \n\n    But for our application we do not need the full power of fractional cascading.\n    In our Segment Tree a vertex will contain the sorted list of all elements that occur in either the left or the right subtrees (like in the Merge Sort Tree). \n    Additionally to this sorted list, we store two positions for each element.\n    For an element $y$ we store the smallest index $i$, such that the $i$th element in the sorted list of the left child is greater or equal to $y$.\n    And we store the smallest index $j$, such that the $j$th element in the sorted list of the right child is greater or equal to $y$.\n    These values can be computed in parallel to the merging step when we build the tree.\n\n    How does this speed up the queries?\n\n    Remember, in the normal solution we did a binary search in ever node.\n    But with this modification, we can avoid all except one.\n\n    To answer a query, we simply to a binary search in the root node.\n    This gives as the smallest element $y \\ge x$ in the complete array, but it also gives us two positions.\n    The index of the smallest element greater or equal $x$ in the left subtree, and the index of the smallest element $y$ in the right subtree. Notice that $\\ge y$ is the same as $\\ge x$, since our array doesn't contain any elements between $x$ and $y$.\n    In the normal Merge Sort Tree solution we would compute these indices via binary search, but with the help of the precomputed values we can just look them up in $O(1)$.\n    And we can repeat that until we visited all nodes that cover our query interval.\n\n    To summarize, as usual we touch $O(\\log n)$ nodes during a query. In the root node we do a binary search, and in all other nodes we only do constant work.\n    This means the complexity for answering a query is $O(\\log n)$.\n\n    But notice, that this uses three times more memory than a normal Merge Sort Tree, which already uses a lot of memory ($O(n \\log n)$).\n\n    It is straightforward to apply this technique to a problem, that doesn't require any modification queries.\n    The two positions are just integers and can easily be computed by counting when merging the two sorted sequences.\n\n    It it still possible to also allow modification queries, but that complicates the entire code.\n    Instead of integers, you need to store the sorted array as `multiset`, and instead of indices you need to store iterators.\n    And you need to work very carefully, so that you increment or decrement the correct iterators during a modification query.\n\n    #### Other possible variations\n\n    This technique implies a whole new class of possible applications. \n    Instead of storing a $\\text{vector}$ or a $\\text{multiset}$ in each vertex, other data structures can be used:\n    other Segment Trees (somewhat discussed in [Generalization to higher dimensions](segment_tree.md#generalization-to-higher-dimensions)), Fenwick Trees, Cartesian trees, etc.\n\n    ### Range updates (Lazy Propagation)\n\n    All problems in the above sections discussed modification queries that only effected a single element of the array each.\n    However the Segment Tree allows applying modification queries to an entire segment of contiguous elements, and perform the query in the same time $O(\\log n)$. \n\n    #### Addition on segments\n\n    We begin by considering problems of the simplest form: the modification query should add a number $x$ to all numbers in the segment $a[l \\dots r]$.\n    The second query, that we are supposed to answer, asked simply for the value of $a[i]$.\n\n    To make the addition query efficient, we store at each vertex in the Segment Tree how many we should add to all numbers in the corresponding segment. \n    For example, if the query \"add 3 to the whole array $a[0 \\dots n-1]$\" comes, then we place the number 3 in the root of the tree.\n    In general we have to place this number to multiple segments, which form a partition of the query segment. \n    Thus we don't have to change all $O(n)$ values, but only $O(\\log n)$ many.\n\n    If now there comes a query that asks the current value of a particular array entry, it is enough to go down the tree and add up all values found along the way.\n\n    ```cpp\n    void build(int a[], int v, int tl, int tr) {\n        if (tl == tr) {\n            t[v] = a[tl];\n        } else {\n            int tm = (tl + tr) / 2;\n            build(a, v*2, tl, tm);\n            build(a, v*2+1, tm+1, tr);\n            t[v] = 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    void update(int v, int tl, int tr, int l, int r, int add) {\n        if (l > r)\n            return;\n        if (l == tl && r == tr) {\n            t[v] += add;\n        } else {\n            int tm = (tl + tr) / 2;\n            update(v*2, tl, tm, l, min(r, tm), add);\n            update(v*2+1, tm+1, tr, max(l, tm+1), r, add);\n        }\n    }\n\n    int get(int v, int tl, int tr, int pos) {\n        if (tl == tr)\n            return t[v];\n        int tm = (tl + tr) / 2;\n        if (pos <= tm)\n            return t[v] + get(v*2, tl, tm, pos);\n        else\n            return t[v] + get(v*2+1, tm+1, tr, pos);\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Sorting\n    Section: Binary search\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Binary search}\n\n    \\index{binary search}\n\n    A general method for searching for an element\n    in an array is to use a \\texttt{for} loop\n    that iterates through the elements of the array.\n    For example, the following code searches for\n    an element $x$ in an array:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        if (array[i] == x) {\n            // x found at index i\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$,\n    because in the worst case, it is necessary to check\n    all elements of the array.\n    If the order of the elements is arbitrary,\n    this is also the best possible approach, because\n    there is no additional information available where\n    in the array we should search for the element $x$.\n\n    However, if the array is \\emph{sorted},\n    the situation is different.\n    In this case it is possible to perform the\n    search much faster, because the order of the\n    elements in the array guides the search.\n    The following \\key{binary search} algorithm\n    efficiently searches for an element in a sorted array\n    in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Method 1}\n\n    The usual way to implement binary search\n    resembles looking for a word in a dictionary.\n    The search maintains an active region in the array,\n    which initially contains all array elements.\n    Then, a number of steps is performed,\n    each of which halves the size of the region.\n\n    At each step, the search checks the middle element\n    of the active region.\n    If the middle element is the target element,\n    the search terminates.\n    Otherwise, the search recursively continues\n    to the left or right half of the region,\n    depending on the value of the middle element.\n\n    The above idea can be implemented as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int a = 0, b = n-1;\n    while (a <= b) {\n        int k = (a+b)/2;\n        if (array[k] == x) {\n            // x found at index k\n        }\n        if (array[k] > x) b = k-1;\n        else a = k+1;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    In this implementation, the active region is $a \\ldots b$,\n    and initially the region is $0 \\ldots n-1$.\n    The algorithm halves the size of the region at each step,\n    so the time complexity is $O(\\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Method 2}\n\n    An alternative method to implement binary search\n    is based on an efficient way to iterate through\n    the elements of the array.\n    The idea is to make jumps and slow the speed\n    when we get closer to the target element.\n\n    The search goes through the array from left to\n    right, and the initial jump length is $n/2$.\n    At each step, the jump length will be halved:\n    first $n/4$, then $n/8$, $n/16$, etc., until\n    finally the length is 1.\n    After the jumps, either the target element has\n    been found or we know that it does not appear in the array.\n\n    The following code implements the above idea:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int k = 0;\n    for (int b = n/2; b >= 1; b /= 2) {\n        while (k+b < n && array[k+b] <= x) k += b;\n    }\n    if (array[k] == x) {\n        // x found at index k\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    During the search, the variable $b$\n    contains the current jump length.\n    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(\\log n)$,\n    because the code in the \\texttt{while} loop\n    is performed at most twice for each jump length.\n\n    \\subsubsection{C++ functions}\n\n    The C++ standard library contains the following functions\n    that are based on binary search and work in logarithmic time:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\texttt{lower\\_bound} returns a pointer to the\n    first array element whose value is at least $x$.\n    \\item \\texttt{upper\\_bound} returns a pointer to the\n    first array element whose value is larger than $x$.\n    \\item \\texttt{equal\\_range} returns both above pointers.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    The functions assume that the array is sorted.\n    If there is no such element, the pointer points to\n    the element after the last array element.\n    For example, the following code finds out whether\n    an array contains an element with value $x$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    auto k = lower_bound(array,array+n,x)-array;\n    if (k < n && array[k] == x) {\n        // x found at index k\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Then, the following code counts the number of elements\n    whose value is $x$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    auto a = lower_bound(array, array+n, x);\n    auto b = upper_bound(array, array+n, x);\n    cout << b-a << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Using \\texttt{equal\\_range}, the code becomes shorter:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    auto r = equal_range(array, array+n, x);\n    cout << r.second-r.first << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Finding the smallest solution}\n\n    An important use for binary search is\n    to find the position where the value of a \\emph{function} changes.\n    Suppose that we wish to find the smallest value $k$\n    that is a valid solution for a problem.\n    We are given a function $\\texttt{ok}(x)$\n    that returns \\texttt{true} if $x$ is a valid solution\n    and \\texttt{false} otherwise.\n    In addition, we know that $\\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \\texttt{false}\n    when $x<k$ and \\texttt{true} when $x \\ge k$.\n    The situation looks as follows:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrr}\n    $x$ & 0 & 1 & $\\cdots$ & $k-1$ & $k$ & $k+1$ & $\\cdots$ \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $\\texttt{ok}(x)$ & \\texttt{false} & \\texttt{false}\n    & $\\cdots$ & \\texttt{false} & \\texttt{true} & \\texttt{true} & $\\cdots$ \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\noindent\n    Now, the value of $k$ can be found using binary search:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int x = -1;\n    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {\n        while (!ok(x+b)) x += b;\n    }\n    int k = x+1;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The search finds the largest value of $x$ for which\n    $\\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \\texttt{false}.\n    Thus, the next value $k=x+1$\n    is the smallest possible value for which\n    $\\texttt{ok}(k)$ is \\texttt{true}.\n    The initial jump length $z$ has to be\n    large enough, for example some value\n    for which we know beforehand that $\\texttt{ok}(z)$ is \\texttt{true}.\n\n    The algorithm calls the function \\texttt{ok}\n    $O(\\log z)$ times, so the total time complexity\n    depends on the function \\texttt{ok}.\n    For example, if the function works in $O(n)$ time,\n    the total time complexity is $O(n \\log z)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Finding the maximum value}\n\n    Binary search can also be used to find\n    the maximum value for a function that is\n    first increasing and then decreasing.\n    Our task is to find a position $k$ such that\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item\n    $f(x)<f(x+1)$ when $x<k$, and\n    \\item\n    $f(x)>f(x+1)$ when $x \\ge k$.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    The idea is to use binary search\n    for finding the largest value of $x$\n    for which $f(x)<f(x+1)$.\n    This implies that $k=x+1$\n    because $f(x+1)>f(x+2)$.\n    The following code implements the search: \n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int x = -1;\n    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {\n        while (f(x+b) < f(x+b+1)) x += b;\n    }\n    int k = x+1;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Note that unlike in the ordinary binary search,\n    here it is not allowed that consecutive values\n    of the function are equal.\n    In this case it would not be possible to know\n    how to continue the search.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Binary search\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Binary search\n\n    **Binary search** is a method that allows for quicker search of something by splitting the search interval into two. Its most common application is searching values in sorted arrays, however the splitting idea is crucial in many other typical tasks.\n\n    ## Search in sorted arrays\n\n    The most typical problem that leads to the binary search is as follows. You're given a sorted array $A_0 \\leq A_1 \\leq \\dots \\leq A_{n-1}$, check if $k$ is present within the sequence. The simplest solution would be to check every element one by one and compare it with $k$ (a so-called linear search). This approach works in $O(n)$, but doesn't utilize the fact that the array is sorted.\n\n    <center>\n    <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Binary_Search_Depiction.svg\" width=\"800px\">\n    <br>\n    <i>Binary search of the value $7$ in an array</i>.\n    <br>\n    <i>The <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binary_Search_Depiction.svg\">image</a> by [AlwaysAngry](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:AlwaysAngry) is distributed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></i> license.\n    </center>\n\n    Now assume that we know two indices $L < R$ such that $A_L \\leq k \\leq A_R$. Because the array is sorted, we can deduce that $k$ either occurs among $A_L, A_{L+1}, \\dots, A_R$ or doesn't occur in the array at all. If we pick an arbitrary index $M$ such that $L < M < R$ and check whether $k$ is less or greater than $A_M$. We have two possible cases:\n\n    1. $A_L \\leq k \\leq A_M$. In this case, we reduce the problem from $[L, R]$ to $[L, M]$;\n    1. $A_M \\leq k \\leq A_R$. In this case, we reduce the problem from $[L, R]$ to $[M, R]$.\n\n    When it is impossible to pick  $M$, that is, when $R = L + 1$, we directly compare $k$ with $A_L$ and $A_R$. Otherwise we would want to pick $M$ in such manner that it reduces the active segment to a single element as quickly as possible _in the worst case_.\n\n    Since in the worst case we will always reduce to larger segment of $[L, M]$ and $[M, R]$. Thus, in the worst case scenario the reduction would be from $R-L$ to $\\max(M-L, R-M)$. To minimize this value, we should pick $M \\approx \\frac{L+R}{2}$, then\n\n    $$\n    M-L \\approx \\frac{R-L}{2} \\approx R-M.\n    $$\n\n    In other words, from the worst-case scenario perspective it is optimal to always pick $M$ in the middle of $[L, R]$ and split it in half. Thus, the active segment halves on each step until it becomes of size $1$. So, if the process needs $h$ steps, in the end it reduces the difference between $R$ and $L$ from $R-L$ to $\\frac{R-L}{2^h} \\approx 1$, giving us the equation $2^h \\approx R-L$.\n\n    Taking $\\log_2$ on both sides, we get $h \\approx \\log_2(R-L) \\in O(\\log n)$.\n\n    Logarithmic number of steps is drastically better than that of linear search. For example, for $n \\approx 2^{20} \\approx 10^6$ you'd need to make approximately a million operations for linear search, but only around $20$ operations with the binary search.\n\n    ### Lower bound and upper bound\n\n    It is often convenient to find the position of the first element that is not less than $k$ (called the lower bound of $k$ in the array) or the position of the first element that is greater than $k$ (called the upper bound of $k$) rather than the exact position of the element.\n\n    Together, lower and upper bounds produce a possibly empty half-interval of the array elements that are equal to $k$. To check whether $k$ is present in the array it's enough to find its lower bound and check if the corresponding element equates to $k$.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    The explanation above provides a rough description of the algorithm. For the implementation details, we'd need to be more precise.\n\n    We will maintain a pair $L < R$ such that $A_L \\leq k < A_R$. Meaning that the active search interval is $[L, R)$. We use half-interval here instead of a segment $[L, R]$ as it turns out to require less corner case work.\n\n    When $R = L+1$, we can deduce from definitions above that $R$ is the upper bound of $k$. It is convenient to initialize $R$ with past-the-end index, that is $R=n$ and $L$ with before-the-beginning index, that is $L=-1$. It is fine as long as we never evaluate $A_L$ and $A_R$ in our algorithm directly, formally treating it as $A_L = -\\infty$ and $A_R = +\\infty$.\n\n    Finally, to be specific about the value of $M$ we pick, we will stick with $M = \\lfloor \\frac{L+R}{2} \\rfloor$.\n\n    Then the implementation could look like this:\n\n    ```cpp\n    ... // a sorted array is stored as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]\n    int l = -1, r = n;\n    while(r - l > 1) {\n        int m = (l + r) / 2;\n        if(k < a[m]) {\n            r = m; // a[l] <= k < a[m] <= a[r]\n        } else {\n            l = m; // a[l] <= a[m] <= k < a[r]\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    During the execution of the algorithm, we never evaluate neither $A_L$ nor $A_R$, as $L < M < R$. In the end, $L$ will be the index of the last element that is not greater than $k$ (or $-1$ if there is no such element) and $R$ will be the index of the first element larger than $k$ (or $n$ if there is no such element).\n\n    ## Search on arbitrary predicate\n\n    Let $f : \\{0,1,\\dots, n-1\\} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ be a boolean function defined on $0,1,\\dots,n-1$ such that it is monotonous, that is\n\n    $$\n    f(0) \\leq f(1) \\leq \\dots \\leq f(n-1).\n    $$\n\n    The binary search, the way it is described above, finds the partition of the array by the predicate $f(M)$, holding the boolean value of $k < A_M$ expression. In other words, binary search finds the unique index $L$ such that $f(L) = 0$ and $f(R)=f(L+1)=1$.\n\n    It is possible to use arbitrary monotonous predicate instead of $k < A_M$. It is particularly useful when the computation of $f(k)$ is requires too much time to actually compute it for every possible value.\n\n    ```cpp\n    ... // f(i) is a boolean function such that f(0) <= ... <= f(n-1)\n    int l = -1, r = n;\n    while(r - l > 1) {\n        int m = (l + r) / 2;\n        if(f(m)) {\n            r = m; // 0 = f(l) < f(m) = 1\n        } else {\n            l = m; // 0 = f(m) < f(r) = 1\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value is `6`, the function should return `4`, which is the index where `6` would be inserted.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a binary search approach. Since the list is sorted, we can efficiently find the position where the new value should be inserted. We will maintain two pointers (or indices) to represent the current search range and repeatedly narrow down this range until we find the correct insertion point.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function right_insertion(arr, value):\n       set left to 0\n       set right to length of arr\n       \n       while left < right:\n           set mid to (left + right) // 2\n           if arr[mid] <= value:\n               set left to mid + 1\n           else:\n               set right to mid\n       \n       return left\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef right_insertion(arr, value):\n    # Initialize left and right pointers\n    left = 0\n    right = len(arr)\n    \n    # Perform binary search\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2  # Find the middle index\n        if arr[mid] <= value:  # If the middle element is less than or equal to the value\n            left = mid + 1  # Move the left pointer to mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid  # Move the right pointer to mid\n    \n    # The left pointer will be the correct insertion point\n    return left\n```"
