    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list and an integer `n`, splits the list into two parts at the `n`-th index, and then appends the first part to the end of the second part. The result should be a new list that starts with the elements after the `n`-th index followed by the elements before the `n`-th index.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - First, we need to identify the split point in the list, which is the `n`-th index.\n   - We will then create two sublists: one containing the elements from the start of the list up to the `n`-th index (exclusive), and the other containing the elements from the `n`-th index to the end of the list.\n   - Finally, we will concatenate the second sublist with the first sublist to form the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function split_Arr(arr, n):\n       # Get the first part of the list from index 0 to n (exclusive)\n       first_part = arr[0:n]\n       # Get the second part of the list from index n to the end\n       second_part = arr[n:]\n       # Concatenate the second part with the first part\n       result = second_part + first_part\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef split_Arr(arr, n):\n    # Get the first part of the list from index 0 to n (exclusive)\n    first_part = arr[0:n]\n    # Get the second part of the list from index n to the end\n    second_part = arr[n:]\n    # Concatenate the second part with the first part\n    result = second_part + first_part\n    return result\n```",
