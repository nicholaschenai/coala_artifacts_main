    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Coin problem
    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{Greedy algorithms}

    \index{greedy algorithm}

    A \key{greedy algorithm}
    constructs a solution to the problem
    by always making a choice that looks
    the best at the moment.
    A greedy algorithm never takes back
    its choices, but directly constructs
    the final solution.
    For this reason, greedy algorithms
    are usually very efficient.

    The difficulty in designing greedy algorithms
    is to find a greedy strategy
    that always produces an optimal solution
    to the problem.
    The locally optimal choices in a greedy
    algorithm should also be globally optimal.
    It is often difficult to argue that
    a greedy algorithm works.

    \section{Coin problem}

    As a first example, we consider a problem
    where we are given a set of coins
    and our task is to form a sum of money $n$
    using the coins.
    The values of the coins are
    $\texttt{coins}=\{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k\}$,
    and each coin can be used as many times we want.
    What is the minimum number of coins needed?

    For example, if the coins are the euro coins (in cents)
    \[\{1,2,5,10,20,50,100,200\}\]
    and $n=520$,
    we need at least four coins.
    The optimal solution is to select coins
    $200+200+100+20$ whose sum is 520.

    \subsubsection{Greedy algorithm}

    A simple greedy algorithm to the problem
    always selects the largest possible coin,
    until the required sum of money has been constructed.
    This algorithm works in the example case,
    because we first select two 200 cent coins,
    then one 100 cent coin and finally one 20 cent coin.
    But does this algorithm always work?

    It turns out that if the coins are the euro coins,
    the greedy algorithm \emph{always} works, i.e.,
    it always produces a solution with the fewest
    possible number of coins.
    The correctness of the algorithm can be
    shown as follows:

    First, each coin 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 appears
    at most once in an optimal solution,
    because if the
    solution would contain two such coins,
    we could replace them by one coin and
    obtain a better solution.
    For example, if the solution would contain
    coins $5+5$, we could replace them by coin $10$.

    In the same way, coins 2 and 20 appear
    at most twice in an optimal solution,
    because we could replace
    coins $2+2+2$ by coins $5+1$ and
    coins $20+20+20$ by coins $50+10$.
    Moreover, an optimal solution cannot contain
    coins $2+2+1$ or $20+20+10$,
    because we could replace them by coins $5$ and $50$.

    Using these observations,
    we can show for each coin $x$ that
    it is not possible to optimally construct
    a sum $x$ or any larger sum by only using coins
    that are smaller than $x$.
    For example, if $x=100$, the largest optimal
    sum using the smaller coins is  $50+20+20+5+2+2=99$.
    Thus, the greedy algorithm that always selects
    the largest coin produces the optimal solution.

    This example shows that it can be difficult
    to argue that a greedy algorithm works,
    even if the algorithm itself is simple.

    \subsubsection{General case}

    In the general case, the coin set can contain any coins
    and the greedy algorithm \emph{does not} necessarily produce
    an optimal solution.

    We can prove that a greedy algorithm does not work
    by showing a counterexample
    where the algorithm gives a wrong answer.
    In this problem we can easily find a counterexample:
    if the coins are $\{1,3,4\}$ and the target sum
    is 6, the greedy algorithm produces the solution
    $4+1+1$ while the optimal solution is $3+3$.

    It is not known if the general coin problem
    can be solved using any greedy algorithm\footnote{However, it is possible
    to \emph{check} in polynomial time
    if the greedy algorithm presented in this chapter works for
    a given set of coins \cite{pea05}.}.
    However, as we will see in Chapter 7,
    in some cases,
    the general problem can be efficiently
    solved using a dynamic
    programming algorithm that always gives the
    correct answer.

    Chapter: Dynamic programming
    Section: Coin problem
    Part: 2/2
    $:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    value[0] = 0;
    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        value[x] = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            if (x-c >= 0) {
                value[x] = min(value[x], value[x-c]+1);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    In fact, most competitive programmers prefer this
    implementation, because it is shorter and has
    lower constant factors.
    From now on, we also use iterative implementations
    in our examples.
    Still, it is often easier to think about
    dynamic programming solutions
    in terms of recursive functions.


    \subsubsection{Constructing a solution}

    Sometimes we are asked both to find the value
    of an optimal solution and to give
    an example how such a solution can be constructed.
    In the coin problem, for example,
    we can declare another array
    that indicates for
    each sum of money the first coin 
    in an optimal solution:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int first[N];
    \end{lstlisting}
    Then, we can modify the algorithm as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    value[0] = 0;
    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        value[x] = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            if (x-c >= 0 && value[x-c]+1 < value[x]) {
                value[x] = value[x-c]+1;
                first[x] = c;
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this, the following code can be used to
    print the coins that appear in an optimal solution for
    the sum $n$:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    while (n > 0) {
        cout << first[n] << "\n";
        n -= first[n];
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Counting the number of solutions}

    Let us now consider another version
    of the coin problem where our task is to
    calculate the total number of ways
    to produce a sum $x$ using the coins.
    For example, if $\texttt{coins}=\{1,3,4\}$ and
    $x=5$, there are a total of 6 ways:

    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1+1+1+1+1$
    \item $1+1+3$
    \item $1+3+1$
    \item $3+1+1$
    \item $1+4$
    \item $4+1$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}

    Again, we can solve the problem recursively.
    Let $\texttt{solve}(x)$ denote the number of ways
    we can form the sum $x$.
    For example, if $\texttt{coins}=\{1,3,4\}$,
    then $\texttt{solve}(5)=6$ and the recursive formula is
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \texttt{solve}(x) = & \texttt{solve}(x-1) + \\
                        & \texttt{solve}(x-3) + \\
                        & \texttt{solve}(x-4)  .
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    Then, the general recursive function is as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{solve}(x) = \begin{cases}
                   0               & x < 0\\
                   1               & x = 0\\
                   \sum_{c \in \texttt{coins}} \texttt{solve}(x-c) & x > 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    If $x<0$, the value is 0, because there are no solutions.
    If $x=0$, the value is 1, because there is only one way
    to form an empty sum.
    Otherwise we calculate the sum of all values
    of the form $\texttt{solve}(x-c)$ where $c$ is in \texttt{coins}.

    The following code constructs an array
    $\texttt{count}$ such that
    $\texttt{count}[x]$ equals
    the value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    for $0 \le x \le n$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    count[0] = 1;
    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        for (auto c : coins) {
            if (x-c >= 0) {
                count[x] += count[x-c];
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Often the number of solutions is so large
    that it is not required to calculate the exact number
    but it is enough to give the answer modulo $m$
    where, for example, $m=10^9+7$.
    This can be done by changing the code so that
    all calculations are done modulo $m$.
    In the above code, it suffices to add the line
    \begin{lstlisting}
            count[x] %= m;
    \end{lstlisting}
    after the line
    \begin{lstlisting}
            count[x] += count[x-c];
    \end{lstlisting}

    Now we have discussed all basic
    ideas of dynamic programming.
    Since dynamic programming can be used
    in many different situations,
    we will now go through a set of problems
    that show further examples about the
    possibilities of dynamic programming.

    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Scheduling
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Scheduling}

    Many scheduling problems can be solved
    using greedy algorithms.
    A classic problem is as follows:
    Given $n$ events with their starting and ending
    times, find a schedule
    that includes as many events as possible.
    It is not possible to select an event partially.
    For example, consider the following events:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
    event & starting time & ending time \\
    \hline
    $A$ & 1 & 3 \\
    $B$ & 2 & 5 \\
    $C$ & 3 & 9 \\
    $D$ & 6 & 8 \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    In this case the maximum number of events is two.
    For example, we can select events $B$ and $D$
    as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]
      \begin{scope}
        \draw (2, 0) rectangle (6, -1);
        \draw[fill=lightgray] (4, -1.5) rectangle (10, -2.5);
        \draw (6, -3) rectangle (18, -4);
        \draw[fill=lightgray] (12, -4.5) rectangle (16, -5.5);
        \node at (2.5,-0.5) {$A$};
        \node at (4.5,-2) {$B$};
        \node at (6.5,-3.5) {$C$};
        \node at (12.5,-5) {$D$};
      \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    It is possible to invent several greedy algorithms
    for the problem, but which of them works in every case?

    \subsubsection*{Algorithm 1}

    The first idea is to select as \emph{short}
    events as possible.
    In the example case this algorithm
    selects the following events:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]
      \begin{scope}
        \draw[fill=lightgray] (2, 0) rectangle (6, -1);
        \draw (4, -1.5) rectangle (10, -2.5);
        \draw (6, -3) rectangle (18, -4);
        \draw[fill=lightgray] (12, -4.5) rectangle (16, -5.5);
        \node at (2.5,-0.5) {$A$};
        \node at (4.5,-2) {$B$};
        \node at (6.5,-3.5) {$C$};
        \node at (12.5,-5) {$D$};
      \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    However, selecting short events is not always
    a correct strategy. For example, the algorithm fails
    in the following case:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]
      \begin{scope}
        \draw (1, 0) rectangle (7, -1);
        \draw[fill=lightgray] (6, -1.5) rectangle (9, -2.5);
        \draw (8, -3) rectangle (14, -4);
      \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    If we select the short event, we can only select one event.
    However, it would be possible to select both long events.

    \subsubsection*{Algorithm 2}

    Another idea is to always select the next possible
    event that \emph{begins} as \emph{early} as possible.
    This algorithm selects the following events:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]
      \begin{scope}
        \draw[fill=lightgray] (2, 0) rectangle (6, -1);
        \draw (4, -1.5) rectangle (10, -2.5);
        \draw[fill=lightgray] (6, -3) rectangle (18, -4);
        \draw (12, -4.5) rectangle (16, -5.5);
        \node at (2.5,-0.5) {$A$};
        \node at (4.5,-2) {$B$};
        \node at (6.5,-3.5) {$C$};
        \node at (12.5,-5) {$D$};
      \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    However, we can find a counterexample
    also for this algorithm.
    For example, in the following case,
    the algorithm only selects one event:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]
      \begin{scope}
        \draw[fill=lightgray] (1, 0) rectangle (14, -1);
        \draw (3, -1.5) rectangle (7, -2.5);
        \draw (8, -3) rectangle (12, -4);
      \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    If we select the first event, it is not possible
    to select any other events.
    However, it would be possible to select the
    other two events.

    \subsubsection*{Algorithm 3}

    The third idea is to always select the next
    possible event that \emph{ends} as \emph{early} as possible.
    This algorithm selects the following events: 
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]
      \begin{scope}
        \draw[fill=lightgray] (2, 0) rectangle (6, -1);
        \draw (4, -1.5) rectangle (10, -2.5);
        \draw (6, -3) rectangle (18, -4);
        \draw[fill=lightgray] (12, -4.5) rectangle (16, -5.5);
        \node at (2.5,-0.5) {$A$};
        \node at (4.5,-2) {$B$};
        \node at (6.5,-3.5) {$C$};
        \node at (12.5,-5) {$D$};
      \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    It turns out that this algorithm
    \emph{always} produces an optimal solution.
    The reason for this is that it is always an optimal choice
    to first select an event that ends
    as early as possible.
    After this, it is an optimal choice
    to select the next event
    using the same strategy, etc.,
    until we cannot select any more events.

    One way to argue that the algorithm works
    is to consider
    what happens if we first select an event
    that ends later than the event that ends
    as early as possible.
    Now, we will have at most an equal number of
    choices how we can select the next event.
    Hence, selecting an event that ends later
    can never yield a better solution,

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/585 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of items, each represented as a dictionary with a name and a price, and returns the top `n` most expensive items from that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the most expensive items, we can sort the list of items based on their price in descending order. After sorting, we can simply take the first `n` items from this sorted list to get the most expensive ones.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function expensive_items(items, n):
       sort items by price in descending order
       return the first n items from the sorted list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def expensive_items(items, n):
    # Sort the items based on the price in descending order
    sorted_items = sorted(items, key=lambda x: x['price'], reverse=True)
    # Return the first n items from the sorted list
    return sorted_items[:n]
```
