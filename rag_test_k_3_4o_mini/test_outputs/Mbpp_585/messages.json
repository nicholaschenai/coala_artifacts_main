x <= n; x++) {\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            if (x-c >= 0) {\n                count[x] += count[x-c];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Often the number of solutions is so large\n    that it is not required to calculate the exact number\n    but it is enough to give the answer modulo $m$\n    where, for example, $m=10^9+7$.\n    This can be done by changing the code so that\n    all calculations are done modulo $m$.\n    In the above code, it suffices to add the line\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n            count[x] %= m;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    after the line\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n            count[x] += count[x-c];\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Now we have discussed all basic\n    ideas of dynamic programming.\n    Since dynamic programming can be used\n    in many different situations,\n    we will now go through a set of problems\n    that show further examples about the\n    possibilities of dynamic programming.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Greedy algorithms\n    Section: Scheduling\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Scheduling}\n\n    Many scheduling problems can be solved\n    using greedy algorithms.\n    A classic problem is as follows:\n    Given $n$ events with their starting and ending\n    times, find a schedule\n    that includes as many events as possible.\n    It is not possible to select an event partially.\n    For example, consider the following events:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{lll}\n    event & starting time & ending time \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $A$ & 1 & 3 \\\\\n    $B$ & 2 & 5 \\\\\n    $C$ & 3 & 9 \\\\\n    $D$ & 6 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n    In this case the maximum number of events is two.\n    For example, we can select events $B$ and $D$\n    as follows:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\draw (2, 0) rectangle (6, -1);\n        \\draw[fill=lightgray] (4, -1.5) rectangle (10, -2.5);\n        \\draw (6, -3) rectangle (18, -4);\n        \\draw[fill=lightgray] (12, -4.5) rectangle (16, -5.5);\n        \\node at (2.5,-0.5) {$A$};\n        \\node at (4.5,-2) {$B$};\n        \\node at (6.5,-3.5) {$C$};\n        \\node at (12.5,-5) {$D$};\n      \\end{scope}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    It is possible to invent several greedy algorithms\n    for the problem, but which of them works in every case?\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Algorithm 1}\n\n    The first idea is to select as \\emph{short}\n    events as possible.\n    In the example case this algorithm\n    selects the following events:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\draw[fill=lightgray] (2, 0) rectangle (6, -1);\n        \\draw (4, -1.5) rectangle (10, -2.5);\n        \\draw (6, -3) rectangle (18, -4);\n        \\draw[fill=lightgray] (12, -4.5) rectangle (16, -5.5);\n        \\node at (2.5,-0.5) {$A$};\n        \\node at (4.5,-2) {$B$};\n        \\node at (6.5,-3.5) {$C$};\n        \\node at (12.5,-5) {$D$};\n      \\end{scope}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    However, selecting short events is not always\n    a correct strategy. For example, the algorithm fails\n    in the following case:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\draw (1, 0) rectangle (7, -1);\n        \\draw[fill=lightgray] (6, -1.5) rectangle (9, -2.5);\n        \\draw (8, -3) rectangle (14, -4);\n      \\end{scope}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    If we select the short event, we can only select one event.\n    However, it would be possible to select both long events.\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Algorithm 2}\n\n    Another idea is to always select the next possible\n    event that \\emph{begins} as \\emph{early} as possible.\n    This algorithm selects the following events:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\draw[fill=lightgray] (2, 0) rectangle (6, -1);\n        \\draw (4, -1.5) rectangle (10, -2.5);\n        \\draw[fill=lightgray] (6, -3) rectangle (18, -4);\n        \\draw (12, -4.5) rectangle (16, -5.5);\n        \\node at (2.5,-0.5) {$A$};\n        \\node at (4.5,-2) {$B$};\n        \\node at (6.5,-3.5) {$C$};\n        \\node at (12.5,-5) {$D$};\n      \\end{scope}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    However, we can find a counterexample\n    also for this algorithm.\n    For example, in the following case,\n    the algorithm only selects one event:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\draw[fill=lightgray] (1, 0) rectangle (14, -1);\n        \\draw (3, -1.5) rectangle (7, -2.5);\n        \\draw (8, -3) rectangle (12, -4);\n      \\end{scope}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    If we select the first event, it is not possible\n    to select any other events.\n    However, it would be possible to select the\n    other two events.\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Algorithm 3}\n\n    The third idea is to always select the next\n    possible event that \\emph{ends} as \\emph{early} as possible.\n    This algorithm selects the following events: \n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\draw[fill=lightgray] (2, 0) rectangle (6, -1);\n        \\draw (4, -1.5) rectangle (10, -2.5);\n        \\draw (6, -3) rectangle (18, -4);\n        \\draw[fill=lightgray] (12, -4.5) rectangle (16, -5.5);\n        \\node at (2.5,-0.5) {$A$};\n        \\node at (4.5,-2) {$B$};\n        \\node at (6.5,-3.5) {$C$};\n        \\node at (12.5,-5) {$D$};\n      \\end{scope}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    It turns out that this algorithm\n    \\emph{always} produces an optimal solution.\n    The reason for this is that it is always an optimal choice\n    to first select an event that ends\n    as early as possible.\n    After this, it is an optimal choice\n    to select the next event\n    using the same strategy, etc.,\n    until we cannot select any more events.\n\n    One way to argue that the algorithm works\n    is to consider\n    what happens if we first select an event\n    that ends later than the event that ends\n    as early as possible.\n    Now, we will have at most an equal number of\n    choices how we can select the next event.\n    Hence, selecting an event that ends later\n    can never yield a better solution,\n    and the greedy algorithm is correct.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
