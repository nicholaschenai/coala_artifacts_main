A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares because they are 1\u00b2, 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2, and 4\u00b2 respectively.

2$, and check if the equation holds or not.\n    If it doesn't hold, e.g. $a^{p-1} \\not\\equiv 1 \\bmod p$, we know that $p$ cannot be a prime number.\n    In this case we call the base $a$ a *Fermat witness* for the compositeness of $p$.\n\n    However it is also possible, that the equation holds for a composite number.\n    So if the equation holds, we don't have a proof for primality.\n    We only can say that $p$ is *probably prime*.\n    If it turns out that the number is actually composite, we call the base $a$ a *Fermat liar*.\n\n    By running the test for all possible bases $a$, we can actually prove that a number is prime.\n    However this is not done in practice, since this is a lot more effort that just doing *trial division*.\n    Instead the test will be repeated multiple times with random choices for $a$.\n    If we find no witness for the compositeness, it is very likely that the number is in fact prime.\n\n    ```cpp\n    bool probablyPrimeFermat(int n, int iter=5) {\n        if (n < 4)\n            return n == 2 || n == 3;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {\n            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);\n            if (binpower(a, n - 1, n) != 1)\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We use [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md) to efficiently compute the power $a^{p-1}$.\n\n    There is one bad news though:\n    there exist some composite numbers where $a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\bmod n$ holds for all $a$ coprime to $n$, for instance for the number $561 = 3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17$.\n    Such numbers are called *Carmichael numbers*.\n    The Fermat primality test can identify these numbers only, if we have immense luck and choose a base $a$ with $\\gcd(a, n) \\ne 1$.\n\n    The Fermat test is still be used in practice, as it is very fast and Carmichael numbers are very rare.\n    E.g. there only exist 646 such numbers below $10^9$.\n\n    ## Miller-Rabin primality test\n\n    The Miller-Rabin test extends the ideas from the Fermat test.\n\n    For an odd number $n$, $n-1$ is even and we can factor out all powers of 2.\n    We can write:\n\n    $$n - 1 = 2^s \\cdot d,~\\text{with}~d~\\text{odd}.$$\n\n    This allows us to factorize the equation of Fermat's little theorem:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{rl}\n    a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\bmod n &\\Longleftrightarrow a^{2^s d} - 1 \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    &\\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-1} d} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    &\\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    &\\quad\\vdots \\\\\\\\\n    &\\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) \\cdots (a^{d} + 1) (a^{d} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    If $n$ is prime, then $n$ has to divide one of these factors.\n    And in the Miller-Rabin primality test we check exactly that statement, which is a more stricter version of the statement of the Fermat test.\n    For a base $2 \\le a \\le n-2$ we check if either\n\n    $$a^d \\equiv 1 \\bmod n$$\n\n    holds or\n\n    $$a^{2^r d} \\equiv -1 \\bmod n$$\n\n    holds for some $0 \\le r \\le s - 1$.\n\n    If we found a base $a$ which doesn't satisfy any of the above equalities, than we found a *witness* for the compositeness of $n$.\n    In this case we have proven that $n$ is not a prime number.\n\n    Similar to the Fermat test, it is also possible that the set of equations is satisfied for a composite number.\n    In that case the base $a$ is called a *strong liar*.\n    If a base $a$ satisfies the equations (one of them), $n$ is only *strong probable prime*.\n    However, there are no numbers like the Carmichael numbers, where all non-trivial bases lie.\n    In fact it is possible to show, that at most $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the bases can be strong liars.\n    If $n$ is composite, we have a probability of $\\ge 75\\%$ that a random base will tell us that it is composite.\n    By doing multiple iterations, choosing different random bases, we can tell with very high probability if the number is truly prime or if it is composite.\n\n    Here is an implementation for 64 bit integer.\n\n    ```cpp\n    using u64 = uint64_t;\n    using u128 = __uint128_t;\n\n    u64 binpower(u64 base, u64 e, u64 mod) {\n        u64 result = 1;\n        base %= mod;\n        while (e) {\n            if (e & 1)\n                result = (u128)result * base % mod;\n            base = (u128)base * base % mod;\n            e >>= 1;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    bool check_composite(u64 n, u64 a, u64 d, int s) {\n        u64 x = binpower(a, d, n);\n        if (x == 1 || x == n - 1)\n            return false;\n        for (int r = 1; r < s; r++) {\n            x = (u128)x * x % n;\n            if (x == n - 1)\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    };\n\n    bool MillerRabin(u64 n, int iter=5) { // returns true if n is probably prime, else returns false.\n        if (n < 4)\n            return n == 2 || n == 3;\n\n        int s = 0;\n        u64 d = n - 1;\n        while ((d & 1) == 0) {\n            d >>= 1;\n            s++;\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {\n            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);\n            if (check_composite(n, a, d, s))\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Before the Miller-Rabin test you can test additionally if one of the first few prime numbers is a divisor.\n    This can speed up the test by a lot, since most composite numbers have very small prime divisors.\n    E.g. $88\\%$ of all numbers have a prime factors smaller than $100$.\n\n    ### Deterministic version\n\n    Miller showed that it is possible to make the algorithm deterministic by only checking all bases $\\le O((\\ln n)^2)$.\n    Bach later gave a concrete bound, it is only necessary to test all bases $a \\le 2 \\ln(n)^2$.\n\n    This is still a pretty large number of bases.\n    So people have invested quite a lot of computation power into finding lower bounds.\n    It turns out, for testing a 32 bit integer it is only necessary to check the first 4 prime bases: 2, 3, 5 and 7.\n    The smallest composite number that fails this test is $3,215,031,751 = 151 \\cdot 751 \\cdot 28351$.\n    And for testing 64 bit integer it is enough to check the first 12 prime bases: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.\n\n    This results in the following deterministic implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    bool MillerRabin(u64 n) { // returns true if n is prime, else returns false.\n        if (n < 2)\n            return false;\n\n        int r = 0;\n        u64 d = n - 1;\n        while ((d & 1) == 0) {\n            d >>= 1;\n            r++;\n        }\n\n        for (int a : {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37}) {\n            if (n == a)\n                return true;\n            if (check_composite(n, a, d, r))\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Continued fractions\n    Part: 7/12\n    === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # compute the continued fraction of sqrt(n)\n            def sqrt(n):\n                n0 = math.floor(math.sqrt(n))\n                x, y, z = 1, 0, 1\n                a = []\n                def step(x, y, z):\n                    a.append((x * n0 + y) // z)\n                    t = y -

For example, $\\pi(10)=4$, because\n    there are 4 primes between $1$ and $10$: 2, 3, 5 and 7.\n\n    It is possible to show that\n    \\[\\pi(n) \\approx \\frac{n}{\\ln n},\\]\n    which means that primes are quite frequent.\n    For example, the number of primes between\n    $1$ and $10^6$ is $\\pi(10^6)=78498$,\n    and $10^6 / \\ln 10^6 \\approx 72382$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Conjectures}\n\n    There are many \\emph{conjectures} involving primes.\n    Most people think that the conjectures are true,\n    but nobody has been able to prove them.\n    For example, the following conjectures are famous:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\index{Goldbach's conjecture}\n    \\item \\key{Goldbach's conjecture}:\n    Each even integer $n>2$ can be represented as a\n    sum $n=a+b$ so that both $a$ and $b$ are primes.\n    \\index{twin prime}\n    \\item \\key{Twin prime conjecture}:\n    There is an infinite number of pairs\n    of the form $\\{p,p+2\\}$,\n    where both $p$ and $p+2$ are primes.\n    \\index{Legendre's conjecture}\n    \\item \\key{Legendre's conjecture}:\n    There is always a prime between numbers\n    $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$, where $n$ is any positive integer.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Basic algorithms}\n\n    If a number $n$ is not prime,\n    it can be represented as a product $a \\cdot b$,\n    where $a \\le \\sqrt n$ or $b \\le \\sqrt n$,\n    so it certainly has a factor between $2$ and $\\lfloor \\sqrt n \\rfloor$.\n    Using this observation, we can both test\n    if a number is prime and find the prime factorization\n    of a number in $O(\\sqrt n)$ time.\n\n    The following function \\texttt{prime} checks\n    if the given number $n$ is prime.\n    The function attempts to divide $n$ by\n    all numbers between $2$ and $\\lfloor \\sqrt n \\rfloor$,\n    and if none of them divides $n$, then $n$ is prime.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    bool prime(int n) {\n        if (n < 2) return false;\n        for (int x = 2;

x*x <= n; x++) {\n            while (n%x == 0) {\n                f.push_back(x);\n                n /= x;\n            }\n        }\n        if (n > 1) f.push_back(n);\n        return f;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Note that each prime factor appears in the vector\n    as many times as it divides the number.\n    For example, $24=2^3 \\cdot 3$,\n    so the result of the function is $[2,2,2,3]$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Sieve of Eratosthenes}\n\n    \\index{sieve of Eratosthenes}\n\n    The \\key{sieve of Eratosthenes}\n    %\\footnote{Eratosthenes (c. 276 BC -- c. 194 BC) was a Greek mathematician.}\n    is a preprocessing\n    algorithm that builds an array using which we\n    can efficiently check if a given number between $2 \\ldots n$\n    is prime and, if it is not, find one prime factor of the number.\n\n    The algorithm builds an array $\\texttt{sieve}$\n    whose positions $2,3,\\ldots,n$ are used.\n    The value $\\texttt{sieve}[k]=0$ means\n    that $k$ is prime,\n    and the value $\\texttt{sieve}[k] \\neq 0$\n    means that $k$ is not a prime and one\n    of its prime factors is $\\texttt{sieve}[k]$.\n\n    The algorithm iterates through the numbers\n    $2 \\ldots n$ one by one.\n    Always when a new prime $x$ is found,\n    the algorithm records that the multiples\n    of $x$ ($2x,3x,4x,\\ldots$) are not primes,\n    because the number $x$ divides them.\n\n    For example, if $n=20$, the array is as follows:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (19,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (8.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (9.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (10.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (11.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (12.5,0.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (13.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (14.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (15.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (16.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (17.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (18.5,0.5) {$5$};\n\n    \\footnotesize\n\n    \\node at (0.5,1.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (1.5,1.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,1.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (3.5,1.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (4.5,1.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (5.5,1.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (6.5,1.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (7.5,1.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (8.5,1.5) {$10$};\n    \\node at (9.5,1.5) {$11$};\n    \\node at (10.5,1.5) {$12$};\n    \\node at (11.5,1.5) {$13$};\n    \\node at (12.5,1.5) {$14\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: We need to create a function that checks if a given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares (1=1^2, 2=2^2, 3=3^2, 4=4^2), while 2, 3, 5, and 10 are not.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To determine if a number is a perfect square, we can take the integer square root of the number and then square it again. If the result matches the original number, then it is a perfect square. If not, it is not a perfect square.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_perfect_square(n):\n       if n < 0:\n           return False\n       sqrt_n = integer square root of n\n       return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is negative, as negative numbers cannot be perfect squares\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Calculate the integer square root of n\n    sqrt_n = int(n ** 0.5)\n    \n    # Check if squaring the integer square root gives back the original number\n    return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n\n```"
