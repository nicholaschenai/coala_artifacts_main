INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/803 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that determines if a given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares because they are 1Â², 2Â², 3Â², and 4Â² respectively. The function should return `True` if the number is a perfect square and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To check if a number is a perfect square, we can take the integer square root of the number and then square that result. If squaring the integer square root gives us back the original number, then it is a perfect square. If not, it is not a perfect square.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `is_perfect_square` that takes an integer `n`.
   - If `n` is less than 0, return `False` (since negative numbers cannot be perfect squares).
   - Calculate the integer square root of `n` (let's call it `root`).
   - If `root * root` equals `n`, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the number is negative
    if n < 0:
        return False
    
    # Calculate the integer square root
    root = int(n**0.5)
    
    # Check if squaring the root gives the original number
    return root * root == n

    Title: Primality tests
    Part: 1/2
    # Primality tests

    This article describes multiple algorithms to determine if a number is prime or not.

    ## Trial division

    By definition a prime number doesn't have any divisors other than $1$ and itself.
    A composite number has at least one additional divisor, let's call it $d$.
    Naturally $\frac{n}{d}$ is also a divisor of $n$.
    It's easy to see, that either $d \le \sqrt{n}$ or $\frac{n}{d} \le \sqrt{n}$, therefore one of the divisors $d$ and $\frac{n}{d}$ is $\le \sqrt{n}$.
    We can use this information to check for primality.

    We try to find a non-trivial divisor, by checking if any of the numbers between $2$ and $\sqrt{n}$ is a divisor of $n$.
    If it is a divisor, than $n$ is definitely not prime, otherwise it is.

    ```cpp
    bool isPrime(int x) {
        for (int d = 2; d * d <= x; d++) {
            if (x % d == 0)
                return false;
        }
        return x >= 2;
    }
    ```

    This is the simplest form of a prime check.
    You can optimize this function quite a bit, for instance by only checking all odd numbers in the loop, since the only even prime number is 2.
    Multiple such optimizations are described in the article about [integer factorization](factorization.md).

    ## Fermat primality test

    This is a probabilistic test.

    Fermat's little theorem (see also [Euler's totient function](phi-function.md)) states, that for a prime number $p$ and a coprime integer $a$ the following equation holds:

    $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \bmod p$$

    In general this theorem doesn't hold for composite numbers.

    This can be used to create a primality test.
    We pick an integer $2 \le a \le p - 2$, and check if the equation holds or not.
    If it doesn't hold, e.g. $a^{p-1} \not\equiv 1 \bmod p$, we know that $p$ cannot be a prime number.
    In this case we call the base $a$ a *Fermat witness* for the compositeness of $p$.

    However it is also possible, that the equation holds for a composite number.
    So if the equation holds, we don't have a proof for primality.
    We only can say that $p$ is *probably prime*.
    If it turns out that the number is actually composite, we call the base $a$ a *Fermat liar*.

    By running the test for all possible bases $a$, we can actually prove that a number is prime.
    However this is not done in practice, since this is a lot more effort that just doing *trial division*.
    Instead the test will be repeated multiple times with random choices for $a$.
    If we find no witness for the compositeness, it is very likely that the number is in fact prime.

    ```cpp
    bool probablyPrimeFermat(int n, int iter=5) {
        if (n < 4)
            return n == 2 || n == 3;

        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {
            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);
            if (binpower(a, n - 1, n) != 1)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    ```

    We use [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md) to efficiently compute the power $a^{p-1}$.

    There is one bad news though:
    there exist some composite numbers where $a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \bmod n$ holds for all $a$ coprime to $n$, for instance for the number $561 = 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17$.
    Such numbers are called *Carmichael numbers*.
    The Fermat primality test can identify these numbers only, if we have immense luck and choose a base $a$ with $\gcd(a, n) \ne 1$.

    The Fermat test is still be used in practice, as it is very fast and Carmichael numbers are very rare.
    E.g. there only exist 646 such numbers below $10^9$.

    ## Miller-Rabin primality test

    The Miller-Rabin test extends the ideas from the Fermat test.

    For an odd number $n$, $n-1$ is even and we can factor out all powers of 2.
    We can write:

    $$n - 1 = 2^s \cdot d,~\text{with}~d~\text{odd}.$$

    This allows us to factorize the equation of Fermat's little theorem:

    $$\begin{array}{rl}
    a^{n-1} \equiv 1 \bmod n &\Longleftrightarrow a^{2^s d} - 1 \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-1} d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    &\quad\vdots \\\\
    &\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) \cdots (a^{d} + 1) (a^{d} - 1) \equiv 0 \bmod n \\\\
    \end{array}$$

    If $n$ is prime, then $n$ has to divide one of these factors.
    And in the Miller-Rabin primality test we check exactly that statement, which is a more stricter version of the statement of the Fermat test.
    For a base $2 \le a \le n-2$ we check if either

    $$a^d \equiv 1 \bmod n$$

    holds or

    $$a^{2^r d} \equiv -1 \bmod n$$

    holds for some $0 \le r \le s - 1$.

    If we found a base $a$ which doesn't satisfy any of the above equalities, than we found a *witness* for the compositeness of $n$.
    In this case we have proven that $n$ is not a prime number.

    Similar to the Fermat test, it is also possible that the set of equations is satisfied for a composite number.
    In that case the base $a$ is called a *strong liar*.
    If a base $a$ satisfies the equations (one of them), $n$ is only *strong probable prime*.
    However, there are no numbers like the Carmichael numbers, where all non-trivial bases lie.
    In fact it is possible to show, that at most $\frac{1}{4}$ of the bases can be strong liars.
    If $n$ is composite, we have a probability of $\ge 75\%$ that a random base will tell us that it is composite.
    By doing multiple iterations, choosing different random bases, we can tell with very high probability if the number is truly prime or if it is composite.

    Here is an implementation for 64 bit integer.

    ```cpp
    using u64 = uint64_t;
    using u128 = __uint128_t;

    u64 binpower(u64 base, u64 e, u64 mod) {
        u64 result = 1;
        base %= mod;
        while (e) {
            if (e & 1)
                result = (u128)result * base % mod;
            base = (u128)base * base % mod;
            e >>= 1;
        }
        return result;
    }

    bool check_composite(u64 n, u64 a, u64 d, int s) {
        u64 x = binpower(a, d, n);
        if (x == 1 || x == n - 1)
            return false;
        for (int r = 1; r < s; r++) {
            x = (u128)x * x % n;
            if (x == n - 1)
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    };

    bool MillerRabin(u64 n, int iter=5) { // returns true if n is probably prime, else returns false.
        if (n < 4)
            return n == 2 || n == 3;

        int s = 0;
        u64 d = n - 1;
        while ((d & 1) == 0) {
            d >>= 1;
            s++;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {
            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);
            if (check_composite(n, a, d, s))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    ```

    Before the Miller-Rabin test you can test additionally if one of the first few prime numbers is a divisor.
    This can speed up the test by a lot, since most composite numbers have very small prime divisors.
    E.g. $88\%$ of all numbers have a prime factors smaller than $100$.

    ### Deterministic version

    Miller showed that it is possible to make the algorithm deterministic by only checking all bases $\le O((\ln n)^2)$.
    Bach later gave a concrete bound, it is only necessary to test all bases $a \le 2 \ln(n)^2$.

    This is still a pretty large number of bases.
    So people have invested quite a lot of computation power into finding lower bounds.
    It turns out, for testing a 32 bit integer it is only necessary to check the first 4 prime bases: 2, 3, 5 and 7.
    The smallest composite number that fails this test is $3,215,031,751 = 151 \cdot 751 \cdot 28351$.
    And for testing 64 bit integer it is enough to check the first 12 prime bases: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.

    This results in the following deterministic implementation:

    ```cpp
    bool MillerRabin(u64 n) { // returns true if n is prime, else returns false.
        if (n < 2)
            return false;

        int r = 0;
        u64 d = n - 1;
        while ((d & 1) == 0) {
            d >>= 1;
            r++;
        }

        for (int a : {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37}) {
            if (n == a)
                return true;
            if (check_composite(n, a, d, r))
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    \chapter{Number theory}

    \index{number theory}

    \key{Number theory} is a branch of mathematics
    that studies integers.
    Number theory is a fascinating field,
    because many questions involving integers
    are very difficult to solve even if they
    seem simple at first glance.

    As an example, consider the following equation:
    \[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 33\]
    It is easy to find three real numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$
    that satisfy the equation.
    For example, we can choose
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    x = 3, \\
    y = \sqrt[3]{3}, \\
    z = \sqrt[3]{3}.\\
    \end{array}
    \]
    However, it is an open problem in number theory
    if there are any three
    \emph{integers} $x$, $y$ and $z$
    that would satisfy the equation \cite{bec07}.

    In this chapter, we will focus on basic concepts
    and algorithms in number theory.
    Throughout the chapter, we will assume that all numbers
    are integers, if not otherwise stated.

    \section{Primes and factors}

    \index{divisibility}
    \index{factor}
    \index{divisor}

    A number $a$ is called a \key{factor} or a \key{divisor} of a number $b$
    if $a$ divides $b$.
    If $a$ is a factor of $b$,
    we write $a \mid b$, and otherwise we write $a \nmid b$.
    For example, the factors of 24 are
    1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24.

    \index{prime}
    \index{prime decomposition}

    A number $n>1$ is a \key{prime}
    if its only positive factors are 1 and $n$.
    For example, 7, 19 and 41 are primes,
    but 35 is not a prime, because $5 \cdot 7 = 35$.
    For every number $n>1$, there is a unique
    \key{prime factorization}
    \[ n = p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots p_k^{\alpha_k},\]
    where $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_k$ are distinct primes and
    $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_k$ are positive numbers.
    For example, the prime factorization for 84 is
    \[84 = 2^2 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 7^1.\]

    The \key{number of factors} of a number $n$ is
    \[\tau(n)=\prod_{i=1}^k (\alpha_i+1),\]
    because for each prime $p_i$, there are
    $\alpha_i+1$ ways to choose how many times
    it appears in the factor.
    For example, the number of factors
    of 84 is
    $\tau(84)=3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 12$.
    The factors are
    1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42 and 84.

    The \key{sum of factors} of $n$ is
    \[\sigma(n)=\prod_{i=1}^k (1+p_i+\ldots+p_i^{\alpha_i}) = \prod_{i=1}^k \frac{p_i^{a_i+1}-1}{p_i-1},\]
    where the latter formula is based on the geometric progression formula.
    For example, the sum of factors of 84 is
    \[\sigma(84)=\frac{2^3-1}{2-1} \cdot \frac{3^2-1}{3-1} \cdot \frac{7^2-1}{7-1} = 7 \cdot 4 \cdot 8 = 224.\]

    The \key{product of factors} of $n$ is
    \[\mu(n)=n^{\tau(n)/2},\]
    because we can form $\tau(n)/2$ pairs from the factors,
    each with product $n$.
    For example, the factors of 84
    produce the pairs
    $1 \cdot 84$, $2 \cdot 42$, $3 \cdot 28$, etc.,
    and the product of the factors is $\mu(84)=84^6=351298031616$.

    \index{perfect number}

    A number $n$ is called a \key{perfect number} if $n=\sigma(n)-n$,
    i.e., $n$ equals the sum of its factors
    between $1$ and $n-1$.
    For example, 28 is a perfect number,
    because $28=1+2+4+7+14$.

    \subsubsection{Number of primes}

    It is easy to show that there is an infinite number
    of primes.
    If the number of primes would be finite,
    we could construct a set $P=\{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n\}$
    that would contain all the primes.
    For example, $p_1=2$, $p_2=3$, $p_3=5$, and so on.
    However, using $P$, we could form a new prime
    \[p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n+1\]
    that is larger than all elements in $P$.
    This is a contradiction, and the number of primes
    has to be infinite.

    \subsubsection{Density of primes}

    The density of primes means how often there are primes
    among the numbers.
    Let $\pi(n)$ denote the number of primes between
    $1$ and $n$. For example, $\pi(10)=4$, because
    there are 4 primes between $1$ and $10$: 2, 3, 5 and 7.

    It is possible to show that
    \[\pi(n) \approx \frac{n}{\ln n},\]
    which means that primes are quite frequent.
    For example, the number of primes between
    $1$ and $10^6$ is $\pi(10^6)=78498$,
    and $10^6 / \ln 10^6 \approx 72382$.

    \subsubsection{Conjectures}

    There are many \emph{conjectures} involving primes.
    Most people think that the conjectures are true,
    but nobody has been able to prove them.
    For example, the following conjectures are famous:

    \begin{itemize}
    \index{Goldbach's conjecture}
    \item \key{Goldbach's conjecture}:
    Each even integer $n>2$ can be represented as a
    sum $n=a+b$ so that both $a$ and $b$ are primes.
    \index{twin prime}
    \item \key{Twin prime conjecture}:
    There is an infinite number of pairs
    of the form $\{p,p+2\}$,
    where both $p$ and $p+2$ are primes.
    \index{Legendre's conjecture}
    \item \key{Legendre's conjecture}:
    There is always a prime between numbers
    $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$, where $n$ is any positive integer.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Basic algorithms}

    If a number $n$ is not prime,
    it can be represented as a product $a \cdot b$,
    where $a \le \sqrt n$ or $b \le \sqrt n$,
    so it certainly has a factor between $2$ and $\lfloor \sqrt n \rfloor$.
    Using this observation, we can both test
    if a number is prime and find the prime factorization
    of a number in $O(\sqrt n)$ time.

    The following function \texttt{prime} checks
    if the given number $n$ is prime.
    The function attempts to divide $n$ by
    all numbers between $2$ and $\lfloor \sqrt n \rfloor$,
    and if none of them divides $n$, then $n$ is prime.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    bool prime(int n) {
        if (n < 2) return false;
        for (int x = 2; x*x <= n; x++) {
            if (n%x == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \noindent
    The following function \texttt{factors}
    constructs a vector that contains the prime
    factorization of $n$.
    The function divides $n$ by its prime factors,
    and adds them to the vector.
    The process ends when the remaining number $n$
    has no factors between $2$ and $\lfloor \sqrt n \rfloor$.
    If $n>1$, it is prime and the last factor.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    vector<int> factors(int n) {
        vector<int> f;
        for (int x = 2; x*x <= n; x++) {
            while (n%x == 0) {
                f.push_back(x);
                n /= x;
            }
        }
        if (n > 1) f.push_back(n);
        return f;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that each prime factor appears in the vector
    as many times as it divides the number.
    For example, $24=2^3 \cdot 3$,
    so the result of the function is $[2,2,2,3]$.

    \subsubsection{Sieve of Eratosthenes}

    \index{sieve of Eratosthenes}

    The \key{sieve of Eratosthenes}
    %\footnote{Eratosthenes (c. 276 BC -- c. 194 BC) was a Greek mathematician.}
    is a preprocessing
    algorithm that builds an array using which we
    can efficiently check if a given number between $2 \ldots n$
    is prime and, if it is not, find one prime factor of the number.

    The algorithm builds an array $\texttt{sieve}$
    whose positions $2,3,\ldots,n$ are used.
    The value $\texttt{sieve}[k]=0$ means
    that $k$ is prime,
    and the value $\texttt{sieve}[k] \neq 0$
    means that $k$ is not a prime and one
    of its prime factors is $\texttt{sieve}[k]$.

    The algorithm iterates through the numbers
    $2 \ldots n$ one by one.
    Always when a new prime $x$ is found,
    the algorithm records that the multiples
    of $x$ ($2x,3x,4x,\ldots$) are not primes,
    because the number $x$ divides them.

    For example, if $n=20$, the array is as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (19,1);

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/803 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: We need to create a function that checks if a given number is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares (1=1^2, 2=2^2, 3=3^2, 4=4^2), while 2, 3, 5, and 10 are not.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To determine if a number is a perfect square, we can take the integer square root of the number and then square it again. If the result matches the original number, then it is a perfect square. If not, it is not a perfect square.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function is_perfect_square(n):
       if n < 0:
           return False
       sqrt_n = integer square root of n
       return sqrt_n * sqrt_n == n
   ```

def is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the number is negative, as negative numbers cannot be perfect squares
    if n < 0:
        return False
    
    # Calculate the integer square root of n
