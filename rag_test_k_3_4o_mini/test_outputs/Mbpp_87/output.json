    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes three dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are duplicate keys across the dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary should be used.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To merge the three dictionaries, we can start with an empty dictionary and then iterate through each of the three dictionaries. For each key-value pair in the dictionaries, we will add the key and its corresponding value to the new dictionary. If a key already exists in the new dictionary, it will be updated with the value from the current dictionary being processed.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):\n       create an empty dictionary called merged_dict\n       for each key-value pair in dict1:\n           add key and value to merged_dict\n       for each key-value pair in dict2:\n           add key and value to merged_dict\n       for each key-value pair in dict3:\n           add key and value to merged_dict\n       return merged_dict\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to hold the merged result\n    merged_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through the first dictionary and add its items to merged_dict\n    for key, value in dict1.items():\n        merged_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Iterate through the second dictionary and add its items to merged_dict\n    for key, value in dict2.items():\n        merged_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Iterate through the third dictionary and add its items to merged_dict\n    for key, value in dict3.items():\n        merged_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Return the merged dictionary\n    return merged_dict\n```",
