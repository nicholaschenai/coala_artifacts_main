INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/87 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes three dictionaries as input and combines them into a single dictionary. If there are any duplicate keys among the dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary should be used.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To merge the three dictionaries, we can start with an empty dictionary and then add the key-value pairs from each of the three dictionaries one by one. If a key already exists in the resulting dictionary, it will be updated with the new value from the last dictionary.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `merge_dictionaries_three` that takes three dictionaries as parameters.
   - Initialize an empty dictionary to hold the merged result.
   - For each dictionary in the input:
     - Iterate through each key-value pair in the dictionary.
     - Add the key-value pair to the result dictionary (this will overwrite any existing key).
   - Return the merged result dictionary.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the merged result
    merged_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate through the first dictionary and add its items to the merged dictionary
    for key, value in dict1.items():
        merged_dict[key] = value
    
    # Iterate through the second dictionary and add its items to the merged dictionary
    for key, value in dict2.items():
        merged_dict[key] = value
    
    # Iterate through the third dictionary and add its items to the merged dictionary
    for key, value in dict3.items():
        merged_dict[key] = value
    
    # Return the merged dictionary
    return merged_dict

    \subsubsection*{Diophantine equations}

    \index{Diophantine equation}

    A \key{Diophantine equation}
    %\footnote{Diophantus of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician who lived in the 3th century.}
    is an equation of the form
    \[ ax + by = c, \]
    where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants
    and the values of $x$ and $y$ should be found.
    Each number in the equation has to be an integer.
    For example, one solution for the equation
    $5x+2y=11$ is $x=3$ and $y=-2$.

    \index{extended Euclid's algorithm}

    We can efficiently solve a Diophantine equation
    by using Euclid's algorithm.
    It turns out that we can extend Euclid's algorithm
    so that it will find numbers $x$ and $y$
    that satisfy the following equation:
    \[
    ax + by = \textrm{gcd}(a,b)
    \]

    A Diophantine equation can be solved if
    $c$ is divisible by
    $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)$,
    and otherwise it cannot be solved.

    As an example, let us find numbers $x$ and $y$
    that satisfy the following equation:
    \[
    39x + 15y = 12
    \]
    The equation can be solved, because
    $\textrm{gcd}(39,15)=3$ and $3 \mid 12$.
    When Euclid's algorithm calculates the
    greatest common divisor of 39 and 15,
    it produces the following sequence of function calls:
    \[
    \textrm{gcd}(39,15) = \textrm{gcd}(15,9)
    = \textrm{gcd}(9,6) = \textrm{gcd}(6,3)
    = \textrm{gcd}(3,0) = 3 \]
    This corresponds to the following equations:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    39 - 2 \cdot 15 & = & 9 \\
    15 - 1 \cdot 9 & = & 6 \\
    9 - 1 \cdot 6 & = & 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    Using these equations, we can derive
    \[
    39 \cdot 2 + 15 \cdot (-5) = 3
    \]
    and by multiplying this by 4, the result is
    \[
    39 \cdot 8 + 15 \cdot (-20) = 12,
    \]
    so a solution to the equation is
    $x=8$ and $y=-20$.

    A solution to a Diophantine equation is not unique,
    because we can form an infinite number of solutions
    if we know one solution.
    If a pair $(x,y)$ is a solution, then also all pairs
    \[(x+\frac{kb}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)},y-\frac{ka}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)})\]
    are solutions, where $k$ is any integer.

    \subsubsection{Chinese remainder theorem}

    \index{Chinese remainder theorem}

    The \key{Chinese remainder theorem} solves
    a group of equations of the form
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    x & = & a_1 \bmod m_1 \\
    x & = & a_2 \bmod m_2 \\
    \cdots \\
    x & = & a_n \bmod m_n \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    where all pairs of $m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_n$ are coprime.

    Let $x^{-1}_m$ be the inverse of $x$ modulo $m$, and
    \[ X_k = \frac{m_1 m_2 \cdots m_n}{m_k}.\]
    Using this notation, a solution to the equations is
    \[x = a_1 X_1 {X_1}^{-1}_{m_1} + a_2 X_2 {X_2}^{-1}_{m_2} + \cdots + a_n X_n {X_n}^{-1}_{m_n}.\]
    In this solution, for each $k=1,2,\ldots,n$,
    \[a_k X_k {X_k}^{-1}_{m_k} \bmod m_k = a_k,\]
    because
    \[X_k {X_k}^{-1}_{m_k} \bmod m_k = 1.\]
    Since all other terms in the sum are divisible by $m_k$,
    they have no effect on the remainder,
    and $x \bmod m_k = a_k$.

    For example, a solution for
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    x & = & 3 \bmod 5 \\
    x & = & 4 \bmod 7 \\
    x & = & 2 \bmod 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    is
    \[ 3 \cdot 21 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 15 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 35 \cdot 2 = 263.\]

    Once we have found a solution $x$,
    we can create an infinite number of other solutions,
    because all numbers of the form
    \[x+m_1 m_2 \cdots m_n\]
    are solutions.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 1/5
    # The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

    The inclusion-exclusion principle is an important combinatorial way to compute the size of a set or the probability of complex events. It relates the sizes of individual sets with their union.

    ## Statement

    ### The verbal formula

    The inclusion-exclusion principle can be expressed as follows:

    To compute the size of a union of multiple sets, it is necessary to sum the sizes of these sets **separately**, and then subtract the sizes of all **pairwise** intersections of the sets, then add back the size of the intersections of **triples** of the sets, subtract the size of **quadruples** of the sets, and so on, up to the intersection of **all** sets.

    ### The formulation in terms of sets

    The above definition can be expressed mathematically as follows:

    $$\left| \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{i=1}^n|A_i| - \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} |A_i \cap A_j| + \sum _{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}|A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} | A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n |$$

    And in a more compact way:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\Biggl |}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr |}$$

    ### The formulation using Venn diagrams

    Let the diagram show three sets $A$, $B$ and $C$:

    ![Venn diagram](venn-inclusion-exclusion.png "Venn diagram")

    Then the area of their union $A \cup B \cup C$ is equal to the sum of the areas $A$, $B$ and $C$ less double-covered areas $A \cap B$, $A \cap C$, $B \cap C$, but with the addition of the area covered by three sets $A \cap B \cap C$:

    $$S(A \cup B \cup C) = S(A) + S(B) + S(C) - S(A \cap B) - S(A \cap C) - S(B \cap C) + S(A \cap B \cap C)$$

    It can also be generalized for an association of $n$ sets.

    ### The formulation in terms of probability theory

    If $A_i$ $(i = 1,2...n)$ are events and ${\cal P}(A_i)$ the probability of an event from $A_i$ to occur, then the probability of their union (i.e. the probability that at least one of the events occur) is equal to:

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    {\cal P} \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right) &=& \sum_{i=1}^n{\cal P}(A_i)\ - \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} {\cal P}(A_i \cap A_j)\  + \\
    &+& \sum _{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}{\cal P}(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k) - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} {\cal P}( A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n )
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    And in a more compact way:

    $${\cal P} \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right) = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\ {\cal P}{\Biggl (}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr )}$$

    ## Proof

    For the proof it is convenient to use the mathematical formulation in terms of set theory:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\Biggl |}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr |}$$

    We want to prove that any element contained in at least one of the sets $A_i$ will occur in the formula only once (note that elements which are not present in any of the sets $A_i$ will never be considered on the right part of the formula).

    Consider an element $x$ occurring in $k \geq 1$ sets $A_i$. We will show it is counted only once in the formula. Note that:

    * in terms which $|J| = 1$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\ k$** times;
    * in terms which $|J| = 2$, the item $x$ will be counted **$-\ \binom{k}{2}$** times - because it will be counted in those terms that include two of the $k$ sets containing $x$;
    * in terms which $|J| = 3$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\ \binom{k}{3}$** times;
    * $\cdots$
    * in terms which $|J| = k$, the item $x$ will be counted **$(-1)^{k-1}\cdot \binom{k}{k}$** times;
    * in terms which $|J| \gt k$, the item $x$ will be counted **zero** times;

    This leads us to the following sum of [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ T = \binom{k}{1} - \binom{k}{2} + \binom{k}{3} - \cdots + (-1)^{i-1}\cdot \binom{k}{i} + \cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\cdot \binom{k}{k}$$

    This expression is very similar to the binomial expansion of $(1 - x)^k$:

    $$ (1 - x)^k = \binom{k}{0} - \binom{k}{1} \cdot x + \binom{k}{2} \cdot x^2 - \binom{k}{3} \cdot x^3 + \cdots + (-1)^k\cdot \binom{k}{k} \cdot x^k $$

    When $x = 1$, $(1 - x)^k$ looks a lot like $T$. However, the expression has an additional $\binom{k}{0} = 1$, and it is multiplied by $-1$. That leads us to $(1 - 1)^k = 1 - T$. Therefore $T = 1 - (1 - 1)^k = 1$, what was required to prove. The element is counted only once.

    ## Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly $r$ sets {data-toc-label="Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly r sets"}

    Inclusion-exclusion principle can be rewritten to calculate number of elements which are present in zero sets:

    $$\left|\bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A_i}\right|=\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \sum_{|X|=m} \left|\bigcap_{i\in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    Consider its generalization to calculate number of elements which are present in exactly $r$ sets:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{|B|=r}\left[\bigcap_{i \in B} A_i \cap \bigcap_{j \not\in B} \overline{A_j}\right]\right|=\sum_{m=r}^n (-1)^{m-r}\dbinom{m}{r} \sum_{|X|=m} \left|\bigcap_{i \in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    To prove this formula, consider some particular $B$. Due to basic inclusion-exclusion principle we can say about it that:

    $$\left|\bigcap_{i \in B} A_i \cap \bigcap_{j \not \in B} \overline{A_j}\right|=\sum_{m=r}^{n} (-1)^{m-r} \sum_{\substack{|X|=m \newline B \subset X}}\left|\bigcap_{i\in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    The sets on the left side do not intersect for different $B$, thus we can sum them up directly. Also one should note that any set $X$ will always have coefficient $(-1)^{m-r}$ if it occurs and it will occur for exactly $\dbinom{m}{r}$ sets $B$. 

    ## Usage when solving problems

    The inclusion-exclusion principle is hard to understand without studying its applications.

    First, we will look at three simplest tasks "at paper", illustrating applications of the principle, and then consider more practical problems which are difficult to solve without inclusion-exclusion principle.

    Tasks asking to "find the **number** of ways" are worth of note, as they sometimes lead to polynomial solutions, not necessarily exponential.

    ### A simple task on permutations

    Task: count how many permutations of numbers from $0$ to $9$ exist such that the first element is greater than $1$ and the last one is less than $8$.

    Let's count the number of "bad" permutations, that is, permutations in which the first element is $\leq 1$ and/or the last is $\geq 8$.

    We will denote by $X$ the set of permutations in which the first element is $\leq 1$ and $Y$ the set of permutations in which the last element is $\geq 8$. Then the number of "bad" permutations, as on the inclusion-exclusion formula, will be:

    $$ |X \cup Y| = |X| + |Y| - |X \cap Y| $$

    After a simple combinatorial calculation, we will get to:

    $$ 2 \cdot 9! + 2 \cdot 9! - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 8! $$

    The only thing left is to subtract this number from the total of $10!$ to get the number of "good" permutations.

    ### A simple task on (0, 1, 2) sequences

    Task: count how many sequences of length $n$ exist consisting only of numbers $0,1,2$ such that each number occurs **at least once**.

    Again let us turn to the inverse problem, i.e. we calculate the number of sequences which do **not** contain **at least one** of the numbers.

    Let's denote by $A_i (i = 0,1,2)$ the set of sequences in which the digit $i$ does **not** occur.
    The formula of inclusion-exclusion on the number of "bad" sequences will be:

    $$ |A_0 \cup A_1 \cup A_2| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_0 \cap A_1| - |A_0 \cap A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_2| + |A_0 \cap A_1 \cap A_2| $$

    * The size of each $A_i$ is $2^n$, as each sequence can only contain two of the digits.
    * The size of each pairwise intersection $A_i \cap A_j$  is equal to $1$, as there will be only one digit to build the sequence.
    * The size of the intersection of all three sets is equal to $0$, as there will be no digits to build the sequence.

    As we solved the inverse problem, we subtract it from the total of $3^n$ sequences:

    $$3^n - (3 \cdot 2^n - 3 \cdot 1 + 0)$$

    Title: Finding the nearest pair of points
    Part: 1/3
    # Finding the nearest pair of points

    ## Problem statement

    Given $n$ points on the plane. Each point $p_i$ is defined by its coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$. It is required to find among them two such points, such that the distance between them is minimal:

    $$ \min_{\scriptstyle i, j=0 \ldots n-1,\atop \scriptstyle i \neq j } \rho (p_i, p_j). $$

    We take the usual Euclidean distances:

    $$ \rho (p_i,p_j) = \sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2} .$$

    The trivial algorithm - iterating over all pairs and calculating the distance for each — works in $O(n^2)$. 

    The algorithm running in time $O(n \log n)$ is described below. This algorithm was proposed by Shamos and Hoey in 1975. (Source: Ch. 5 Notes of _Algorithm Design_ by Kleinberg & Tardos, also see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4567872)) Preparata and Shamos also showed that this algorithm is optimal in the decision tree model.

    ## Algorithm
    We construct an algorithm according to the general scheme of **divide-and-conquer** algorithms: the algorithm is designed as a recursive function, to which we pass a set of points; this recursive function splits this set in half, calls itself recursively on each half, and then performs some operations to combine the answers. The operation of combining consist of  detecting the cases when one point of the optimal solution fell into one half, and the other point into the other (in this case, recursive calls from each of the halves cannot detect this pair separately). The main difficulty, as always in case of divide and conquer algorithms, lies in the effective implementation of the merging stage. If a set of $n$ points is passed to the recursive function, then the merge stage should work no more than $O(n)$, then the asymptotics of the whole algorithm $T(n)$ will be found from the equation:

    $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).$$ 

    The solution to this equation, as is known, is $T(n) = O(n \log n).$

    So, we proceed on to the construction of the algorithm. In order to come to an effective implementation of the merge stage in the future, we will divide the set of points into two subsets, according to their $x$-coordinates: In fact, we draw some vertical line dividing the set of points into two subsets of approximately the same size. It is convenient to make such a partition as follows: We sort the points in the standard way as pairs of numbers, ie.:

    $$p_i < p_j \Longleftrightarrow (x_i < x_j) \lor \Big(\left(x_i = x_j\right) \wedge \left(y_i < y_j \right) \Big) $$

    Then take the middle point after sorting $p_m (m = \lfloor n/2 \rfloor)$, and all the points before it and the $p_m$ itself are assigned to the first half, and all the points after it - to the second half:

    $$A_1 = \{p_i \ | \ i = 0 \ldots m \}$$

    $$A_2 = \{p_i \ | \ i = m + 1 \ldots n-1 \}.$$ 

    Now, calling recursively on each of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, we will find the answers $h_1$ and $h_2$ for each of the halves. And take the best of them: $h = \min(h_1, h_2)$.

    Now we need to make a **merge stage**, i.e. we try to find such pairs of points, for which the distance between which is less than $h$ and one point is lying in $A_1$ and the other in $A_2$.
    It is obvious that it is sufficient to consider only those points that are separated from the vertical line by a distance less than $h$, i.e. the set $B$ of the points considered at this stage is equal to:

    $$B = \{ p_i\ | \ | x_i - x_m\ | < h \}.$$ 

    For each point in the set $B$, we try to find the points that are closer to it than $h$. For example, it is sufficient to consider only those points whose $y$-coordinate differs by no more than $h$. Moreover, it makes no sense to consider those points whose $y$-coordinate is greater than the $y$-coordinate of the current point. Thus, for each point $p_i$ we define the set of considered points $C(p_i)$ as follows:

    $$C(p_i) = \{ p_j\ |\ p_j \in B,\ \ y_i - h < y_j \le y_i \}.$$

    If we sort the points of the set $B$ by $y$-coordinate, it will be very easy to find $C(p_i)$: these are several points in a row ahead to the point $p_i$.

    So, in the new notation, the **merging stage** looks like this: build a set $B$, sort the points in it by $y$-coordinate, then for each point $p_i \in B$ consider all points $p_j \in C(p_i)$, and for each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ calculate the distance and compare with the current best distance.

    At first glance, this is still a non-optimal algorithm: it seems that the sizes of sets $C(p_i)$ will be of order $n$, and the required asymptotics will not work. However, surprisingly, it can be proved that the size of each of the sets $C(p_i)$ is a quantity $O(1)$, i.e. it does not exceed some small constant regardless of the points themselves. Proof of this fact is given in the next section.

    Finally, we pay attention to the sorting, which the above algorithm contains: first,sorting by pairs $(x, y)$, and then second, sorting the elements of the set $B$ by $y$. In fact, both of these sorts inside the recursive function can be eliminated (otherwise we would not reach the $O(n)$ estimate for the **merging stage**, and the general asymptotics of the algorithm would be $O(n \log^2 n)$). It is easy to get rid of the first sort — it is enough to perform this sort before starting the recursion: after all, the elements themselves do not change inside the recursion, so there is no need to sort again. With the second sorting a little more difficult to perform, performing it previously will not work. But, remembering the merge sort, which also works on the principle of divide-and-conquer, we can simply embed this sort in our recursion. Let recursion, taking some set of points (as we remember,ordered by pairs $(x, y)$), return the same set, but sorted by the $y$-coordinate. To do this, simply merge (in $O(n)$) the two results returned by recursive calls. This will result in a set sorted by $y$-coordinate.

    ## Evaluation of the asymptotics

    To show that the above algorithm is actually executed in $O(n \log n)$, we need to prove the following fact: $|C(p_i)| = O(1)$.

    So, let us consider some point $p_i$; recall that the set $C(p_i)$ is a set of points whose $y$-coordinate lies in the segment $[y_i-h; y_i]$, and, moreover, along the $x$ coordinate, the point $p_i$ itself, and all the points of the set $C(p_i)$ lie in the band width $2h$. In other words, the points we are considering $p_i$ and $C(p_i)$ lie in a rectangle of size $2h \times h$.

    Our task is to estimate the maximum number of points that can lie in this rectangle $2h \times h$; thus, we estimate the maximum size of the set $C(p_i)$. At the same time, when evaluating, we must not forget that there may be repeated points.

    Remember that $h$ was obtained from the results of two recursive calls — on sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ contains points to the left of the partition line and partially on it, $A_2$ contains the remaining points of the partition line and points to the right of it. For any pair of points from $A_1$, as well as from $A_2$, the distance can not be less than $h$ — otherwise it would mean incorrect operation of the recursive function.

    To estimate the maximum number of points in the rectangle $2h \times h$ we divide it into two squares $h \times h$, the first square include all points $C(p_i) \cap A_1$, and the second contains all the others, i.e. $C(p_i) \cap A_2$. It follows from the above considerations that in each of these squares the distance between any two points is at least $h$.

    We show that there are at most four points in each square. For example, this can be done as follows: divide the square into $4$ sub-squares with sides $h/2$. Then there can be no more than one point in each of these sub-squares (since even the diagonal is equal to $h / \sqrt{2}$, which is less than $h$). Therefore, there can be no more than $4$ points in the whole square.

    So, we have proved that in a rectangle $2h \times h$ can not be more than $4 \cdot 2 = 8$ points, and, therefore, the size of the set $C(p_i)$ cannot exceed $7$, as required.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/87 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes three dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are duplicate keys across the dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary should be used.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To merge the three dictionaries, we can start with an empty dictionary and then iterate through each of the three dictionaries. For each key-value pair in the dictionaries, we will add the key and its corresponding value to the new dictionary. If a key already exists in the new dictionary, it will be updated with the value from the current dictionary being processed.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):
       create an empty dictionary called merged_dict
       for each key-value pair in dict1:
           add key and value to merged_dict
       for each key-value pair in dict2:
           add key and value to merged_dict
       for each key-value pair in dict3:
           add key and value to merged_dict
       return merged_dict
   ```
