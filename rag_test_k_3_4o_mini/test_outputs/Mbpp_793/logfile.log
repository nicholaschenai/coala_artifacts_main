INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/793 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that finds the last occurrence of a specified element in a sorted array. If the element is not found, the function should return -1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the last position of an element in a sorted array, we can iterate through the array from the end to the beginning. This way, we can stop as soon as we find the element, ensuring that we are capturing the last occurrence. If we reach the beginning of the array without finding the element, we return -1.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function last(array, element):
       for index from length of array - 1 to 0:
           if array[index] is equal to element:
               return index
       return -1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def last(array, element):
    # Iterate through the array from the last index to the first
    for index in range(len(array) - 1, -1, -1):
        # Check if the current element matches the target element
        if array[index] == element:
            # Return the index of the last occurrence

    \index{binary search}

    A general method for searching for an element
    in an array is to use a \texttt{for} loop
    that iterates through the elements of the array.
    For example, the following code searches for
    an element $x$ in an array:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (array[i] == x) {
            // x found at index i
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$,
    because in the worst case, it is necessary to check
    all elements of the array.
    If the order of the elements is arbitrary,
    this is also the best possible approach, because
    there is no additional information available where
    in the array we should search for the element $x$.

    However, if the array is \emph{sorted},
    the situation is different.
    In this case it is possible to perform the
    search much faster, because the order of the
    elements in the array guides the search.
    The following \key{binary search} algorithm
    efficiently searches for an element in a sorted array
    in $O(\log n)$ time.

    \subsubsection{Method 1}

    The usual way to implement binary search
    resembles looking for a word in a dictionary.
    The search maintains an active region in the array,
    which initially contains all array elements.
    Then, a number of steps is performed,
    each of which halves the size of the region.

    At each step, the search checks the middle element
    of the active region.
    If the middle element is the target element,
    the search terminates.
    Otherwise, the search recursively continues
    to the left or right half of the region,
    depending on the value of the middle element.

    The above idea can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a = 0, b = n-1;
    while (a <= b) {
        int k = (a+b)/2;
        if (array[k] == x) {
            // x found at index k
        }
        if (array[k] > x) b = k-1;
        else a = k+1;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    In this implementation, the active region is $a \ldots b$,
    and initially the region is $0 \ldots n-1$.
    The algorithm halves the size of the region at each step,
    so the time complexity is $O(\log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Method 2}

    An alternative method to implement binary search
    is based on an efficient way to iterate through
    the elements of the array.
    The idea is to make jumps and slow the speed
    when we get closer to the target element.

    The search goes through the array from left to
    right, and the initial jump length is $n/2$.
    At each step, the jump length will be halved:
    first $n/4$, then $n/8$, $n/16$, etc., until
    finally the length is 1.
    After the jumps, either the target element has
    been found or we know that it does not appear in the array.

    The following code implements the above idea:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int k = 0;
    for (int b = n/2; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (k+b < n && array[k+b] <= x) k += b;
    }
    if (array[k] == x) {
        // x found at index k
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    During the search, the variable $b$
    contains the current jump length.
    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(\log n)$,
    because the code in the \texttt{while} loop
    is performed at most twice for each jump length.

    \subsubsection{C++ functions}

    The C++ standard library contains the following functions
    that are based on binary search and work in logarithmic time:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{lower\_bound} returns a pointer to the
    first array element whose value is at least $x$.
    \item \texttt{upper\_bound} returns a pointer to the
    first array element whose value is larger than $x$.
    \item \texttt{equal\_range} returns both above pointers.
    \end{itemize}

    The functions assume that the array is sorted.
    If there is no such element, the pointer points to
    the element after the last array element.
    For example, the following code finds out whether
    an array contains an element with value $x$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto k = lower_bound(array,array+n,x)-array;
    if (k < n && array[k] == x) {
        // x found at index k
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Then, the following code counts the number of elements
    whose value is $x$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto a = lower_bound(array, array+n, x);
    auto b = upper_bound(array, array+n, x);
    cout << b-a << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    Using \texttt{equal\_range}, the code becomes shorter:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto r = equal_range(array, array+n, x);
    cout << r.second-r.first << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Finding the smallest solution}

    An important use for binary search is
    to find the position where the value of a \emph{function} changes.
    Suppose that we wish to find the smallest value $k$
    that is a valid solution for a problem.
    We are given a function $\texttt{ok}(x)$
    that returns \texttt{true} if $x$ is a valid solution
    and \texttt{false} otherwise.
    In addition, we know that $\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \texttt{false}
    when $x<k$ and \texttt{true} when $x \ge k$.
    The situation looks as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrr}
    $x$ & 0 & 1 & $\cdots$ & $k-1$ & $k$ & $k+1$ & $\cdots$ \\
    \hline
    $\texttt{ok}(x)$ & \texttt{false} & \texttt{false}
    & $\cdots$ & \texttt{false} & \texttt{true} & \texttt{true} & $\cdots$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \noindent
    Now, the value of $k$ can be found using binary search:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int x = -1;
    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (!ok(x+b)) x += b;
    }
    int k = x+1;
    \end{lstlisting}

    The search finds the largest value of $x$ for which
    $\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \texttt{false}.
    Thus, the next value $k=x+1$
    is the smallest possible value for which
    $\texttt{ok}(k)$ is \texttt{true}.
    The initial jump length $z$ has to be
    large enough, for example some value
    for which we know beforehand that $\texttt{ok}(z)$ is \texttt{true}.

    The algorithm calls the function \texttt{ok}
    $O(\log z)$ times, so the total time complexity
    depends on the function \texttt{ok}.
    For example, if the function works in $O(n)$ time,
    the total time complexity is $O(n \log z)$.

    \subsubsection{Finding the maximum value}

    Binary search can also be used to find
    the maximum value for a function that is
    first increasing and then decreasing.
    Our task is to find a position $k$ such that

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    $f(x)<f(x+1)$ when $x<k$, and
    \item
    $f(x)>f(x+1)$ when $x \ge k$.
    \end{itemize}

    The idea is to use binary search
    for finding the largest value of $x$
    for which $f(x)<f(x+1)$.
    This implies that $k=x+1$
    because $f(x+1)>f(x+2)$.
    The following code implements the search: 

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int x = -1;
    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (f(x+b) < f(x+b+1)) x += b;
    }
    int k = x+1;
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that unlike in the ordinary binary search,
    here it is not allowed that consecutive values
    of the function are equal.
    In this case it would not be possible to know
    how to continue the search.

    # Binary search

    **Binary search** is a method that allows for quicker search of something by splitting the search interval into two. Its most common application is searching values in sorted arrays, however the splitting idea is crucial in many other typical tasks.

    ## Search in sorted arrays

    The most typical problem that leads to the binary search is as follows. You're given a sorted array $A_0 \leq A_1 \leq \dots \leq A_{n-1}$, check if $k$ is present within the sequence. The simplest solution would be to check every element one by one and compare it with $k$ (a so-called linear search). This approach works in $O(n)$, but doesn't utilize the fact that the array is sorted.

    </center>

    Now assume that we know two indices $L < R$ such that $A_L \leq k \leq A_R$. Because the array is sorted, we can deduce that $k$ either occurs among $A_L, A_{L+1}, \dots, A_R$ or doesn't occur in the array at all. If we pick an arbitrary index $M$ such that $L < M < R$ and check whether $k$ is less or greater than $A_M$. We have two possible cases:

    1. $A_L \leq k \leq A_M$. In this case, we reduce the problem from $[L, R]$ to $[L, M]$;
    1. $A_M \leq k \leq A_R$. In this case, we reduce the problem from $[L, R]$ to $[M, R]$.

    When it is impossible to pick  $M$, that is, when $R = L + 1$, we directly compare $k$ with $A_L$ and $A_R$. Otherwise we would want to pick $M$ in such manner that it reduces the active segment to a single element as quickly as possible _in the worst case_.

    Since in the worst case we will always reduce to larger segment of $[L, M]$ and $[M, R]$. Thus, in the worst case scenario the reduction would be from $R-L$ to $\max(M-L, R-M)$. To minimize this value, we should pick $M \approx \frac{L+R}{2}$, then

    $$
    M-L \approx \frac{R-L}{2} \approx R-M.
    $$

    In other words, from the worst-case scenario perspective it is optimal to always pick $M$ in the middle of $[L, R]$ and split it in half. Thus, the active segment halves on each step until it becomes of size $1$. So, if the process needs $h$ steps, in the end it reduces the difference between $R$ and $L$ from $R-L$ to $\frac{R-L}{2^h} \approx 1$, giving us the equation $2^h \approx R-L$.

    Taking $\log_2$ on both sides, we get $h \approx \log_2(R-L) \in O(\log n)$.

    Logarithmic number of steps is drastically better than that of linear search. For example, for $n \approx 2^{20} \approx 10^6$ you'd need to make approximately a million operations for linear search, but only around $20$ operations with the binary search.

    ### Lower bound and upper bound

    It is often convenient to find the position of the first element that is not less than $k$ (called the lower bound of $k$ in the array) or the position of the first element that is greater than $k$ (called the upper bound of $k$) rather than the exact position of the element.

    Together, lower and upper bounds produce a possibly empty half-interval of the array elements that are equal to $k$. To check whether $k$ is present in the array it's enough to find its lower bound and check if the corresponding element equates to $k$.

    ### Implementation

    The explanation above provides a rough description of the algorithm. For the implementation details, we'd need to be more precise.

    We will maintain a pair $L < R$ such that $A_L \leq k < A_R$. Meaning that the active search interval is $[L, R)$. We use half-interval here instead of a segment $[L, R]$ as it turns out to require less corner case work.

    When $R = L+1$, we can deduce from definitions above that $R$ is the upper bound of $k$. It is convenient to initialize $R$ with past-the-end index, that is $R=n$ and $L$ with before-the-beginning index, that is $L=-1$. It is fine as long as we never evaluate $A_L$ and $A_R$ in our algorithm directly, formally treating it as $A_L = -\infty$ and $A_R = +\infty$.

    Finally, to be specific about the value of $M$ we pick, we will stick with $M = \lfloor \frac{L+R}{2} \rfloor$.

    Then the implementation could look like this:

    ```cpp
    ... // a sorted array is stored as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]
    int l = -1, r = n;
    while(r - l > 1) {
        int m = (l + r) / 2;
        if(k < a[m]) {
            r = m; // a[l] <= k < a[m] <= a[r]
        } else {
            l = m; // a[l] <= a[m] <= k < a[r]
        }
    }
    ```

    During the execution of the algorithm, we never evaluate neither $A_L$ nor $A_R$, as $L < M < R$. In the end, $L$ will be the index of the last element that is not greater than $k$ (or $-1$ if there is no such element) and $R$ will be the index of the first element larger than $k$ (or $n$ if there is no such element).

    ## Search on arbitrary predicate

    Let $f : \{0,1,\dots, n-1\} \to \{0, 1\}$ be a boolean function defined on $0,1,\dots,n-1$ such that it is monotonous, that is

    $$
    f(0) \leq f(1) \leq \dots \leq f(n-1).
    $$

    The binary search, the way it is described above, finds the partition of the array by the predicate $f(M)$, holding the boolean value of $k < A_M$ expression. In other words, binary search finds the unique index $L$ such that $f(L) = 0$ and $f(R)=f(L+1)=1$.

    It is possible to use arbitrary monotonous predicate instead of $k < A_M$. It is particularly useful when the computation of $f(k)$ is requires too much time to actually compute it for every possible value.

    ```cpp
    ... // f(i) is a boolean function such that f(0) <= ... <= f(n-1)
    int l = -1, r = n;
    while(r - l > 1) {
        int m = (l + r) / 2;
        if(f(m)) {
            r = m; // 0 = f(l) < f(m) = 1
        } else {
            l = m; // 0 = f(m) < f(r) = 1
        }
    }

    Part: 2/3
    ```

    ### Alternative way of restoring the subsequence

    It is also possible to restore the subsequence without the auxiliary array $p[]$.
    We can simply recalculate the current value of $d[i]$ and also see how the maximum was reached.

    This method leads to a slightly longer code, but in return we save some memory.

    ## Solution in $O(n \log n)$ with dynamic programming and binary search {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n log n) with dynamic programming and binary search"}

    In order to obtain a faster solution for the problem, we construct a different dynamic programming solution that runs in $O(n^2)$, and then later improve it to $O(n \log n)$.

    We will use the dynamic programming array $d[0 \dots n]$.
    This time $d[l]$ doesn't corresponds to the element $a[i]$ or to an prefix of the array. 
    $d[l]$ will be the smallest element at which an increasing subsequence of length $l$ ends.

    Initially we assume $d[0] = -\infty$ and for all other lengths $d[l] = \infty$.

    We will again gradually process the numbers, first $a[0]$, then $a[1]$, etc, and in each step maintain the array $d[]$ so that it is up to date.

    !!! example

        Given the array $a = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\}$, here are all their prefixes and their dynamic programming array.
        Notice, that the values of the array don't always change at the end.

        $$
        \begin{array}{ll}
        \text{prefix} = \{\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 8, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 3, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 3, 4, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 3, 4, 6, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 3, 4, 5, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 2, 4, 5, \infty, \dots \}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 0, 4, 5, \infty, \dots \}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 0, 4, 5, 7, \infty, \dots \}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 0, 4, 5, 7, 9, \infty, \dots \}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 0, 1, 5, 7, 9, \infty, \dots \}\\
        \end{array}
        $$

    When we process $a[i]$, we can ask ourselves.
    What have the conditions to be, that we write the current number $a[i]$ into the $d[0 \dots n]$ array?

    We set $d[l] = a[i]$, if there is a longest increasing sequence of length $l$ that ends in $a[i]$, and there is no longest increasing sequence of length $l$ that ends in a smaller number.
    Similar to the previous approach, if we remove the number $a[i]$ from the longest increasing sequence of length $l$, we get another longest increasing sequence of length $l -1$.
    So we want to extend a longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ by the number $a[i]$, and obviously the longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ that ends with the smallest element will work the best, in other words the sequence of length $l-1$ that ends in element $d[l-1]$.

    There is a longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ that we can extend with the number $a[i]$, exactly if $d[l-1] < a[i]$.
    So we can just iterate over each length $l$, and check if we can extend a longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ by checking the criteria.

    Additionally we also need to check, if we maybe have already found a longest increasing sequence of length $l$ with a smaller number at the end.
    So we only update if $a[i] < d[l]$.

    After processing all the elements of $a[]$ the length of the desired subsequence is the largest $l$ with $d[l] < \infty$.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_method2_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        const int INF = 1e9;
        vector<int> d(n+1, INF);
        d[0] = -INF;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int l = 1; l <= n; l++) {
                if (d[l-1] < a[i] && a[i] < d[l])
                    d[l] = a[i];
            }
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int l = 0; l <= n; l++) {
            if (d[l] < INF)
                ans = l;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    We now make two important observations.

    1.  The array $d$ will always be sorted: 
        $d[l-1] < d[l]$ for all $i = 1 \dots n$.

        This is trivial, as you can just remove the last element from the increasing subsequence of length $l$, and you get a increasing subsequence of length $l-1$ with a smalller ending number.

    2.  The element $a[i]$ will only update at most one value $d[l]$.

        This follows immediately from the above implementation.
        There can only be one place in the array with $d[l-1] < a[i] < d[l]$.

    Thus we can find this element in the array $d[]$ using [binary search](../num_methods/binary_search.md) in $O(\log n)$.
    In fact we can simply look in the array $d[]$ for the first number that is strictly greater than $a[i]$, and we try to update this element in the same way as the above implementation.

    ### Implementation

    This gives us the improved $O(n \log n)$ implementation:

    ```{.cpp file=lis_method2_nlogn}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        const int INF = 1e9;
        vector<int> d(n+1, INF);
        d[0] = -INF;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int l = upper_bound(d.begin(), d.end(), a[i]) - d.begin();
            if (d[l-1] < a[i] && a[i] < d[l])
                d[l] = a[i];
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int l = 0; l <= n; l++) {
            if (d[l] < INF)
                ans = l;
        }
        return ans;
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/793 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a Python function that finds the last position (index) of a specified element in a sorted array. If the element is not found, the function should return -1.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: Since the array is sorted, we can use a binary search approach to efficiently find the last occurrence of the specified element. The idea is to repeatedly divide the search interval in half. If the middle element is equal to the target, we continue searching in the right half to find the last occurrence. If the middle element is less than the target, we search in the right half; if it is greater, we search in the left half.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function last(array, target):
       initialize left to 0
       initialize right to length of array - 1
       initialize result to -1
       
       while left <= right:
           middle = (left + right) // 2
           if array[middle] == target:
               result = middle  // update result to current middle
               left = middle + 1  // search in the right half
           elif array[middle] < target:
               left = middle + 1  // search in the right half
           else:
               right = middle - 1  // search in the left half
       
       return result
   ```

```python
def last(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(array) - 1
