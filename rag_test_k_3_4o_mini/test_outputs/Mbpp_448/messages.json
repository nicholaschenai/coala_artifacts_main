(In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).\n\n    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):\n\n     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \\ldots$\n\n    ### Application in some combinatorial problems\n\n    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for\n\n    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.\n    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.\n    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.\n    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).\n    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.\n    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).\n    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \\times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).\n    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).\n    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.\n    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \\ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).\n\n\n    ## Calculations\n\n    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.\n\n    ### Recursive formula\n \n    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$\n\n    $$C_n = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \\geq 2$$\n\n    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.\n\n    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :\n\n    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    #### C++ implementation \n\n    ```cpp\n    const int MOD = ....\n    const int MAX = ....\n    int catalan[MAX];\n    void init() {\n        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;\n        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {\n            catalan[i] = 0;\n            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {\n                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;\n                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {\n                    catalan[i] -= MOD;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Analytical formula\n\n    $$C_n = \\frac{1}{n + 1} {\\binom{2n}{n}}$$\n\n    (here $\\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).\n\n    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \\times n$ is given by $\\binom{2n}{n}$.\n\n    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \\times n$.\n\n    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ are $\\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as \"bad\" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above \"bad\" paths, obtaining the formula:\n\n    $$C_n = \\binom{2n}{n} - \\binom{2n}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\binom{2n}{n} , {n} \\geq 0$$\n\n    ## Reference\n\n    - [Catalan Number by Tom Davis](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/catalan.pdf)\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Fibonacci Numbers\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Fibonacci Numbers\n\n    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n\n    $$F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$\n\n    The first elements of the sequence ([OEIS A000045](http://oeis.org/A000045)) are:\n\n    $$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$\n\n    ## Properties\n\n    Fibonacci numbers possess a lot of interesting properties. Here are a few of them:\n\n    * Cassini's identity:\n  \n    $$F_{n-1} F_{n+1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n$$\n\n    * The \"addition\" rule:\n  \n    $$F_{n+k} = F_k F_{n+1} + F_{k-1} F_n$$\n\n    * Applying the previous identity to the case $k = n$, we get:\n  \n    $$F_{2n} = F_n (F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})$$\n\n    * From this we can prove by induction that for any positive integer $k$,  $F_{nk}$ is multiple of $F_n$.\n\n    * The inverse is also true: if $F_m$ is multiple of $F_n$, then $m$ is multiple of $n$.\n\n    * GCD identity:\n  \n    $$GCD(F_m, F_n) = F_{GCD(m, n)}$$\n\n    * Fibonacci numbers are the worst possible inputs for Euclidean algorithm (see Lame's theorem in [Euclidean algorithm](euclid-algorithm.md))\n\n    ## Fibonacci Coding\n\n    We can use the sequence to encode positive integers into binary code words. According to Zeckendorf's theorem, any natural number $n$ can be uniquely represented as a sum of Fibonacci numbers:\n\n    $$N = F_{k_1} + F_{k_2} + \\ldots + F_{k_r}$$\n\n    such that $k_1 \\ge k_2 + 2,\\ k_2 \\ge k_3 + 2,\\  \\ldots,\\  k_r \\ge 2$ (i.e.: the representation cannot use two consecutive Fibonacci numbers).\n\n    It follows that any number can be uniquely encoded in the Fibonacci coding.\n    And we can describe this representation with binary codes $d_0 d_1 d_2 \\dots d_s 1$, where $d_i$ is $1$ if $F_{i+2}$ is used in the representation.\n    The code will be appended by a $1$ do indicate the end of the code word.\n    Notice that this is the only occurrence where two consecutive 1-bits appear.\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    1 &=& 1 &=& F_2 &=& (11)_F \\\\\n    2 &=& 2 &=& F_3 &=& (011)_F \\\\\n    6 &=& 5 + 1 &=& F_5 + F_2 &=& (10011)_F \\\\\n    8 &=& 8 &=& F_6 &=& (000011)_F \\\\\n    9 &=& 8 + 1 &=& F_6 + F_2 &=& (100011)_F \\\\\n    19 &=& 13 + 5 + 1 &=& F_7 + F_5 + F_2 &=& (1001011)_F\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    The encoding of an integer $n$ can be done with a simple greedy algorithm:\n\n    1. Iterate through the Fibonacci numbers from the largest to the smallest until you find one less than or equal to $n$.\n\n    2. Suppose this number was $F_i$. Subtract $F_i$ from $n$ and put a $1$ in the $i-2$ position of the code word (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit).\n\n    3. Repeat until there is no remainder.\n\n    4. Add a final $1$ to the codeword to indicate its end.\n\n    To decode a code word, first remove the final $1$. Then, if the $i$-th bit is set (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit), sum $F_{i+2}$ to the number.\n\n\n    ## Formulas for the $n^{\\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number { data-toc-label=\"Formulas for the <script type='math/tex'>n</script>-th Fibonacci number\" }\n\n    ### Closed-form expression\n\n    There is a formula known as \"Binet's formula\", even though it was already known by Moivre:\n\n    $$F_n = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt{5}}$$\n\n    This formula is easy to prove by induction, but it can be deduced with the help of the concept of generating functions or by solving a functional equation.\n\n    You can immediately notice that the second term's absolute value is always less than $1$, and it also decreases very rapidly (exponentially). Hence the value of the first term alone is \"almost\" $F_n$. This can be written strictly as: \n\n    $$F_n = \\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right]$$\n\n    where the square brackets denote rounding to the nearest integer.\n\n    As these two formulas would require very high accuracy when working with fractional numbers, they are of little use in practical calculations.\n\n    ### Fibonacci in linear time\n\n    The $n$-th Fibonacci number can be easily found in $O(n)$ by computing the numbers one by one up to $n$. However, there are also faster ways, as we will see.\n\n    We can start from an iterative approach, to take advantage of the use of the formula $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, therefore, we will simply precalculate those values in an array. Taking into account the base cases for $F_0$ and $F_1$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_linear}\n    int fib(int n) {\n        int a = 0;\n        int b = 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int tmp = a + b;\n            a = b;\n            b = tmp;\n        }\n        return a;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In this way, we obtain a linear solution, $O(n)$ time, saving all the values prior to $n$ in the sequence.\n\n    ### Matrix form\n\n    It is easy to prove the following relation:\n\n    $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\cr 1 & 0 \\cr\\end{pmatrix} ^ n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_{n} \\cr F_{n} & F_{n-1} \\cr\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n    Thus, in order to find $F_n$ in $O(log  n)$ time, we must raise the matrix to n. (See [Binary exponentiation](binary-exp.md))\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_matrix}\n    struct matrix {\n        long long mat[2][2];\n        matrix friend operator *(const matrix &a, const matrix &b){\n            matrix c;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n              for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {\n                  c.mat[i][j] = 0;\n                  for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {\n                      c.mat[i][j] += a.mat[i][k] * b.mat[k][j];\n                  }\n              }\n            }\n            return c;\n        }\n    };\n\n    matrix matpow(matrix base, long long n) {\n        matrix ans{ {\n          {1, 0},\n          {0, 1}\n        } };\n        while (n) {\n            if(n&1)\n                ans = ans*base;\n            base = base*base;\n            n >>= 1;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n\n    long long fib(int n) {\n        matrix base{ {\n          {1, 1},\n          {1, 0}\n        } };\n        return matpow(base, n).mat[0][1];\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Fast Doubling Method\n\n    Using expanding the above matrix expression for $n = 2\\cdot k$\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    F_{2k+1} & F_{2k}\\\\\n    F_{2k} & F_{2k-1}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    1 & 1\\\\\n    1 & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}^{2k}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    F_{k+1} & F_{k}\\\\\n    F_{k} & F_{k-1}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    ^2\n    $$\n\n    we can find these simpler equations:\n\n    $$ \\begin{align}\n    F_{2k+1} &= F_{k+1}^2 + F_{k}^2 \\\\\n    F_{2k} &= F_k(F_{k+1}+F_{k-1}) = F_k (2F_{k+1} - F_{k})\\\\\n    \\end{align}.$$\n\n    Thus using above two equations Fibonacci numbers can be calculated easily by the following code:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_doubling}\n    pair<int, int> fib (int n) {\n        if (n == 0)\n            return {0, 1};\n\n        auto p = fib(n >> 1);\n        int c = p.first * (2 * p.second - p.first);\n        int d = p.first * p.first + p.second * p.second;\n        if (n & 1)\n            return {d, c + d};\n        else\n            return {c, d};\n    }\n    ```\n    The above code returns $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ as a pair.\n\n    ## Periodicity modulo p\n\n    Consider the Fibonacci sequence modulo $p$. We will prove the sequence is periodic.\n\n    Let us prove this by contradiction. Consider the first $p^2 + 1$ pairs of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo $p$:\n\n    $$(F_0,\\ F_1),\\ (F_1,\\ F_2),\\ \\ldots,\\ (F_{p^2},\\ F_{p^2 + 1})$$\n\n    There can only be $p$ different remainders modulo $p$, and at most $p^2$ different pairs of remainders, so there are at least two identical pairs among them. This is sufficient to prove the sequence is periodic, as a Fibonacci number is only determined by it's two predecessors. Hence if two pairs of consecutive numbers repeat, that would also mean the numbers after the pair will repeat in the same fashion.\n\n    We now choose two pairs of identical remainders with the smallest indices in the sequence. Let the pairs be $(F_a,\\ F_{a + 1})$ and $(F_b,\\ F_{b + 1})$. We will prove that $a = 0$. If this was false, there would be two previous pairs $(F_{a-1},\\ F_a)$ and $(F_{b-1},\\ F_b)$, which, by the property of Fibonacci numbers, would also be equal. However, this contradicts the fact that we had chosen pairs with the smallest indices, completing our proof that there is no pre-period (i.e the numbers are periodic starting from $F_0$).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n    Part: 2/5\n    <div id=\"the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation\"></div>\n    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }\n\n    Consider the following equation:\n\n    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$\n\n    where $0 \\le x_i \\le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\\ldots 6)$.\n\n    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.\n\n    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):\n    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:\n\n    $$N_0 = \\binom{25}{5}$$\n\n    We will now calculate the number of \"bad\" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The \"bad\" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.\n\n    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \\ge 9$, and all other $x_i \\ge 0 ~ (i \\ne k)$ (they may be $\\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:\n\n    $$ | A_k | = \\binom{16}{5} $$\n\n    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \\ne p$) is equal to:\n\n    $$ \\left| A_k \\cap A_p \\right| = \\binom{7}{5}$$\n\n    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.\n\n    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:\n\n    $$\\binom{25}{5} - \\left(\\binom{6}{1} \\cdot \\binom{16}{5} - \\binom{6}{2} \\cdot \\binom{7}{5}\\right) $$\n\n    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval\n\n    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).\n\n    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.\n\n    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\\cdots k)$.\n\n    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:\n\n    $$ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{ r }{ p_i } \\right\\rfloor $$\n\n    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.\n\n    Here is a C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int solve (int n, int r) {\n    \tvector<int> p;\n    \tfor (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)\n    \t\tif (n % i == 0) {\n    \t\t\tp.push_back (i);\n    \t\t\twhile (n % i == 0)\n    \t\t\t\tn /= i;\n    \t\t}\n    \tif (n > 1)\n    \t\tp.push_back (n);\n\n    \tint sum = 0;\n    \tfor (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {\n    \t\tint mult = 1,\n    \t\t\tbits = 0;\n    \t\tfor (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)\n    \t\t\tif (msk & (1<<i)) {\n    \t\t\t\t++bits;\n    \t\t\t\tmult *= p[i];\n    \t\t\t}\n\n    \t\tint cur = r / mult;\n    \t\tif (bits % 2 == 1)\n    \t\t\tsum += cur;\n    \t\telse\n    \t\t\tsum -= cur;\n    \t}\n\n    \treturn r - sum;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The Perrin sequence is defined as follows: P(0) = 3, P(1) = 0, P(2) = 2, and for n >= 3, P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3). The function should return the sum of the first `n` Perrin numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will first generate the Perrin numbers up to the `n`-th term.
