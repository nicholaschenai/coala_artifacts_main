    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple containing elements that are present in either of the input tuples but not in both. This means we want to find the unique elements from both tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Convert both tuples into sets to eliminate duplicates and allow for easy comparison.\n   - Use set operations to find elements that are in one set but not in the other.\n   - Combine the results from both sets to get the final list of dissimilar elements.\n   - Convert the resulting set back into a tuple before returning it.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n       convert tuple1 to set1\n       convert tuple2 to set2\n       find elements in set1 that are not in set2\n       find elements in set2 that are not in set1\n       combine both results\n       convert the combined result to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Convert tuples to sets to eliminate duplicates\n    set1 = set(tuple1)\n    set2 = set(tuple2)\n    \n    # Find elements in set1 that are not in set2\n    dissimilar_from_set1 = set1 - set2\n    \n    # Find elements in set2 that are not in set1\n    dissimilar_from_set2 = set2 - set1\n    \n    # Combine both results\n    combined_dissimilar = dissimilar_from_set1.union(dissimilar_from_set2)\n    \n    # Convert the combined result to a tuple and return\n    return tuple(combined_dissimilar)\n```",
