    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes two tuples of equal length and computes the modulo of each corresponding pair of elements from the two tuples. The result should be a new tuple containing the results of these modulo operations.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we will iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously. For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will compute the modulo of the first element by the second element. We will store these results in a new tuple, which we will return at the end.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):\n       create an empty list to store results\n       for each index i from 0 to length of tuple1:\n           result = tuple1[i] % tuple2[i]\n           append result to the results list\n       convert results list to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Create an empty list to store results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the elements of both tuples\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Compute the modulo of the first tuple's element by the second tuple's element\n        result = tuple1[i] % tuple2[i]\n        # Append the result to the results list\n        results.append(result)\n    \n    # Convert the results list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(results)\n```",
