INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/616 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples of the same length and computes the modulo of each corresponding pair of elements from the two tuples. The result should be a new tuple containing the results of these modulo operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Iterate through both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will calculate the modulo of the first element by the second.
   - We will collect these results into a new tuple and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):
       create an empty list to store results

    Title: Binomial Coefficients
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    ### Binomial coefficient modulo prime power  { #mod-prime-pow}

    Here we want to compute the binomial coefficient modulo some prime power, i.e. $m = p^b$ for some prime $p$.
    If $p > \max(k, n-k)$, then we can use the same method as described in the previous section.
    But if $p \le \max(k, n-k)$, then at least one of $k!$ and $(n-k)!$ are not coprime with $m$, and therefore we cannot compute the inverses - they don't exist.
    Nevertheless we can compute the binomial coefficient.

    The idea is the following:
    We compute for each $x!$ the biggest exponent $c$ such that $p^c$ divides $x!$, i.e. $p^c ~|~ x!$.
    Let $c(x)$ be that number.
    And let $g(x) := \frac{x!}{p^{c(x)}}$.
    Then we can write the binomial coefficient as:

    $$\binom n k = \frac {g(n) p^{c(n)}} {g(k) p^{c(k)} g(n-k) p^{c(n-k)}} = \frac {g(n)} {g(k) g(n-k)}p^{c(n) - c(k) - c(n-k)}$$

    The interesting thing is, that $g(x)$ is now free from the prime divisor $p$.
    Therefore $g(x)$ is coprime to m, and we can compute the modular inverses of $g(k)$ and $g(n-k)$.

    After precomputing all values for $g$ and $c$, which can be done efficiently using dynamic programming in $\mathcal{O}(n)$, we can compute the binomial coefficient in $O(\log m)$ time.
    Or precompute all inverses and all powers of $p$, and then compute the binomial coefficient in $O(1)$.

    Notice, if $c(n) - c(k) - c(n-k) \ge b$, than $p^b ~|~ p^{c(n) - c(k) - c(n-k)}$, and the binomial coefficient is $0$.

    ### Binomial coefficient modulo an arbitrary number

    Now we compute the binomial coefficient modulo some arbitrary modulus $m$.

    Let the prime factorization of $m$ be $m = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_h^{e_h}$.
    We can compute the binomial coefficient modulo $p_i^{e_i}$ for every $i$.
    This gives us $h$ different congruences.
    Since all moduli $p_i^{e_i}$ are coprime, we can apply the [Chinese Remainder Theorem](../algebra/chinese-remainder-theorem.md) to compute the binomial coefficient modulo the product of the moduli, which is the desired binomial coefficient modulo $m$.

    ### Binomial coefficient for large $n$ and small modulo {data-toc-label="Binomial coefficient for large n and small modulo"}

    When $n$ is too large, the $\mathcal{O}(n)$ algorithms discussed above become impractical. However, if the modulo $m$ is small there are still ways to calculate $\binom{n}{k} \bmod m$.

    When the modulo $m$ is prime, there are 2 options:

    * [Lucas's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas's_theorem) can be applied which breaks the problem of computing $\binom{n}{k} \bmod m$ into $\log_m n$ problems of the form $\binom{x_i}{y_i} \bmod m$ where $x_i, y_i < m$.  If each reduced coefficient is calculated using precomputed factorials and inverse factorials, the complexity is $\mathcal{O}(m + \log_m n)$.
    * The method of computing [factorial modulo P](../algebra/factorial-modulo.md) can be used to get the required $g$ and $c$ values and use them as described in the section of [modulo prime power](#mod-prime-pow). This takes $\mathcal{O}(m \log_m n)$.

    When $m$ is not prime but square-free, the prime factors of $m$ can be obtained and the coefficient modulo each prime factor can be calculated using either of the above methods, and the overall answer can be obtained by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

    When $m$ is not square-free, a [generalization of Lucas's theorem for prime powers](https://web.archive.org/web/20170202003812/http://www.dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/PDF/BinCoeff.pdf) can be applied instead of Lucas's theorem.

    Part: 2/2

    ## Solution for not coprime moduli

    As mentioned, the algorithm above only works for coprime moduli $m_1, m_2, \dots m_k$.

    In the not coprime case, a system of congruences has exactly one solution modulo $\text{lcm}(m_1, m_2, \dots, m_k)$, or has no solution at all.

    E.g. in the following system, the first congruence implies that the solution is odd, and the second congruence implies that the solution is even.
    It's not possible that a number is both odd and even, therefore there is clearly no solution.

    $$\left\{\begin{align}
        a & \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\
        a & \equiv 2 \pmod{6}
    \end{align}\right.$$

    It is pretty simple to determine is a system has a solution.
    And if it has one, we can use the original algorithm to solve a slightly modified system of congruences.

    A single congruence $a \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i}$ is equivalent to the system of congruences $a \equiv a_i \pmod{p_j^{n_j}}$ where $p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2}\cdots p_k^{n_k}$ is the prime factorization of $m_i$.

    With this fact, we can modify the system of congruences into a system, that only has prime powers as moduli.
    E.g. the above system of congruences is equivalent to:

    $$\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
        a \equiv 1          & \pmod{4} \\
        a \equiv 2 \equiv 0 & \pmod{2} \\
        a \equiv 2          & \pmod{3}
    \end{array}\right.$$

    Because originally some moduli had common factors, we will get some congruences moduli based on the same prime, however possibly with different prime powers.

    You can observe, that the congruence with the highest prime power modulus will be the strongest congruence of all congruences based on the same prime number.
    Either it will give a contradiction with some other congruence, or it will imply already all other congruences.

    In our case, the first congruence $a \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ implies $a \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$, and therefore contradicts the second congruence $a \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$.
    Therefore this system of congruences has no solution.

    If there are no contradictions, then the system of equation has a solution.
    We can ignore all congruences except the ones with the highest prime power moduli.
    These moduli are now coprime, and therefore we can solve this one with the algorithm discussed in the sections above.

    E.g. the following system has a solution modulo $\text{lcm}(10, 12) = 60$.

    $$\left\{\begin{align}
        a & \equiv 3 \pmod{10} \\
        a & \equiv 5 \pmod{12}
    \end{align}\right.$$

    The system of congruence is equivalent to the system of congruences:

    $$\left\{\begin{align}
        a & \equiv 3 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \\
        a & \equiv 3 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \\
        a & \equiv 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\
        a & \equiv 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}
    \end{align}\right.$$

    The only congruence with same prime modulo are $a \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ and $a \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$.
    The first one already implies the second one, so we can ignore the second one, and solve the following system with coprime moduli instead:

    $$\left\{\begin{align}
        a & \equiv 3 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \\
        a & \equiv 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \\
        a & \equiv 5 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}
    \end{align}\right.$$

    It has the solution $53 \pmod{60}$, and indeed $53 \bmod{10} = 3$ and $53 \bmod{12} = 5$.

    ## Garner's Algorithm

    Another consequence of the CRT is that we can represent big numbers using an array of small integers.

    Instead of doing a lot of computations with very large numbers numbers, which might be expensive (think of doing divisions with 1000-digit numbers), you can pick a couple of coprime moduli and represent the large number as a system of congruences, and perform all operations on the system of equations.
    Any number $a$ less than $m_1 m_2 \cdots m_k$ can be represented as an array $a_1, \ldots, a_k$, where $a \equiv a_i \pmod{m_i}$.

    By using the above algorithm, you can again reconstruct the large number whenever you need it.

    Alternatively you can represent the number in the **mixed radix** representation:

    $$a = x_1 + x_2 m_1 + x_3 m_1 m_2 + \ldots + x_k m_1 \cdots m_{k-1} \text{ with }x_i \in [0, m_i)$$

    Garner's algorithm, which is discussed in the dedicated article [Garner's algorithm](garners-algorithm.md), computes the coefficients $x_i$.
    And with those coefficients you can restore the full number.

[Textbook Reference Material]:
    Title: Operations on polynomials and series
    Part: 3/4
    Let $F(Q_k) \equiv 0 \pmod{x^{a}}$. We need to find $Q_{k+1} \equiv Q_k + x^a C \pmod{x^{2a}}$ such that $F(Q_{k+1}) \equiv 0 \pmod{x^{2a}}$.

    Substituting $x = Q_{k+1}$ and $y=Q_k$ in the formula above, we get

    $$F(Q_{k+1}) \equiv F(Q_k) + (Q_{k+1} - Q_k) F'(Q_k) + (Q_{k+1} - Q_k)^2 G(x, y) \pmod x^{2a}.$$

    Since $Q_{k+1} - Q_k \equiv 0 \pmod{x^a}$, it also holds that $(Q_{k+1} - Q_k)^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{x^{2a}}$, thus

    $$0 \equiv F(Q_{k+1}) \equiv F(Q_k) + (Q_{k+1} - Q_k) F'(Q_k) \pmod{x^{2a}}.$$

    The last formula gives us the value of $Q_{k+1}$:

    $$\boxed{Q_{k+1} = Q_k - \dfrac{F(Q_k)}{F'(Q_k)} \pmod{x^{2a}}}$$

    Thus, knowing how to invert polynomials and how to compute $F(Q_k)$, we can find $n$ coefficients of $P$ with the complexity

    $$T(n) = T(n/2) + f(n),$$

    where $f(n)$ is the time needed to compute $F(Q_k)$ and $F'(Q_k)^{-1}$ which is usually $O(n \log n)$.

    The iterative rule above is known in numerical analysis as [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method).

    #### Hensel's lemma

    As was mentioned earlier, formally and generically this result is known as [Hensel's lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hensel%27s_lemma) and it may in fact used in even broader sense when we work with a series of nested rings. In this particular case we worked with a sequence of polynomial remainders modulo $x$, $x^2$, $x^3$ and so on.

    Another example where Hensel's lifting might be helpful are so-called [p-adic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number) where we, in fact, work with the sequence of integer remainders modulo $p$, $p^2$, $p^3$ and so on. For example, Newton's method can be used to find all possible [automorphic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphic_number) (numbers that end on itself when squared) with a given number base. The problem is left as an exercise to the reader. You might consider [this](https://acm.timus.ru/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1698) problem to check if your solution works for $10$-based numbers.


    ### Logarithm

    For the function $\ln P(x)$ it's known that: 

    $$
    \boxed{(\ln P(x))' = \dfrac{P'(x)}{P(x)}}
    $$

    Thus we can calculate $n$ coefficients of $\ln P(x)$ in $O(n \log n)$.


    ### Inverse series

    Turns out, we can get the formula for $A^{-1}$ using Newton's method.
    For this we take the equation $A=Q^{-1}$, thus:

    $$F(Q) = Q^{-1} - A$$

    $$F'(Q) = -Q^{-2}$$

    $$\boxed{Q_{k+1} \equiv Q_k(2-AQ_k) \pmod{x^{2^{k+1}}}}$$

    ### Exponent

    Let's learn to calculate $e^{P(x)}=Q(x)$. It should hold that $\ln Q = P$, thus:

    $$F(Q) = \ln Q - P$$

    $$F'(Q) = Q^{-1}$$

    $$\boxed{Q_{k+1} \equiv Q_k(1 + P - \ln Q_k) \pmod{x^{2^{k+1}}}}$$

    ### $k$-th power { data-toc-label="k-th power" }

    Now we need to calculate $P^k(x)=Q$. This may be done via the following formula:

    $$Q = \exp\left[k \ln P(x)\right]$$

    Note though, that you can calculate the logarithms and the exponents correctly only if you can find some initial $Q_0$.

    To find it, you should calculate the logarithm or the exponent of the constant coefficient of the polynomial.

    But the only reasonable way to do it is if $P(0)=1$ for $Q = \ln P$ so $Q(0)=0$ and if $P(0)=0$ for $Q = e^P$ so $Q(0)=1$.

    Thus you can use formula above only if $P(0) = 1$. Otherwise if $P(x) = \alpha x^t T(x)$ where $T(0)=1$ you can write that:

    $$\boxed{P^k(x) = \alpha^kx^{kt} \exp[k \ln T(x)]}$$

    Note that you also can calculate some $k$-th root of a polynomial if you can calculate $\sqrt[k]{\alpha}$, for example for $\alpha=1$.

    ## Evaluation and Interpolation

    ### Chirp-z Transform

    For the particular case when you need to evaluate a polynomial in the points $x_r = z^{2r}$ you can do the following:

    $$A(z^{2r}) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^n a_k z^{2kr}$$

    Let's substitute $2kr = r^2+k^2-(r-k)^2$. Then this sum rewrites as:

    $$\boxed{A(z^{2r}) = z^{r^2}\sum\limits_{k=0}^n (a_k z^{k^2}) z^{-(r-k)^2}}$$

    Which is up to the factor $z^{r^2}$ equal to the convolution of the sequences $u_k = a_k z^{k^2}$ and $v_k = z^{-k^2}$.

    Note that $u_k$ has indexes from $0$ to $n$ here and $v_k$ has indexes from $-n$ to $m$ where $m$ is the maximum power of $z$ which you need.

    Now if you need to evaluate a polynomial in the points $x_r = z^{2r+1}$ you can reduce it to the previous task by the transformation $a_k \to a_k z^k$.

    It gives us an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm when you need to compute values in powers of $z$, thus you may compute the DFT for non-powers of two.

    Another observation is that $kr = \binom{k+r}{2} - \binom{k}{2} - \binom{r}{2}$. Then we have

    $$\boxed{A(z^r) = z^{-\binom{r}{2}}\sum\limits_{k=0}^n \left(a_k z^{-\binom{k}{2}}\right)z^{\binom{k+r}{2}}}$$

    The coefficient of $x^{n+r}$ of the product of the polynomials $A_0(x) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^n a_{n-k}z^{-\binom{n-k}{2}}x^k$ and $A_1(x) = \sum\limits_{k\geq 0}z^{\binom{k}{2}}x^k$ equals $z^{\binom{r}{2}}A(z^r)$. You can use the formula $z^{\binom{k+1}{2}}=z^{\binom{k}{2}+k}$ to calculate the coefficients of $A_0(x)$ and $A_1(x)$.

    ### Multi-point Evaluation
    Assume you need to calculate $A(x_1), \dots, A(x_n)$. As mentioned earlier, $A(x) \equiv A(x_i) \pmod{x-x_i}$. Thus you may do the following:

    1. Compute a segment tree such that in the segment $[l,r)$ stands the product $P_{l, r}(x) = (x-x_l)(x-x_{l+1})\dots(x-x_{r-1})$.
    2. Starting with $l=1$ and $r=n+1$ at the root node. Let $m=\lfloor(l+r)/2\rfloor$. Let's move down to $[l,m)$ with the polynomial $A(x) \pmod{P_{l,m}(x)}$.
    3. This will recursively compute $A(x_l), \dots, A(x_{m-1})$, now do the same for $[m,r)$ with $A(x) \pmod{P_{m,r}(x)}$.
    4. Concatenate the results from the first and second recursive call and return them.

    The whole procedure will run in $O(n \log^2 n)$.

    ### Interpolation

    There's a direct formula by Lagrange to interpolate a polynomial, given set of pairs $(x_i, y_i)$:

    $$\boxed{A(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n y_i \prod\limits_{j \neq i}\dfrac{x-x_j}{x_i - x_j}}$$

    Computing it directly is a hard thing but turns out, we may compute it in $O(n \log^2 n)$ with a divide and conquer approach:

    Consider $P(x) = (x-x_1)\dots(x-x_n)$. To know the coefficients of the denominators in $A(x)$ we should compute products like: 

    $$
    P_i = \prod\limits_{j \neq i} (x_i-x_j)
    $$

    But if you consider the derivative $P'(x)$ you'll find out that $P'(x_i) = P_i$. Thus you can compute $P_i$'s via evaluation in $O(n \log^2 n)$.

    Now consider the recursive algorithm done on same segment tree as in the multi-point evaluation. It starts in the leaves with the value $\dfrac{y_i}{P_i}$ in each leaf.

    When we return from the recursion we should merge the results from the left and the right vertices as $A_{l,r} = A_{l,m}P_{m,r} + P_{l,m} A_{m,r}$.

    In this way when you return back to the root you'll have exactly $A(x)$ in it.
    The total procedure also works in $O(n \log^2 n)$.

    ## GCD and Resultants

    Assume you're given polynomials $A(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^n$ and $B(x) = b_0 + b_1 x + \dots + b_m x^m$.

    Let $\lambda_0, \dots, \lambda_n$ be the roots of $A(x)$ and let $\mu_0, \dots, \mu_m$ be the roots of $B(x)$ counted with their multiplicities.

    You want to know if $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ have any roots in common. There are two interconnected ways to do that.

    ### Euclidean algorithm

    Well, we already have an [article](euclid-algorithm.md) about it. For an arbitrary  domain you can write the Euclidean algorithm as easy as:

    ```cpp
    template<typename T>
    T gcd(const T &a, const T &b) {
    	return b == T(0) ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/616 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes two tuples of equal length and computes the modulo of each corresponding pair of elements from the two tuples. The result should be a new tuple containing the results of these modulo operations.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we will iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously. For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will compute the modulo of the first element by the second element. We will store these results in a new tuple, which we will return at the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):
       create an empty list to store results
       for each index i from 0 to length of tuple1:
           result = tuple1[i] % tuple2[i]
           append result to the results list
       convert results list to a tuple
       return the tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def tuple_modulo(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Create an empty list to store results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through the elements of both tuples
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):

        result = tuple1[i] % tuple2[i]
        # Append the result to the results list
        results.append(result)
    
    # Convert the results list to a tuple and return it
