    "raw_msg": "Let's analyze the situation again, taking into account the correct understanding of star numbers and the previous mistakes.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the n-th star number, and for the input of 3, the expected output is 37.\n\n2. **Identifying the Correct Formula**: The star numbers can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   S_n = \\frac{n(6n - 6 + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   This formula can be simplified to:\n   \\[\n   S_n = \\frac{n(3n - 2)}{2}\n   \\]\n   However, this still does not yield the correct star numbers.\n\n3. **Finding the Correct Sequence**: The correct formula for the n-th star number is:\n   \\[\n   S_n = n(2n - 1)\n   \\]\n   This formula generates the sequence of star numbers correctly.\n\n4. **Where I Went Wrong**: I mistakenly used an incorrect formula for calculating the star numbers. The formula I provided did not yield the correct results, as evidenced by the failure of the test case.\n\n5. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula for the n-th star number is:\n   \\[\n   S_n = n(2n - 1)\n   \\]\n   This formula correctly generates the star numbers.\n\nNow, I will implement the correct formula in the function to ensure it returns the expected results. \n\nHere\u2019s the corrected implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_star_num(n):\n    # Calculate the n-th star number using the correct formula\n    star_number = n * (2 * n - 1)\n    return star_number\n```",
