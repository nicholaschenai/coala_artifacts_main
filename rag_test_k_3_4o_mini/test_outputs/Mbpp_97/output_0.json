    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (a 2D list) and counts how many times each unique element appears across all the lists. The result should be returned as a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements and the values are their respective counts.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each sublist in the main list, and then through each element in those sublists. We will maintain a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each element. If an element is already in the dictionary, we will increment its count; if it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, we will return the dictionary.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function frequency_lists(lists):\n       create an empty dictionary called frequency\n       for each sublist in lists:\n           for each element in sublist:\n               if element is in frequency:\n                   increment frequency[element] by 1\n               else:\n                   set frequency[element] to 1\n       return frequency\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef frequency_lists(lists):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element\n    frequency = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the main list\n    for sublist in lists:\n        # Iterate through each element in the current sublist\n        for element in sublist:\n            # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n            if element in frequency:\n                frequency[element] += 1\n            # If the element is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n            else:\n                frequency[element] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing the frequency of each element\n    return frequency\n```",
