Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm\n    Part: 3/4\n    ```\n\n    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\\pi$, and then compute the final answers:\n    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.\n    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.\n\n    Now let us consider the second problem.\n    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:\n    we create the string $s + \\# + t$ and compute its prefix function.\n    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\\pi[i]$ for $i \\ge n + 1$.\n    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.\n\n    ### The number of different substring in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.\n\n    We will solve this problem iteratively.\n    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.\n\n    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.\n    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.\n    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.\n\n    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.\n    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.\n    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ long.\n    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.\n\n    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \\pi_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.\n\n    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.\n\n    ### Compressing a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to find the shortest \"compressed\" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.\n\n    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.\n    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \\pi[n - 1]$.\n    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.\n\n    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.\n    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.\n    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.\n    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.\n    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.\n    And so on.\n    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.\n\n    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.\n    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.\n    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.\n\n    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.\n    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.\n    We prove it by contradiction.\n    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).\n    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.\n    Now consider the second block of the string.\n    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.\n    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.\n    Contradiction.\n\n    $$\\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \\overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$\n\n    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\\pi[7] = 5}$$\n\n    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \\Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$\n\n    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function\n\n    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \\# + t$.\n    Obviously, since $\\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.\n    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \\#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:\n\n    $$\\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \\dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \\#}_{\\text{need to store}} ~ \\underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \\dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\\text{do not need to store}}$$\n\n    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \\in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.\n\n    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.\n\n    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\\text{old}_\\pi, c) \\rightarrow \\text{new}_\\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                int j = i;\n                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])\n                    j = pi[j-1];\n                if ('a' + c == s[j])\n                    j++;\n                aut[i][c] = j;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.\n    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.\n    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])\n                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];\n                else\n                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Data structures\n    Section: Comparison to sorting\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Comparison to sorting}\n\n    It is often possible to solve a problem\n    using either data structures or sorting.\n    Sometimes there are remarkable differences\n    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,\n    which may be hidden in their time complexities.\n\n    Let us consider a problem where\n    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$\n    that both contain $n$ elements.\n    Our task is to calculate the number of elements\n    that belong to both of the lists.\n    For example, for the lists\n    \\[A = [5,2,8,9] \\hspace{10px} \\textrm{and} \\hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\\]\n    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5\n    and 9 belong to both of the lists.\n\n    A straightforward solution to the problem is\n    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,\n    but next we will focus on\n    more efficient algorithms.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,\n    and after this, we iterate through the elements\n    of $B$ and check for each elements if it\n    also belongs to $A$.\n    This is efficient because the elements of $A$\n    are in a set.\n    Using the \\texttt{set} structure,\n    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,\n    so instead of the \\texttt{set} structure\n    we can also use the \\texttt{unordered\\_set} structure.\n    This is an easy way to make the algorithm\n    more efficient, because we only have to change\n    the underlying data structure.\n    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 3}\n\n    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.\n    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.\n    After this, we iterate through both the lists\n    at the same time and find the common elements.\n    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,\n    so the total time complexity is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    The following table shows how efficient\n    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and\n    the elements of the lists are random\n    integers between $1 \\ldots 10^9$:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\\\\n    $2 \\cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\\\\n    $3 \\cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\\\\n    $4 \\cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\\\\n    $5 \\cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that\n    they use different set structures.\n    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on\n    the running time, because Algorithm 2\n    is 4\u20135 times faster than Algorithm 1.\n\n    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3\n    which uses sorting.\n    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.\n    Interestingly, the time complexity of both\n    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.\n    This can be explained by the fact that\n    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done\n    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.\n    On the other hand,\n    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree\n    during the whole algorithm.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Dynamic programming\n    Section: Counting tilings\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Counting tilings}\n\n    Sometimes the states of a dynamic programming solution\n    are more complex than fixed combinations of numbers.\n    As an example,\n    consider the problem of calculating\n    the number of distinct ways to\n    fill an $n \\times m$ grid using\n    $1 \\times 2$ and $2 \\times 1$ size tiles.\n    For example, one valid solution\n    for the $4 \\times 7$ grid is\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.65]\n        \\draw (0,0) grid (7,4);\n        \\draw[fill=gray] (0+0.2,0+0.2) rectangle (2-0.2,1-0.2);\n

\\draw[fill=gray] (4+0.2,3+0.2) rectangle (6-0.2,4-0.2);\n\n        \\draw[fill=gray] (0+0.2,2+0.2) rectangle (1-0.2,4-0.2);\n        \\draw[fill=gray] (3+0.2,2+0.2) rectangle (4-0.2,4-0.2);\n

\\draw[fill=gray] (6+0.2,0+0.2) rectangle (7-0.2,2-0.2);\n\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    and the total number of solutions is 781.\n\n    The problem can be solved using dynamic programming\n    by going through the grid row by row.\n    Each row in a solution can be represented as a\n    string that contains $m$ characters from the set\n    $\\{\\sqcap, \\sqcup, \\sqsubset, \\sqsupset \\}$.\n    For example, the above solution consists of four rows\n    that correspond to the following strings:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item\n    $\\sqcap \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcap \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcap$\n    \\item\n    $\\sqcup \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup \\sqcap \\sqcap \\sqcup$\n    \\item\n    $\\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup \\sqcup \\sqcap$ \n    \\item\n    $\\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup$\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    Let $\\texttt{count}(k,x)$ denote the number of ways to\n    construct a solution for rows $1 \\ldots k$\n    of the grid such that string $x$ corresponds to row $k$.\n    It is possible to use dynamic programming here,\n    because the state of a row is constrained\n    only by the state of the previous row.\n\n    A solution is valid if row $1$ does not contain\n    the character $\\sqcup$,\n    row $n$ does not contain the character $\\sqcap$,\n    and all consecutive rows are \\emph{compatible}.\n    For example, the rows\n    $\\sqcup \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup \\sqcap \\sqcap \\sqcup$ and\n    $\\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup \\sqcup \\sqcap$ \n    are compatible, while the rows\n    $\\sqcap \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcap \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcap$ and\n    $\\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup$\n    are not compatible.\n\n    Since a row consists of $m$ characters and there are\n    four choices for each character, the number of distinct\n    rows is at most $4^m$.\n    Thus, the time complexity of the solution is\n    $O(n 4^{2m})$ because we can go through the\n    $O(4^m)$ possible states for each row,\n    and for each state, there are $O(4^m)$\n    possible states for the previous row.\n    In practice, it is a good idea to rotate the grid\n    so that the shorter side has length $m$,\n    because the factor $4^{2m}$ dominates the time complexity.\n\n    It is possible to make the solution more efficient\n    by using a more compact representation for the rows.\n    It turns out that it is sufficient to know which\n    columns of the previous row contain the upper square\n    of a vertical tile.\n    Thus, we can represent a row using only characters\n    $\\sqcap$ and $\\Box$, where $\\Box$ is a combination\n    of characters\n    $\\sqcup$, $\\sqsubset$ and $\\sqsupset$.\n    Using this representation, there are only\n    $2^m$ distinct rows and the time complexity is\n    $O(n 2^{2m})$.\n\n    As a final note, there is also a surprising direct formula\n    for calculating the number of tilings\\footnote{Surprisingly,\n    this formula was discovered in 1961 by two research teams \\cite{kas61,tem61}\n    that worked independently.}:\n    \\[ \\prod_{a=1}^{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil} \\prod_{b=1}^{\\lceil m/2 \\rceil} 4 \\cdot (\\cos^2 \\frac{\\pi a}{n + 1} + \\cos^2 \\frac{\\pi b}{m+1})\\]\n    This formula is very efficient, because it calculates\n    the number of tilings in $O(nm)$ time,\n    but since the answer is a product of real numbers,\n    a problem when using the formula is\n    how to store the intermediate results accurately.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
