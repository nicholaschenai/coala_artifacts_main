INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/629 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the input list, check if it is even (a number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder), and if it is, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing only the even numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function Split(numbers):
       create an empty list called even_numbers
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is even:
               add number to even_numbers
       return even_numbers

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. 

    \subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \subsubsection{Euler's totient function}

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.
