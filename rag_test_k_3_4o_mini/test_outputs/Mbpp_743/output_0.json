    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list and a number as inputs, and rotates the list to the right by the specified number of positions. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the number is `2`, the output should be `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To rotate the list to the right, we can determine the effective number of positions to rotate by using the modulo operation with the length of the list. This is because rotating a list by its length results in the same list. After determining the effective rotation, we can slice the list into two parts: the last `k` elements and the rest of the list. We then concatenate these two parts to get the rotated list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function rotate_right(lst, k):\n       n = length of lst\n       if n is 0:\n           return lst\n       k = k % n  // effective rotation\n       return lst[-k:] + lst[:-k]  // concatenate last k elements with the rest\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef rotate_right(lst, k):\n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(lst)\n    \n    # If the list is empty, return it as is\n    if n == 0:\n        return lst\n    \n    # Calculate effective rotation\n    k = k % n\n    \n    # Return the concatenated result of the last k elements and the rest of the list\n    return lst[-k:] + lst[:-k]\n```",
