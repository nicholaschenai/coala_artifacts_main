    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and finds the difference between the first even number and the first odd number in that list. If the first even number is found before the first odd number, we subtract the odd number from the even number. If the first odd number is found first, we subtract the even number from the odd number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the list of numbers.\n   - We will keep track of the first even and first odd numbers we encounter.\n   - Once we find both, we will calculate the difference based on which one was found first.\n   - If we finish iterating through the list without finding either an even or an odd number, we will handle that case appropriately.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function diff_even_odd(numbers):\n       initialize first_even to None\n       initialize first_odd to None\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even and first_even is None:\n               set first_even to number\n           if number is odd and first_odd is None:\n               set first_odd to number\n           \n           if both first_even and first_odd are found:\n               break\n       \n       if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n           if first_even was found first:\n               return first_even - first_odd\n           else:\n               return first_odd - first_even\n       else:\n           return None  # or some indication that one of them was not found\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef diff_even_odd(numbers):\n    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers\n    first_even = None\n    first_odd = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of numbers\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0 and first_even is None:\n            first_even = number  # Store the first even number\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0 and first_odd is None:\n            first_odd = number  # Store the first odd number\n        \n        # If both first_even and first_odd are found, we can stop searching\n        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # Calculate the difference based on which was found first\n    if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n        if numbers.index(first_even) < numbers.index(first_odd):\n            return first_even - first_odd  # Even found first\n        else:\n            return first_odd - first_even  # Odd found first\n    else:\n        return None  # Indicate that one of them was not found\n```",
