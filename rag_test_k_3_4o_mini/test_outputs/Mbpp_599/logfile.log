INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/599 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum and average of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should return these two values as a tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, we can use the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. The average can be calculated by dividing the sum by `n`. Finally, we will return both the sum and the average as a tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function sum_average(n):
       Calculate sum using the formula n * (n + 1) / 2
       Calculate average by dividing sum by n
       Return (sum, average) as a tuple
   ```

def sum_average(n):
    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula
    total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Using integer division for sum
    # Calculate the average
    average = total_sum / n  # Average is the sum divided by n
    # Return the sum and average as a tuple
    return (total_sum, average)

    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Minimizing sums
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.

    Chapter: Introduction
    Section: Mathematics
    Part: 1/2
    \section{Mathematics}

    Mathematics plays an important role in competitive
    programming, and it is not possible to become
    a successful competitive programmer without
    having good mathematical skills.
    This section discusses some important
    mathematical concepts and formulas that
    are needed later in the book.

    \subsubsection{Sum formulas}

    Each sum of the form
    \[\sum_{x=1}^n x^k = 1^k+2^k+3^k+\ldots+n^k,\]
    where $k$ is a positive integer,
    has a closed-form formula that is a
    polynomial of degree $k+1$.
    For example\footnote{\index{Faulhaber's formula}
    There is even a general formula for such sums, called \key{Faulhaber's formula},
    but it is too complex to be presented here.},
    \[\sum_{x=1}^n x = 1+2+3+\ldots+n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\]
    and
    \[\sum_{x=1}^n x^2 = 1^2+2^2+3^2+\ldots+n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.\]

    An \key{arithmetic progression} is a \index{arithmetic progression}
    sequence of numbers
    where the difference between any two consecutive
    numbers is constant.
    For example,
    \[3, 7, 11, 15\]
    is an arithmetic progression with constant 4.
    The sum of an arithmetic progression can be calculated
    using the formula
    \[\underbrace{a + \cdots + b}_{n \,\, \textrm{numbers}} = \frac{n(a+b)}{2}\]
    where $a$ is the first number,
    $b$ is the last number and
    $n$ is the amount of numbers.
    For example,
    \[3+7+11+15=\frac{4 \cdot (3+15)}{2} = 36.\]
    The formula is based on the fact
    that the sum consists of $n$ numbers and
    the value of each number is $(a+b)/2$ on average.

    \index{geometric progression}
    A \key{geometric progression} is a sequence
    of numbers
    where the ratio between any two consecutive
    numbers is constant.
    For example,
    \[3,6,12,24\]
    is a geometric progression with constant 2.
    The sum of a geometric progression can be calculated
    using the formula
    \[a + ak + ak^2 + \cdots + b = \frac{bk-a}{k-1}\]
    where $a$ is the first number,
    $b$ is the last number and the
    ratio between consecutive numbers is $k$.
    For example,
    \[3+6+12+24=\frac{24 \cdot 2 - 3}{2-1} = 45.\]

    This formula can be derived as follows. Let
    \[ S = a + ak + ak^2 + \cdots + b .\]
    By multiplying both sides by $k$, we get
    \[ kS = ak + ak^2 + ak^3 + \cdots + bk,\]
    and solving the equation
    \[ kS-S = bk-a\]
    yields the formula.

    A special case of a sum of a geometric progression is the formula
    \[1+2+4+8+\ldots+2^{n-1}=2^n-1.\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    A \key{harmonic sum} is a sum of the form
    \[ \sum_{x=1}^n \frac{1}{x} = 1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\ldots+\frac{1}{n}.\]

    An upper bound for a harmonic sum is $\log_2(n)+1$.
    Namely, we can
    modify each term $1/k$ so that $k$ becomes
    the nearest power of two that does not exceed $k$.
    For example, when $n=6$, we can estimate
    the sum as follows:
    \[ 1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{6} \le
    1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}.\]
    This upper bound consists of $\log_2(n)+1$ parts
    ($1$, $2 \cdot 1/2$, $4 \cdot 1/4$, etc.),
    and the value of each part is at most 1.

    \subsubsection{Set theory}

    \index{set theory}
    \index{set}
    \index{intersection}
    \index{union}
    \index{difference}
    \index{subset}
    \index{universal set}
    \index{complement}

    A \key{set} is a collection of elements.
    For example, the set
    \[X=\{2,4,7\}\]
    contains elements 2, 4 and 7.
    The symbol $\emptyset$ denotes an empty set,
    and $|S|$ denotes the size of a set $S$,
    i.e., the number of elements in the set.
    For example, in the above set, $|X|=3$.

    If a set $S$ contains an element $x$,
    we write $x \in S$,
    and otherwise we write $x \notin S$.
    For example, in the above set
    \[4 \in X \hspace{10px}\textrm{and}\hspace{10px} 5 \notin X.\]

    \begin{samepage}
    New sets can be constructed using set operations:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The \key{intersection} $A \cap B$ consists of elements
    that are in both $A$ and $B$.
    For example, if $A=\{1,2,5\}$ and $B=\{2,4\}$,
    then $A \cap B = \{2\}$.
    \item The \key{union} $A \cup B$ consists of elements
    that are in $A$ or $B$ or both.
    For example, if $A=\{3,7\}$ and $B=\{2,3,8\}$,
    then $A \cup B = \{2,3,7,8\}$.
    \item The \key{complement} $\bar A$ consists of elements
    that are not in $A$.
    The interpretation of a complement depends on
    the \key{universal set}, which contains all possible elements.
    For example, if $A=\{1,2,5,7\}$ and the universal set is
    $\{1,2,\ldots,10\}$, then $\bar A = \{3,4,6,8,9,10\}$.
    \item The \key{difference} $A \setminus B = A \cap \bar B$
    consists of elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.
    Note that $B$ can contain elements that are not in $A$.
    For example, if $A=\{2,3,7,8\}$ and $B=\{3,5,8\}$,
    then $A \setminus B = \{2,7\}$.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{samepage}

    If each element of $A$ also belongs to $S$,
    we say that $A$ is a \key{subset} of $S$,
    denoted by $A \subset S$.
    A set $S$ always has $2^{|S|}$ subsets,
    including the empty set.
    For example, the subsets of the set $\{2,4,7\}$ are
    \begin{center}
    $\emptyset$,
    $\{2\}$, $\{4\}$, $\{7\}$, $\{2,4\}$, $\{2,7\}$, $\{4,7\}$ and $\{2,4,7\}$.
    \end{center}

    Some often used sets are
    $\mathbb{N}$ (natural numbers),
    $\mathbb{Z}$ (integers),
    $\mathbb{Q}$ (rational numbers) and
    $\mathbb{R}$ (real numbers).
    The set $\mathbb{N}$
    can be defined in two ways, depending
    on the situation:
    either $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$
    or $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,...\}$.

    We can also construct a set using a rule of the form
    \[\{f(n) : n \in S\},\]
    where $f(n)$ is some function.
    This set contains all elements of the form $f(n)$,
    where $n$ is an element in $S$.
    For example, the set
    \[X=\{2n : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}\]
    contains all even integers.

    \subsubsection{Logic}

    \index{logic}
    \index{negation}
    \index{conjuction}
    \index{disjunction}
    \index{implication}
    \index{equivalence}

    The value of a logical expression is either
    \key{true} (1) or \key{false} (0).
    The most important logical operators are
    $\lnot$ (\key{negation}),
    $\land$ (\key{conjunction}),
    $\lor$ (\key{disjunction}),
    $\Rightarrow$ (\key{implication}) and
    $\Leftrightarrow$ (\key{equivalence}).
    The following table shows the meanings of these operators:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rr|rrrrrrr}
    $A$ & $B$ & $\lnot A$ & $\lnot B$ & $A \land B$ & $A \lor B$ & $A \Rightarrow B$ & $A \Leftrightarrow B$ \\
    \hline
    0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    The expression $\lnot A$ has the opposite value of $A$.
    The expression $A \land B$ is true if both $A$ and $B$
    are true,
    and the expression $A \lor B$ is true if $A$ or $B$ or both
    are true.
    The expression $A \Rightarrow B$ is true
    if whenever $A$ is true, also $B$ is true.
    The expression $A \Leftrightarrow B$ is true
    if $A$ and $B$ are both true or both false.

    \index{predicate}

    A \key{predicate} is an expression that is true or false
    depending on its parameters.
    Predicates are usually denoted by capital letters.
    For example, we can define a predicate $P(x)$
    that is true exactly when $x$ is a prime number.
    Using this definition, $P(7)$ is true but $P(8)$ is false.

    \index{quantifier}

    A \key{quantifier} connects a logical expression
    to the elements of a set.
    The most important quantifiers are
    $\forall$ (\key{for all}) and $\exists$ (\key{there is}).
    For example,
    \[\forall x (\exists y (y < x))\]
    means that for each element $x$ in the set,
    there is an element $y$ in the set
    such that $y$ is smaller than $x$.
    This is true in the set of integers,
    but false in the set of natural numbers.

    Using the notation described above,
    we can express many kinds of logical propositions.
    For example,
    \[\forall x ((x>1 \land \lnot P(x)) \Rightarrow (\exists a (\exists b (a > 1 \land b > 1 \land x = ab))))\]
    means that if a number $x$ is larger than 1
    and not a prime number,
    then there are numbers $a$ and $b$
    that are larger than $1$ and whose product is $x$.
    This proposition is true in the set of integers.

    \subsubsection{Functions}

    The function $\lfloor x \rfloor$ rounds the number $x$
    down to an integer, and the function
    $\lceil x \rceil$ rounds the number $x

   The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula \( \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). The average can be calculated by dividing the sum by `n`. The function will take an integer `n` as input and return a tuple with the sum and average.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function sum_average(n):
       sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
       average = sum / n
       return (sum, average)
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def sum(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2  # Calculate the sum of first n natural numbers

def average(n, total_sum):
    return total_sum / n  # Calculate the average

def sum_average(n: int) -> tuple:
    total_sum = sum(n)  # Get the sum
    avg = average(n, total_sum)  # Get the average
    return (total_sum, avg)  # Return the sum and average as a tuple
```

def average(n, total_sum):
    return total_sum / n  # Calculate the average

def sum_average(n: int) -> tuple:
    total_sum = sum(n)  # Get the sum
    avg = average(n, total_sum)  # Get the average
    return (total_sum, avg)  # Return the sum and average as a tuple
