 modify each term $1/k$ so that $k$ becomes\n    the nearest power of two that does not exceed $k$.\n    For example, when $n=6$, we can estimate\n    the sum as follows:\n    \\[

parts\n    ($1$, $2 \\cdot 1/2$, $4 \\cdot 1/4$, etc.),\n    and the value of each part is at most 1.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Set theory}\n\n    \\index{set theory}\n    \\index{set}\n    \\index{intersection}\n    \\index{union}\n    \\index{difference}\n    \\index{subset}\n    \\index{universal set}\n    \\index{complement}\n\n    A \\key{set} is a collection of elements.\n    For example, the set\n    \\[X=\\{2,4,7\\}\\]\n    contains elements 2, 4 and 7.\n    The symbol $\\emptyset$ denotes an empty set,\n    and $|S|$ denotes the size of a set $S$,\n    i.e., the number of elements in the set.\n    For example, in the above set, $|X|=3$.\n\n    If a set $S$ contains an element $x$,\n    we write $x \\in S$,\n    and otherwise we write $x \\notin S$.\n    For example, in the above set\n    \\[4 \\in X \\hspace{10px}\\textrm{and}\\hspace{10px} 5 \\notin X.\\]\n\n    \\begin{samepage}\n    New sets can be constructed using set operations:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The \\key{intersection} $A \\cap B$ consists of elements\n    that are in both $A$ and $B$.\n    For example, if $A=\\{1,2,5\\}$ and $B=\\{2,4\\}$,\n    then $A \\cap B = \\{2\\}$.\n    \\item The \\key{union} $A \\cup B$ consists of elements\n    that are in $A$ or $B$ or both.\n    For example, if $A=\\{3,7\\}$ and $B=\\{2,3,8\\}$,\n    then $A \\cup B = \\{2,3,7,8\\}$.\n    \\item The \\key{complement} $\\bar A$ consists of elements\n    that are not in $A$.\n    The interpretation of a complement depends on\n    the \\key{universal set}, which contains all possible elements.\n    For example, if $A=\\{1,2,5,7\\}$ and the universal set is\n    $\\{1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$, then $\\bar A = \\{3,4,6,8,9,10\\}$.\n    \\item The \\key{difference} $A \\setminus B = A \\cap \\bar B$\n    consists of elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.\n    Note that $B$ can contain elements that are not in $A$.\n    For example, if $A=\\{2,3,7,8\\}$ and $B=\\{3,5,8\\}$,\n    then $A \\setminus B = \\{2,7\\}$.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{samepage}\n\n    If each element of $A$ also belongs to $S$,\n    we say that $A$ is a \\key{subset} of $S$,\n    denoted by $A \\subset S$.\n    A set $S$ always has $2^{|S|}$ subsets,\n    including the empty set.\n    For example, the subsets of the set $\\{2,4,7\\}$ are\n    \\begin{center}\n    $\\emptyset$,\n    $\\{2\\}$, $\\{4\\}$, $\\{7\\}$, $\\{2,4\\}$, $\\{2,7\\}$, $\\{4,7\\}$ and $\\{2,4,7\\}$.\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Some often used sets are\n    $\\mathbb{N}$ (natural numbers),\n    $\\mathbb{Z}$ (integers),\n    $\\mathbb{Q}$ (rational numbers) and\n    $\\mathbb{R}$ (real numbers).\n    The set $\\mathbb{N}$\n    can be defined in two ways, depending\n    on the situation:\n    either $\\mathbb{N}=\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$\n    or $\\mathbb{N}=\\{1,2,3,...\\}$.\n\n    We can also construct a set using a rule of the form\n    \\[\\{f(n) : n \\in S\\},\\]\n    where $f(n)$ is some function.\n    This set contains all elements of the form $f(n)$,\n    where $n$ is an element in $S$.\n    For example, the set\n    \\[X=\\{2n : n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\]\n    contains all even integers.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Logic}\n\n    \\index{logic}\n    \\index{negation}\n    \\index{conjuction}\n    \\index{disjunction}\n    \\index{implication}\n    \\index{equivalence}\n\n    The value of a logical expression is either\n    \\key{true} (1) or \\key{false} (0).\n    The most important logical operators are\n    $\\lnot$ (\\key{negation}),\n    $\\land$ (\\key{conjunction}),\n    $\\lor$ (\\key{disjunction}),\n    $\\Rightarrow$ (\\key{implication}) and\n    $\\Leftrightarrow$ (\\key{equivalence}).\n    The following table shows the meanings of these operators:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rr|rrrrrrr}\n    $A$ & $B$ & $\\lnot A$ & $\\lnot B$ & $A \\land B$ & $A \\lor B$ & $A \\Rightarrow B$ & $A \\Leftrightarrow B$ \\\\\n    \\hline\n    0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    The expression $\\lnot A$ has the opposite value of $A$.\n    The expression $A \\land B$ is true if both $A$ and $B$\n    are true,\n    and the expression $A \\lor B$ is true if $A$ or $B$ or both\n    are true.\n    The expression $A \\Rightarrow B$ is true\n    if whenever $A$ is true, also $B$ is true.\n    The expression $A \\Leftrightarrow B$ is true\n    if $A$ and $B$ are both true or both false.\n\n    \\index{predicate}\n\n    A \\key{predicate} is an expression that is true or false\n    depending on its parameters.\n    Predicates are usually denoted by capital letters.\n    For example, we can define a predicate $P(x)$\n    that is true exactly when $x$ is a prime number.\n    Using this definition, $P(7)$ is true but $P(8)$ is false.\n\n    \\index{quantifier}\n\n    A \\key{quantifier} connects a logical expression\n    to the elements of a set.\n    The most important quantifiers are\n    $\\forall$ (\\key{for all}) and $\\exists$ (\\key{there is}).\n    For example,\n    \\[\\forall x (\\exists y (y < x))\\]\n    means that for each element $x$ in the set,\n    there is an element $y$ in the set\n    such that $y$ is smaller than $x$.\n    This is true in the set of integers,\n    but false in the set of natural numbers.\n\n    Using the notation described above,\n    we can express many kinds of logical propositions.\n    For example,\n    \\[\\forall x ((x>1 \\land \\lnot P(x)) \\Rightarrow (\\exists a (\\exists b (a > 1 \\land b > 1 \\land x = ab))))\\]\n    means that if a number $x$ is larger than 1\n    and not a prime number,\n    then there are numbers $a$ and $b$\n    that are larger than $1$ and whose product is $x$.\n    This proposition is true in the set of integers.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Functions}\n\n    The function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ rounds the number $x$\n    down to an integer, and the function\n    $\\lceil x \\rceil$ rounds the number $x\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
