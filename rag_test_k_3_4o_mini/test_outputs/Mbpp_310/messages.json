Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm\n    Part: 3/4\n    ```\n\n    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\\pi$, and then compute the final answers:\n    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.\n    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.\n\n    Now let us consider the second problem.\n    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:\n    we create the string $s + \\# + t$ and compute its prefix function.\n    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\\pi[i]$ for $i \\ge n + 1$.\n    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.\n\n    ### The number of different substring in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.\n\n    We will solve this problem iteratively.\n    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.\n\n    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.\n    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.\n    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.\n\n    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.\n    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.\n    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ long.\n    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.\n\n    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \\pi_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.\n\n    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.\n\n    ### Compressing a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to find the shortest \"compressed\" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.\n\n    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.\n    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \\pi[n - 1]$.\n    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.\n\n    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.\n    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.\n    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.\n    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.\n    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.\n    And so on.\n    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.\n\n    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.\n    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.\n    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.\n\n    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.\n    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.\n    We prove it by contradiction.\n    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).\n    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.\n    Now consider the second block of the string.\n    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.\n    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.\n    Contradiction.\n\n    $$\\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \\overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$\n\n    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\\pi[7] = 5}$$\n\n    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \\Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$\n\n    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function\n\n    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \\# + t$.\n    Obviously, since $\\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.\n    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \\#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:\n\n    $$\\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \\dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \\#}_{\\text{need to store}} ~ \\underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \\dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\\text{do not need to store}}$$\n\n    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \\in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.\n\n    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.\n\n    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\\text{old}_\\pi, c) \\rightarrow \\text{new}_\\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                int j = i;\n                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])\n                    j = pi[j-1];\n                if ('a' + c == s[j])\n                    j++;\n                aut[i][c] = j;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.\n    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.\n    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])\n                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];\n                else\n                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Z-function and its calculation\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n\n    ### Comments on this implementation\n\n    The whole solution is given as a function which returns an array of length $n$ -- the Z-function of $s$.\n\n    Array $z$ is initially filled with zeros. The current rightmost match segment is assumed to be $[0; 0)$ (that is, a deliberately small segment which doesn't contain any $i$).\n\n    Inside the loop for $i = 1 \\dots n - 1$ we first determine the initial value $z[i]$ -- it will either remain zero or be computed using the above formula.\n\n    Thereafter, the trivial algorithm attempts to increase the value of $z[i]$ as much as possible.\n\n    In the end, if it's required (that is, if $i + z[i] > r$), we update the rightmost match segment $[l, r)$.\n\n    ## Asymptotic behavior of the algorithm\n\n    We will prove that the above algorithm has a running time that is linear in the length of the string -- thus, it's $O(n)$.\n\n    The proof is very simple.\n\n    We are interested in the nested `while` loop, since everything else is just a bunch of constant operations which sums up to $O(n)$.\n\n    We will show that **each iteration** of the `while` loop will increase the right border $r$ of the match segment.\n\n    To do that, we will consider both branches of the algorithm:\n\n    *   $i \\geq r$\n\n        In this case, either the `while` loop won't make any iteration (if $s[0] \\ne s[i]$), or it will take a few iterations, starting at position $i$, each time moving one character to the right. After that, the right border $r$ will necessarily be updated.\n\n        So we have found that, when $i \\geq r$, each iteration of the `while` loop increases the value of the new $r$ index.\n\n    *   $i < r$\n\n        In this case, we initialize $z[i]$ to a certain value $z_0$ given by the above formula. Let's compare this initial value $z_0$ to the value $r - i$. We will have three cases:\n\n          *   $z_0 < r - i$\n\n              We prove that in this case no iteration of the `while` loop will take place.\n\n              It's easy to prove, for example, by contradiction: if the `while` loop made at least one iteration, it would mean that initial approximation $z[i] = z_0$ was inaccurate (less than the match's actual length). But since $s[l \\dots r)$ and $s[0 \\dots r-l)$ are the same, this would imply that $z[i-l]$ holds the wrong value (less than it should be).\n\n              Thus, since $z[i-l]$ is correct and it is less than $r - i$, it follows that this value coincides with the required value $z[i]$.\n\n          *   $z_0 = r - i$\n\n              In this case, the `while` loop can make a few iterations, but each of them will lead to an increase in the value of the $r$ index because we will start comparing from $s[r]$, which will climb beyond the $[l, r)$ interval.\n\n          *   $z_0 > r - i$\n\n              This option is impossible, by definition of $z_0$.\n\n    So, we have proved that each iteration of the inner loop make the $r$ pointer advance to the right. Since $r$ can't be more than $n-1$, this means that the inner loop won't make more than $n-1$ iterations.\n\n    As the rest of the algorithm obviously works in $O(n)$, we have proved that the whole algorithm for computing Z-functions runs in linear time.\n\n    ## Applications\n\n    We will now consider some uses of Z-functions for specific tasks.\n\n    These applications will be largely similar to applications of [prefix function](prefix-function.md).\n\n    ### Search the substring\n\n    To avoid confusion, we call $t$ the **string of text**, and $p$ the **pattern**. The problem is: find all occurrences of the pattern $p$ inside the text $t$.\n\n    To solve this problem, we create a new string $s = p + \\diamond + t$, that is, we apply string concatenation to $p$ and $t$ but we also put a separator character $\\diamond$ in the middle (we'll choose $\\diamond$ so that it will certainly not be present anywhere in the strings $p$ or $t$).\n\n    Compute the Z-function for $s$. Then, for any $i$ in the interval $[0; \\; \\operatorname{length}(t) - 1]$, we will consider the corresponding value $k = z[i + \\operatorname{length}(p) + 1]$. If $k$ is equal to $\\operatorname{length}(p)$ then we know there is one occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$, otherwise there is no occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$.\n\n    The running time (and memory consumption) is $O(\\operatorname{length}(t) + \\operatorname{length}(p))$.\n\n    ### Number of distinct substrings in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$, count the number of distinct substrings of $s$.\n\n    We'll solve this problem iteratively. That is: knowing the current number of different substrings, recalculate this amount after adding to the end of $s$ one character.\n\n    So, let $k$ be the current number of distinct substrings of $s$. We append a new character $c$ to $s$. Obviously, there can be some new substrings ending in this new character $c$ (namely, all those strings that end with this symbol and that we haven't encountered yet).\n\n    Take a string $t = s + c$ and invert it (write its characters in reverse order). Our task is now to count how many prefixes of $t$ are not found anywhere else in $t$. Let's compute the Z-function of $t$ and find its maximum value $z_{max}$. Obviously, $t$'s prefix of length $z_{max}$ occurs also somewhere in the middle of $t$. Clearly, shorter prefixes also occur.\n\n    So, we have found that the number of new substrings that appear when symbol $c$ is appended to $s$ is equal to $\\operatorname{length}(t) - z_{max}$.\n\n    Consequently, the running time of this solution is $O(n^2)$ for a string of length $n$.\n\n    It's worth noting that in exactly the same way we can recalculate, still in $O(n)$ time, the number of distinct substrings when appending a character in the beginning of the string, as well as when removing it (from the end or the beginning).\n\n    ### String compression\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$. Find its shortest \"compressed\" representation, that is: find a string $t$ of shortest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    A solution is: compute the Z-function of $s$, loop through all $i$ such that $i$ divides $n$. Stop at the first $i$ such that $i + z[i] = n$. Then, the string $s$ can be compressed to the length $i$.\n\n    The proof for this fact is the same as the solution which uses the [prefix function](prefix-function.md).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Z-function and its calculation\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Z-function and its calculation\n\n    Suppose we are given a string $s$ of length $n$. The **Z-function** for this string is an array of length $n$ where the $i$-th element is equal to the greatest number of characters starting from the position $i$ that coincide with the first characters of $s$.\n\n    In other words, $z[i]$ is the length of the longest string that is, at the same time, a prefix of $s$ and a prefix of the suffix of $s$ starting at $i$.\n\n    **Note.** In this article, to avoid ambiguity, we assume $0$-based indexes; that is: the first character of $s$ has index $0$ and the last one has index $n-1$.\n\n    The first element of Z-function, $z[0]$, is generally not well defined. In this article we will assume it is zero (although it doesn't change anything in the algorithm implementation).\n\n    This article presents an algorithm for calculating the Z-function in $O(n)$ time, as well as various of its applications.\n\n    ## Examples\n\n    For example, here are the values of the Z-function computed for different strings:\n\n    * \"aaaaa\" - $[0, 4, 3, 2, 1]$\n    * \"aaabaab\" - $[0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]$\n    * \"abacaba\" - $[0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1]$\n\n    ## Trivial algorithm\n\n    Formal definition can be represented in the following elementary $O(n^2)$ implementation.\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> z_function_trivial(string s) {\n    \tint n = s.size();\n    \tvector<int> z(n);\n    \tfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n    \t\twhile (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {\n    \t\t\tz[i]++;\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    \treturn z;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We just iterate through every position $i$ and update $z[i]$ for each one of them, starting from $z[i] = 0$ and incrementing it as long as we don't find a mismatch (and as long as we don't reach the end of the line).\n\n    Of course, this is not an efficient implementation. We will now show the construction of an efficient implementation.\n\n    ## Efficient algorithm to compute the Z-function\n\n    To obtain an efficient algorithm we will compute the values of $z[i]$ in turn from $i = 1$ to $n - 1$ but at the same time, when computing a new value, we'll try to make the best use possible of the previously computed values.\n\n    For the sake of brevity, let's call **segment matches** those substrings that coincide with a prefix of $s$. For example, the value of the desired Z-function $z[i]$ is the length of the segment match starting at position $i$ (and that ends at position $i + z[i] - 1$).\n\n    To do this, we will keep **the $[l, r)$ indices of the rightmost segment match**. That is, among all detected segments we will keep the one that ends rightmost. In a way, the index $r$ can be seen as the \"boundary\" to which our string $s$ has been scanned by the algorithm; everything beyond that point is not yet known.\n\n    Then, if the current index (for which we have to compute the next value of the Z-function) is $i$, we have one of two options:\n\n    *   $i \\geq r$ -- the current position is **outside** of what we have already processed.\n\n        We will then compute $z[i]$ with the **trivial algorithm** (that is, just comparing values one by one). Note that in the end, if $z[i] > 0$, we'll have to update the indices of the rightmost segment, because it's guaranteed that the new $r = i + z[i]$ is better than the previous $r$.\n\n    *   $i < r$ -- the current position is inside the current segment match $[l, r)$.\n\n        Then we can use the already calculated Z-values to \"initialize\" the value of $z[i]$ to something (it sure is better than \"starting from zero\"), maybe even some big number.\n\n        For this, we observe that the substrings $s[l \\dots r)$ and $s[0 \\dots r-l)$ **match**. This means that as an initial approximation for $z[i]$ we can take the value already computed for the corresponding segment $s[0 \\dots r-l)$, and that is $z[i-l]$.\n\n        However, the value $z[i-l]$ could be too large: when applied to position $i$ it could exceed the index $r$. This is not allowed because we know nothing about the characters to the right of $r$: they may differ from those required.\n\n        Here is **an example** of a similar scenario:\n\n        $$ s = \"aaaabaa\" $$\n\n        When we get to the last position ($i = 6$), the current match segment will be $[5, 7)$. Position $6$ will then match position $6 - 5 = 1$, for which the value of the Z-function is $z[1] = 3$. Obviously, we cannot initialize $z[6]$ to $3$, it would be completely incorrect. The maximum value we could initialize it to is $1$ -- because it's the largest value that doesn't bring us beyond the index $r$ of the match segment $[l, r)$.\n\n        Thus, as an **initial approximation** for $z[i]$ we can safely take:\n\n        $$ z_0[i] = \\min(r - i,\\; z[i-l]) $$\n\n        After having $z[i]$ initialized to $z_0[i]$, we try to increment $z[i]$ by running the **trivial algorithm** -- because in general, after the border $r$, we cannot know if the segment will continue to match or not.\n\n    Thus, the whole algorithm is split in two cases, which differ only in **the initial value** of $z[i]$: in the first case it's assumed to be zero, in the second case it is determined by the previously computed values (using the above formula). After that, both branches of this algorithm can be reduced to the implementation of **the trivial algorithm**, which starts immediately after we specify the initial value.\n\n    The algorithm turns out to be very simple. Despite the fact that on each iteration the trivial algorithm is run, we have made significant progress, having an algorithm that runs in linear time. Later on we will prove that the running time is linear.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Implementation turns out to be rather concise:\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> z_function(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> z(n);\n        int l = 0, r = 0;\n        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if(i < r) {\n                z[i] = min(r - i, z[i - l]);\n            }\n            while(i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {\n                z[i]++;\n            }\n            if(i + z[i] > r) {\n                l = i;\n                r = i + z[i];\n            }\n        }\n        return z;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

A. Huffman discovered this method\n    when solving a university course assignment\n    and published the algorithm in 1952 \\cite{huf52}.} is a greedy algorithm\n    that constructs an optimal code for\n    compressing a given string.\n    The algorithm builds a binary tree\n    based on the frequencies of the characters\n    in the string,\n    and each character's codeword can be read\n    by following a path from the root to\n    the corresponding node.\n    A move to the left corresponds to bit 0,\n    and a move to the right corresponds to bit 1.\n\n    Initially, each character of the string is\n    represented by a node whose weight is the\n    number of times the character occurs in the string.\n    Then at each step two nodes with minimum weights\n    are combined by creating\n    a new node whose weight is the sum of the weights\n    of the original nodes.\n    The process continues until all nodes have been combined.\n\n    Next we will see how Huffman coding creates\n    the optimal code for the string\n    \\texttt{AABACDACA}.\n    Initially, there are four nodes that correspond\n    to the characters of the string:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n

Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm\n    Part: 3/4\n    ```\n\n    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\\pi$, and then compute the final answers:\n    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.\n    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.\n\n    Now let us consider the second problem.\n    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:\n    we create the string $s + \\# + t$ and compute its prefix function.\n    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\\pi[i]$ for $i \\ge n + 1$.\n    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.\n\n    ### The number of different substring in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.\n\n    We will solve this problem iteratively.\n    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.\n\n    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.\n    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.\n    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.\n\n    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.\n    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.\n    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ long.\n    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.\n\n    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \\pi_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.\n\n    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.\n\n    ### Compressing a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to find the shortest \"compressed\" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.\n\n    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.\n    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \\pi[n - 1]$.\n    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.\n\n    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.\n    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.\n    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.\n    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.\n    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.\n    And so on.\n    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.\n\n    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.\n    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.\n    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.\n\n    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.\n    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.\n    We prove it by contradiction.\n    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).\n    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.\n    Now consider the second block of the string.\n    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.\n    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.\n    Contradiction.\n\n    $$\\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \\overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$\n\n    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\\pi[7] = 5}$$\n\n    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \\Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$\n\n    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function\n\n    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \\# + t$.\n    Obviously, since $\\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.\n    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \\#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:\n\n    $$\\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \\dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \\#}_{\\text{need to store}} ~ \\underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \\dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\\text{do not need to store}}$$\n\n    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \\in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.\n\n    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.\n\n    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\\text{old}_\\pi, c) \\rightarrow \\text{new}_\\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                int j = i;\n                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])\n                    j = pi[j-1];\n                if ('a' + c == s[j])\n                    j++;\n                aut[i][c] = j;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.\n    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.\n    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n

Title: String Hashing\n    Part: 1/2\n    # String Hashing\n\n    Hashing algorithms are helpful in solving a lot of problems.\n\n    We want to solve the problem of comparing strings efficiently.\n    The brute force way of doing so is just to compare the letters of both strings, which has a time complexity of $O(\\min(n_1, n_2))$ if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sizes of the two strings.\n    We want to do better.\n    The idea behind the string hashing is the following: we map each string into an integer and compare those instead of the strings.\n    Doing this allows us to reduce the execution time of the string comparison to $O(1)$.\n\n    For the conversion, we need a so-called **hash function**.\n    The goal of it is to convert a string into an integer, the so-called **hash** of the string.\n    The following condition has to hold: if two strings $s$ and $t$ are equal ($s = t$), then also their hashes have to be equal ($\\text{hash}(s) = \\text{hash}(t)$).\n    Otherwise, we will not be able to compare strings.\n\n    Notice, the opposite direction doesn't have to hold.\n    If the hashes are equal ($\\text{hash}(s) = \\text{hash}(t)$), then the strings do not necessarily have to be equal.\n    E.g. a valid hash function would be simply $\\text{hash}(s) = 0$ for each $s$.\n    Now, this is just a stupid example, because this function will be completely useless, but it is a valid hash function.\n    The reason why the opposite direction doesn't have to hold, is because there are exponentially many strings.\n    If we only want this hash function to distinguish between all strings consisting of lowercase characters of length smaller than 15, then already the hash wouldn't fit into a 64-bit integer (e.g. unsigned long long) any more, because there are so many of them.\n    And of course, we don't want to compare arbitrary long integers, because this will also have the complexity $O(n)$.\n\n    So usually we want the hash function to map strings onto numbers of a fixed range $[0, m)$, then comparing strings is just a comparison of two integers with a fixed length.\n    And of course, we want $\\text{hash}(s) \\neq \\text{hash}(t)$ to be very likely if $s \\neq t$.\n\n    That's the important part that you have to keep in mind.\n    Using hashing will not be 100% deterministically correct, because two complete different strings might have the same hash (the hashes collide).\n    However, in a wide majority of tasks, this can be safely ignored as the probability of the hashes of two different strings colliding is still very small.\n    And we will discuss some techniques in this article how to keep the probability of collisions very low.\n\n    ## Calculation of the hash of a string\n\n    The good and widely used way to define the hash of a string $s$ of length $n$ is\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    \\text{hash}(s) &= s[0] + s[1] \\cdot p + s[2] \\cdot p^2 + ... + s[n-1] \\cdot p^{n-1} \\mod m \\\\\n    &= \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \\cdot p^i \\mod m,\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    where $p$ and $m$ are some chosen, positive numbers.\n    It is called a **polynomial rolling hash function**.\n\n    It is reasonable to make $p$ a prime number roughly equal to the number of characters in the input alphabet.\n    For example, if the input is composed of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, $p = 31$ is a good choice.\n    If the input may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, then $p = 53$ is a possible choice.\n    The code in this article will use $p = 31$.\n\n    Obviously $m$ should be a large number since the probability of two random strings colliding is about $\\approx \\frac{1}{m}$.\n    Sometimes $m = 2^{64}$ is chosen, since then the integer overflows of 64-bit integers work exactly like the modulo operation.\n    However, there exists a method, which generates colliding strings (which work independently from the choice of $p$).\n    So in practice, $m = 2^{64}$ is not recommended.\n    A good choice for $m$ is some large prime number.\n    The code in this article will just use $m = 10^9+9$.\n    This is a large number, but still small enough so that we can perform multiplication of two values using 64-bit integers.\n\n    Here is an example of calculating the hash of a string $s$, which contains only lowercase letters.\n    We convert each character of $s$ to an integer.\n    Here we use the conversion $a \\rightarrow 1$, $b \\rightarrow 2$, $\\dots$, $z \\rightarrow 26$.\n    Converting $a \\rightarrow 0$ is not a good idea, because then the hashes of the strings $a$, $aa$, $aaa$, $\\dots$ all evaluate to $0$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=hashing_function}\n    long long compute_hash(string const& s) {\n        const int p = 31;\n        const int m = 1e9 + 9;\n        long long hash_value = 0;\n        long long p_pow = 1;\n        for (char c : s) {\n            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;\n            p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;\n        }\n        return hash_value;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Precomputing the powers of $p$ might give a performance boost.\n\n    ## Example tasks\n\n    ### Search for duplicate strings in an array of strings\n\n    Problem: Given a list of $n$ strings $s_i$, each no longer than $m$ characters, find all the duplicate strings and divide them into groups.\n\n    From the obvious algorithm involving sorting the strings, we would get a time complexity of $O(n m \\log n)$ where the sorting requires $O(n \\log n)$ comparisons and each comparison take $O(m)$ time.\n    However, by using hashes, we reduce the comparison time to $O(1)$, giving us an algorithm that runs in $O(n m + n \\log n)$ time.\n\n    We calculate the hash for each string, sort the hashes together with the indices, and then group the indices by identical hashes.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=hashing_group_identical_strings}\n    vector<vector<int>> group_identical_strings(vector<string> const& s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<pair<long long, int>> hashes(n);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n            hashes[i] = {compute_hash(s[i]), i};\n\n        sort(hashes.begin(), hashes.end());\n\n        vector<vector<int>> groups;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            if (i == 0 || hashes[i].first != hashes[i-1].first)\n                groups.emplace_back();\n            groups.back().push_back(hashes[i].second);\n        }\n        return groups;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

of problems.\n\n    We want to solve the problem of comparing strings efficiently.\n    The brute force way of doing so is just to compare the letters of both strings, which has a time complexity of $O(\\min(n_1, n_2))$ if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sizes of the two strings.\n    We want to do better.\n    The idea behind the string hashing is the following: we map each string into an integer and compare those instead of the strings.\n    Doing this allows us to reduce the execution time of the string comparison to $O(1)$.\n\n    For the conversion, we need a so-called **hash function**.\n    The goal of it is to convert a string into an integer, the so-called **hash** of the string.\n    The following condition has to hold: if two strings $s$ and $t$ are equal ($s = t$), then also their hashes have to be equal ($\\text{hash}(s) = \\text{hash}(t)$).\n    Otherwise, we will not be able to compare strings.\n\n    Notice, the opposite direction doesn't have to hold.\n    If the hashes are equal ($\\text{hash}(s) = \\text{hash}(t)$), then the strings do not necessarily have to be equal.\n    E.g. a valid hash function would be simply $\\text{hash}(s) = 0$ for each $s$.\n    Now, this is just a stupid example, because this function will be completely useless, but it is a valid hash function.\n    The reason why the opposite direction doesn't have to hold, is because there are exponentially many strings.\n    If we only want this hash function to distinguish between all strings consisting of lowercase characters of length smaller than 15, then already the hash wouldn't fit into a 64-bit integer (e.g. unsigned long long) any more, because there are so many of them.\n    And of course, we don't want to compare arbitrary long integers, because this will also have the complexity $O(n)$.\n\n    So usually we want the hash function to map strings onto numbers of a fixed range $[0, m)$, then comparing strings is just a comparison of two integers with a fixed length.\n    And of course, we want $\\text{hash}(s) \\neq \\text{hash}(t)$ to be very likely if $s \\neq t$.\n\n    That's the important part that you have to keep in mind.\n    Using hashing will not be 100% deterministically correct, because two complete different strings might have the same hash (the hashes collide).\n    However, in a wide majority of tasks, this can be safely ignored as the probability of the hashes of two different strings colliding is still very small.\n    And we will discuss some techniques in this article how to keep the probability of collisions very low.\n\n    ## Calculation of the hash of a string\n\n    The good and widely used way to define the hash of a string $s$ of length $n$ is\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    \\text{hash}(s) &= s[0] + s[1] \\cdot p + s[2] \\cdot p^2 + ... + s[n-1] \\cdot p^{n-1} \\mod m \\\\\n    &= \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \\cdot p^i \\mod m,\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    where $p$ and $m$ are some chosen, positive numbers.\n    It is called a **polynomial rolling hash function**.\n\n    It is reasonable to make $p$ a prime number roughly equal to the number of characters in the input alphabet.\n    For example, if the input is composed of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, $p = 31$ is a good choice.\n    If the input may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, then $p = 53$ is a possible choice.\n    The code in this article will use $p = 31$.\n\n    Obviously $m$ should be a large number since the probability of two random strings colliding is about $\\approx \\frac{1}{m}$.\n    Sometimes $m = 2^{64}$ is chosen, since then the integer overflows of 64-bit integers work exactly like the modulo operation.\n    However, there exists a method, which generates colliding strings (which work independently from the choice of $p$).\n    So in practice, $m = 2^{64}$ is not recommended.\n    A good choice for $m$ is some large prime number.\n    The code in this article will just use $m = 10^9+9$.\n    This is a large number, but still small enough so that we can perform multiplication of two values using 64-bit integers.\n\n    Here is an example of calculating the hash of a string $s$, which contains only lowercase letters.\n    We convert each character of $s$ to an integer.\n    Here we use the conversion $a \\rightarrow 1$, $b \\rightarrow 2$, $\\dots$, $z \\rightarrow 26$.\n    Converting $a \\rightarrow 0$ is not a good idea, because then the hashes of the strings $a$, $aa$, $aaa$, $\\dots$ all evaluate to $0$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=hashing_function}\n    long long compute_hash(string const& s) {\n        const int p = 31;\n        const int m = 1e9 + 9;\n        long long hash_value = 0;\n        long long p_pow = 1;\n        for (char c : s) {\n            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;\n            p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;\n        }\n        return hash_value;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Precomputing the powers of $p$ might give a performance boost.\n\n    ## Example tasks\n\n    ### Search for duplicate strings in an array of strings\n\n    Problem: Given a list of $n$ strings $s_i$, each no longer than $m$ characters, find all the duplicate strings and divide them into groups.\n\n    From the obvious algorithm involving sorting the strings, we would get a time complexity of $O(n m \\log n)$ where the sorting requires $O(n \\log n)$ comparisons and each comparison take $O(m)$ time.\n    However, by using hashes, we reduce the comparison time to $O(1)$, giving us an algorithm that runs in $O(n m + n \\log n)$ time.\n\n    We calculate the hash for each string, sort the hashes together with the indices, and then group the indices by identical hashes.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=hashing_group_identical_strings}\n

Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm\n    Part: 3/4\n    ```\n\n    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\\pi$, and then compute the final answers:\n    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.\n    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.\n\n    Now let us consider the second problem.\n    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:\n    we create the string $s + \\# + t$ and compute its prefix function.\n    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\\pi[i]$ for $i \\ge n + 1$.\n    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.\n\n    ### The number of different substring in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.\n\n    We will solve this problem iteratively.\n    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.\n\n    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.\n    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.\n    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.\n\n    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.\n    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.\n    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ long.\n    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.\n\n    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \\pi_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.\n\n    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.\n\n    ### Compressing a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to find the shortest \"compressed\" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.\n\n    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.\n    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \\pi[n - 1]$.\n    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.\n\n    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.\n    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.\n    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.\n    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.\n    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.\n    And so on.\n    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.\n\n    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.\n    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.\n    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.\n\n    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.\n    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.\n    We prove it by contradiction.\n    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).\n    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.\n    Now consider the second block of the string.\n    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.\n    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.\n    Contradiction.\n\n    $$\\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \\overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$\n\n    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\\pi[7] = 5}$$\n\n    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \\Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$\n\n    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function\n\n    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \\# + t$.\n    Obviously, since $\\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.\n    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \\#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:\n\n    $$\\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \\dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \\#}_{\\text{need to store}} ~ \\underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \\dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\\text{do not need to store}}$$\n\n    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \\in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.\n\n    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.\n\n    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\\text{old}_\\pi, c) \\rightarrow \\text{new}_\\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                int j = i;\n                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])\n                    j = pi[j-1];\n                if ('a' + c == s[j])\n                    j++;\n                aut[i][c] = j;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.\n    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.\n    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n

aut[pi[i-1]][c];\n                else\n                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n

 The brute force way of doing so is just to compare the letters of both strings, which has a time complexity of $O(\\min(n_1, n_2))$ if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sizes of the two strings.\n    We want to do better.\n    The idea behind the string hashing is the following: we map each string into an integer and compare those instead of the strings.\n    Doing this allows us to reduce the execution

   For example, the following binary code\n    assigns codewords for characters\n    \\texttt{A}\u2013\\texttt{D}:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rr}\n    character & codeword \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\texttt{A} & 00 \\\\\n    \\texttt{B} & 01 \\\\\n    \\texttt{C} & 10 \\\\\n    \\texttt{D} & 11 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n    This is a \\key{constant-length} code\n    which means that the length of each\n    codeword is the same.\n    For example, we can compress the string\n    \\texttt{AABACDACA} as follows:\n    \\[00\\,00\\,01\\,00\\,10\\,11\\,00\\,10\\,00\\]\n    Using this code, the length of the compressed\n    string is 18 bits.\n    However, we can compress the string better\n    if we use a \\key{variable-length} code\n    where codewords may have different lengths.\n    Then we can give short codewords for\n    characters that appear often\n    and long codewords for characters\n    that appear rarely.\n    It turns out that an \\key{optimal} code\n    for the above string is as follows:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rr}\n    character & codeword \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\texttt{A} & 0 \\\\\n    \\texttt{B} & 110 \\\\\n    \\texttt{C} & 10 \\\\\n    \\texttt{D} & 111 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n    An optimal code produces a compressed string\n    that is as short as possible.\n    In this case, the compressed string using\n    the optimal code is\n    \\[0\\,0\\,110\\,0\\,10\\,111\\,0\\,10\\,0,\\]\n    so only 15 bits are needed instead of 18 bits.\n    Thus, thanks to a better code it was possible to\n    save 3 bits in the compressed string.\n\n    We require that no codeword\n    is a prefix of another codeword.\n    For example, it is not allowed that a code\n    would contain both codewords 10\n    and 1011.\n    The reason for this is that we want\n    to be able to generate the original string\n    from the compressed string.\n    If a codeword could be a prefix of another codeword,\n    this would not always be possible.\n    For example, the following code is \\emph{not} valid:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rr}\n    character & codeword \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\texttt{A} & 10 \\\\\n    \\texttt{B} & 11 \\\\\n    \\texttt{C} & 1011 \\\\\n    \\texttt{D} & 111 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n    Using this code, it would not be possible to know\n    if the compressed string 1011 corresponds to\n    the string \\texttt{AB} or the string \\texttt{C}.\n\n    \\index{Huffman coding}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Huffman coding}\n\n    \\key{Huffman coding}\\footnote{D. A. Huffman discovered this method\n    when solving a university course assignment\n    and published the algorithm in 1952 \\cite{huf52}.} is a greedy algorithm\n    that constructs an optimal code for\n    compressing a given string.\n    The algorithm builds a binary tree\n    based on the frequencies of the characters\n    in the string,\n    and each character's codeword can be read\n    by following a path from the root to\n    the corresponding node.\n    A move to the left corresponds to bit 0,\n    and a move to the right corresponds to bit 1.\n\n    Initially, each character of the string is\n    represented by a node whose weight is the\n    number of times the character occurs in the string.\n    Then at each step two nodes with minimum weights\n    are combined by creating\n    a new node whose weight is the sum of the weights\n    of the original nodes.\n    The process continues until all nodes have been combined.\n\n    Next we will see how Huffman coding creates\n    the optimal code for the string\n    \\texttt{AABACDACA}.\n    Initially, there are four nodes that correspond\n    to the characters of the string:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]\n    \\node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,0) {$5$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,0) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (3) at (4,0) {$2$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (4) at (6,0) {$1$};\n\n    \\node[color=blue] at (0,-0.75) {\\texttt{A}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (2,-0.75) {\\texttt{B}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (4,-0.75) {\\texttt{C}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (6,-0.75) {\\texttt{D}};\n\n    %\\path[draw,thick,-] (4) -- (5);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    The node that represents character \\texttt{A}\n    has weight 5 because character \\texttt{A}\n    appears 5 times in the string.\n    The other weights have been calculated\n    in the same way.\n\n    The first step is to combine the nodes that\n    correspond to characters \\texttt{B} and \\texttt{D},\n    both with weight 1.\n    The result is:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]\n    \\node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,0) {$5$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (3) at (2,0) {$2$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (2) at (4,0) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (4) at (6,0) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (5) at (5,1) {$2$};\n\n    \\node[color=blue] at (0,-0.75) {\\texttt{A}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (2,-0.75) {\\texttt{C}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (4,-0.75) {\\texttt{B}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (6,-0.75) {\\texttt{D}};\n\n    \\node at (4.3,0.7) {0};\n    \\node at (5.7,0.7) {1};\n\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (4) -- (5);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    After this, the nodes with weight 2 are combined:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]\n    \\node[draw, circle] (1) at (1,0) {$5$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (3) at (3,1) {$2$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (2) at (4,0) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (4) at (6,0) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (5) at (5,1) {$2$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (6) at (4,2) {$4$};\n\n    \\node[color=blue] at (1,-0.75) {\\texttt{A}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (3,1-0.75) {\\texttt{C}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (4,-0.75) {\\texttt{B}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (6,-0.75) {\\texttt{D}};\n\n    \\node at (4.3,0.7) {0};\n    \\node at (5.7,0.7) {1};\n    \\node at (3.3,1.7) {0};\n    \\node at (4.7,1.7) {1};\n\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (4) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (5) -- (6);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    Finally, the two remaining nodes are combined:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]\n    \\node[draw, circle] (1) at (2,2) {$5$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (3) at (3,1) {$2$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (2) at (4,0) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (4) at (6,0) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (5) at (5,1) {$2$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (6) at (4,2) {$4$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (7) at (3,3) {$9$};\n\n    \\node[color=blue] at (2,2-0.75) {\\texttt{A}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (3,1-0.75) {\\texttt{C}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (4,-0.75) {\\texttt{B}};\n    \\node[color=blue] at (6,-0.75) {\\texttt{D}};\n\n    \\node at (4.3,0.7) {0};\n    \\node at (5.7,0.7) {1};\n    \\node at (3.3,1.7) {0};\n    \\node at (4.7,1.7) {1};\n    \\node at (2.3,2.7) {0};\n    \\node at (3.7,2.7) {1};\n\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (4) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (5) -- (6);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (7);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (6) -- (7);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Now all nodes are in the tree, so the code is ready.\n    The following codewords can be read from the tree:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rr}\n    character & codeword \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\texttt{A} & 0 \\\\\n    \\texttt{B} & 110 \\\\\n    \\texttt{C} & 10 \\\\\n    \\texttt{D} & 111 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n
