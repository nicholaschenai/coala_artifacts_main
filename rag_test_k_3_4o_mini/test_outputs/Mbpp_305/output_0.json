    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of words and returns the first two words that start with the letter 'p'. If there are no such words, the function should not return anything.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the list of words.\n   - For each word, we will check if it starts with the letter 'p'.\n   - We will keep track of the words that meet this condition.\n   - Once we find two words that start with 'p', we will return them as a tuple.\n   - If we finish checking all words and find fewer than two, we will return nothing.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function start_withp(words):\n       initialize an empty list to hold words starting with 'p'\n       for each word in words:\n           if word starts with 'p':\n               add word to the list\n           if the list has 2 words:\n               return the first two words as a tuple\n       return nothing if fewer than 2 words found\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef start_withp(words):\n    # Initialize an empty list to hold words starting with 'p'\n    p_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each word in the input list\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word starts with 'p'\n        if word.startswith('p'):\n            # Add the word to the list of 'p' words\n            p_words.append(word)\n        \n        # If we have found two words, return them as a tuple\n        if len(p_words) == 2:\n            return (p_words[0], p_words[1])\n    \n    # If fewer than two words starting with 'p' were found, return nothing\n    return\n```",
