    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many elements in a given tuple appear before a specific element, which is itself a tuple. The function should return this count.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the elements of the input tuple. We will keep a count of how many elements we encounter until we reach the first tuple. Once we find the tuple, we will return the count of elements we have seen so far.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_first_elements(input_tuple):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each element in input_tuple:\n           if element is a tuple:\n               return count\n           increment count by 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_first_elements(input_tuple):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of elements before the tuple\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the input tuple\n    for element in input_tuple:\n        # Check if the current element is a tuple\n        if isinstance(element, tuple):\n            # If it is a tuple, return the count of elements seen so far\n            return count\n        # Increment the count for each non-tuple element\n        count += 1\n\n# The function is declared last as per the instructions\n```",
