INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/70 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if all the tuples in a given list have the same length. If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - First, check if the list of tuples is empty. If it is, we can return `True` since there are no tuples to compare.
   - Next, we can determine the length of the first tuple and store it.
   - Then, we can iterate through the rest of the tuples in the list and compare their lengths to the length of the first tuple.
   - If we find any tuple that has a different length, we return `False`. If we finish checking all tuples without finding any differences, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function get_equal(tuples):
       if tuples is empty:
           return True
       first_length = length of the first tuple
       for each tuple in tuples:
           if length of tuple is not equal to first_length:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def get_equal(tuples):
    # Check if the list of tuples is empty
    if not tuples:
        return True
    
    # Get the length of the first tuple
    first_length = len(tuples[0])
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the list
    for tup in tuples:
        # Compare the length of the current tuple with the first tuple's length
        if len(tup) != first_length:
            return False  # Return False if any tuple has a different length
    
    return True  # Return True if all tuples have the same length

    Title: Balanced bracket sequences
    Part: 1/2
    # Balanced bracket sequences

    A **balanced bracket sequence** is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence, when inserted certain numbers and mathematical operations, gives a valid mathematical expression.
    Formally you can define balanced bracket sequence with:

    - $e$ (the empty string) is a balanced bracket sequence.
    - if $s$ is a balanced bracket sequence, then so is $(s)$.
    - if $s$ and $t$ are balanced bracket sequences, then so is $s t$.

    For instance $(())()$ is a balanced bracket sequence, but $())($ is not.

    Of course you can define other bracket sequences also with multiple bracket types in a similar fashion.

    In this article we discuss some classic problems involving balanced bracket sequences (for simplicity we will only call them sequences): validation, number of sequences, finding the lexicographical next sequence, generating all sequences of a certain size, finding the index of sequence, and generating the $k$-th sequences.
    We will also discuss two variations for the problems, the simpler version when only one type of brackets is allowed, and the harder case when there are multiple types.

    ## Balance validation

    We want to check if a given string is balanced or not.

    At first suppose there is only one type of bracket.
    For this case there exists a very simple algorithm.
    Let $\text{depth}$ be the current number of open brackets.
    Initially $\text{depth} = 0$.
    We iterate over all character of the string, if the current bracket character is an opening bracket, then we increment $\text{depth}$, otherwise we decrement it.
    If at any time the variable $\text{depth}$ gets negative, or at the end it is different from $0$, then the string is not a balanced sequence.
    Otherwise it is.

    If there are several bracket types involved, then the algorithm needs to be changes.
    Instead of a counter $\text{depth}$ we create a stack, in which we will store all opening brackets that we meet.
    If the current bracket character is an opening one, we put it onto the stack.
    If it is a closing one, then we check if the stack is non-empty, and if the top element of the stack is of the same type as the current closing bracket.
    If both conditions are fulfilled, then we remove the opening bracket from the stack.
    If at any time one of the conditions is not fulfilled, or at the end the stack is not empty, then the string is not balanced.
    Otherwise it is.

    ## Number of balanced sequences

    ### Formula

    The number of balanced bracket sequences with only one bracket type can be calculated using the [Catalan numbers](catalan-numbers.md).
    The number of balanced bracket sequences of length $2n$ ($n$ pairs of brackets) is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$$

    If we allow $k$ types of brackets, then each pair be of any of the $k$ types (independently of the others), thus the number of balanced bracket sequences is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} k^n$$

    ### Dynamic programming

    On the other hand these numbers can be computed using **dynamic programming**.
    Let $d[n]$ be the number of regular bracket sequences with $n$ pairs of bracket.
    Note that in the first position there is always an opening bracket.
    And somewhere later is the corresponding closing bracket of the pair.
    It is clear that inside this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence, and similarly after this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence.
    So to compute $d[n]$, we will look at how many balanced sequences of $i$ pairs of brackets are inside this first bracket pair, and how many balanced sequences with $n-1-i$ pairs are after this pair.
    Consequently the formula has the form:

    $$d[n] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d[i] \cdot d[n-1-i]$$

    The initial value for this recurrence is $d[0] = 1$.

    ## Finding the lexicographical next balanced sequence

    Here we only consider the case with one valid bracket type.

    Given a balanced sequence, we have to find the next (in lexicographical order) balanced sequence.

    It should be obvious, that we have to find the rightmost opening bracket, which we can replace by a closing bracket without violation the condition, that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets up to this position.
    After replacing this position, we can fill the remaining part of the string with the lexicographically minimal one: i.e. first with as much opening brackets as possible, and then fill up the remaining positions with closing brackets.
    In other words we try to leave a long as possible prefix unchanged, and the suffix gets replaced by the lexicographically minimal one.

    To find this position, we can iterate over the character from right to left, and maintain the balance $\text{depth}$ of open and closing brackets.
    When we meet an opening brackets, we will decrement $\text{depth}$, and when we meet a closing bracket, we increase it.
    If we are at some point meet an opening bracket, and the balance after processing this symbol is positive, then we have found the rightmost position that we can change.
    We change the symbol, compute the number of opening and closing brackets that we have to add to the right side, and arrange them in the lexicographically minimal way.

    If we find do suitable position, then this sequence is already the maximal possible one, and there is no answer.

    ```{.cpp file=next_balanced_brackets_sequence}
    bool next_balanced_sequence(string & s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '(')
                depth--;
            else
                depth++;

            if (s[i] == '(' && depth > 0) {
                depth--;
                int open = (n - i - 1 - depth) / 2;
                int close = n - i - 1 - open;
                string next = s.substr(0, i) + ')' + string(open, '(') + string(close, ')');
                s.swap(next);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    Title: 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution
    Part: 1/1
    # 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution

    This game is played on a $4 \times 4$ board. On this board there are $15$ playing tiles numbered from 1 to 15. One cell is left empty (denoted by 0). You need to get the board to the position presented below by repeatedly moving one of the tiles to the free space:

    $$\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\ 13 & 14 & 15 & 0 \end{matrix}$$

    The game "15 Puzzle” was created by Noyes Chapman in 1880.

    ## Existence Of The Solution

    Let's consider this problem: given a position on the board, determine whether a sequence of moves which leads to a solution exists.

    Suppose we have some position on the board:

    $$\begin{matrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \\ a_5 & a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \\ a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} \end{matrix}$$

    where one of the elements equals zero and indicates an empty cell $a_z  = 0$

    Let’s consider the permutation:

    $$a_1 a_2 ... a_{z-1} a_{z+1} ... a_{15} a_{16}$$

    i.e. the permutation of numbers corresponding to the position on the board without a zero element

    Let $N$ be the number of inversions in this permutation (i.e. the number of such elements $a_i$  and $a_j$  that $i < j$, but $a_i  > a_j$).

    Suppose $K$ is an index of a row where the empty element is located (i.e. using our convention, $K = (z - 1) \div \ 4 + 1$).

    Then, **the solution exists iff $N + K$ is even**.

    ## Implementation

    The algorithm above can be illustrated with the following program code:

    ```cpp
    int a[16];
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        cin >> a[i];

    int inv = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        if (a[i])
            for (int j=0; j<i; ++j)
                if (a[j] > a[i])
                    ++inv;
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        if (a[i] == 0)
            inv += 1 + i / 4;

    puts ((inv & 1) ? "No Solution" : "Solution Exists");
    ```

    ## Proof

    In 1879 Johnson proved that if $N + K$ is odd, then the solution doesn’t exist, and in the same year Story proved that all positions when $N + K$ is even have a solution.

    However, all these proofs were quite complex.

    In 1999 Archer proposed a much simpler proof (you can download his article [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf)).
