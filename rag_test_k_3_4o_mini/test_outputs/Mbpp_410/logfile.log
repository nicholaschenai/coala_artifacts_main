INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/410 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list containing different types of elements (like strings and numbers) and returns the smallest numerical value from that list. If there are no numerical values, the function should not return anything.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each element in the list. We will check if the element is a number (either an integer or a float). If it is, we will compare it with the current minimum value we have found. If it is smaller, we will update our minimum value. At the end of the iteration, we will return the smallest number we found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function min_val(input_list):

    Title: Minimum stack / Minimum queue
    Part: 1/1
    # Minimum stack / Minimum queue

    In this article we will consider three problems: 
    first we will modify a stack in a way that allows us to find the smallest element of the stack in $O(1)$, then we will do the same thing with a queue, and finally we will use these data structures to find the minimum in all subarrays of a fixed length in an array in $O(n)$

    ## Stack modification

    We want to modify the stack data structure in such a way, that it possible to find the smallest element in the stack in $O(1)$ time, while maintaining the same asymptotic behavior for adding and removing elements from the stack.
    Quick reminder, on a stack we only add and remove elements on one end.

    To do this, we will not only store the elements in the stack, but we will store them in pairs: the element itself and the minimum in the stack starting from this element and below.

    ```cpp
    stack<pair<int, int>> st;
    ```

    It is clear that finding the minimum in the whole stack consists only of looking at the value `stack.top().second`.

    It is also obvious that adding or removing a new element to the stack can be done in constant time.

    Implementation:

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    int new_min = st.empty() ? new_elem : min(new_elem, st.top().second);
    st.push({new_elem, new_min});
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    int removed_element = st.top().first;
    st.pop();
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = st.top().second;
    ```

    ## Queue modification (method 1)

    Now we want to achieve the same operations with a queue, i.e. we want to add elements at the end and remove them from the front.

    Here we consider a simple method for modifying a queue.
    It has a big disadvantage though, because the modified queue will actually not store all elements.

    The key idea is to only store the items in the queue that are needed to determine the minimum.
    Namely we will keep the queue in nondecreasing order (i.e. the smallest value will be stored in the head), and of course not in any arbitrary way, the actual minimum has to be always contained in the queue.
    This way the smallest element will always be in the head of the queue.
    Before adding a new element to the queue, it is enough to make a "cut":
    we will remove all trailing elements of the queue that are larger than the new element, and afterwards add the new element to the queue. 
    This way we don't break the order of the queue, and we will also not loose the current element if it is at any subsequent step the minimum. 
    All the elements that we removed can never be a minimum itself, so this operation is allowed.
    When we want to extract an element from the head, it actually might not be there (because we removed it previously while adding a smaller element). 
    Therefore when deleting an element from a queue we need to know the value of the element.
    If the head of the queue has the same value, we can safely remove it, otherwise we do nothing.

    Consider the implementations of the above operations:

    ```cpp
    deque<int> q;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = q.front();
    ```

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    while (!q.empty() && q.back() > new_element)
        q.pop_back();
    q.push_back(new_element);
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (!q.empty() && q.front() == remove_element)
        q.pop_front();
    ```

    It is clear that on average all these operation only take $O(1)$ time (because every element can only be pushed and popped once).

    ## Queue modification (method 2)

    This is a modification of method 1.
    We want to be able to remove elements without knowing which element we have to remove.
    We can accomplish that by storing the index for each element in the queue.
    And we also remember how many elements we already have added and removed.

    ```cpp
    deque<pair<int, int>> q;
    int cnt_added = 0;
    int cnt_removed = 0;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = q.front().first;
    ```

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    while (!q.empty() && q.back().first > new_element)
        q.pop_back();
    q.push_back({new_element, cnt_added});
    cnt_added++;
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (!q.empty() && q.front().second == cnt_removed) 
        q.pop_front();
    cnt_removed++;
    ```

    ## Queue modification (method 3)

    Here we consider another way of modifying a queue to find the minimum in $O(1)$.
    This way is somewhat more complicated to implement, but this time we actually store all elements.
    And we also can remove an element from the front without knowing its value.

    The idea is to reduce the problem to the problem of stacks, which was already solved by us.
    So we only need to learn how to simulate a queue using two stacks.

    We make two stacks, `s1` and `s2`. 
    Of course these stack will be of the modified form, so that we can find the minimum in $O(1)$. 
    We will add new elements to the stack `s1`, and remove elements from the stack `s2`.
    If at any time the stack `s2` is empty, we move all elements from `s1` to `s2` (which essentially reverses the order of those elements).
    Finally finding the minimum in a queue involves just finding the minimum of both stacks.

    Thus we perform all operations in $O(1)$ on average (each element will be once added to stack `s1`, once transferred to `s2`, and once popped from `s2`)

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    stack<pair<int, int>> s1, s2;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    if (s1.empty() || s2.empty()) 
        minimum = s1.empty() ? s2.top().second : s1.top().second;
    else
        minimum = min(s1.top().second, s2.top().second);
    ```

    * Add element:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = s1.empty() ? new_element : min(new_element, s1.top().second);
    s1.push({new_element, minimum});
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (s2.empty()) {
        while (!s1.empty()) {
            int element = s1.top().first;
            s1.pop();
            int minimum = s2.empty() ? element : min(element, s2.top().second);
            s2.push({element, minimum});
        }
    }
    int remove_element = s2.top().first;
    s2.pop();
    ```

    ## Finding the minimum for all subarrays of fixed length

    Suppose we are given an array $A$ of length $N$ and a given $M \le N$.
    We have to find the minimum of each subarray of length $M$ in this array, i.e. we have to find:

    $$\min_{0 \le i \le M-1} A[i], \min_{1 \le i \le M} A[i], \min_{2 \le i \le M+1} A[i],~\dots~, \min_{N-M \le i \le N-1} A[i]$$

    We have to solve this problem in linear time, i.e. $O(n)$.

    We can use any of the three modified queues to solve the problem.
    The solutions should be clear:
    we add the first $M$ element of the array, find and output its minimum, then add the next element to the queue and remove the first element of the array, find and output its minimum, etc. 
    Since all operations with the queue are performed in constant time on average, the complexity of the whole algorithm will be $O(n)$.

    Section: Minimizing sums
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.

    \[ \lfloor 3/2 \rfloor = 1 \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} \lceil 3/2 \rceil = 2.\]

    The functions $\min(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$
    and $\max(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$
    give the smallest and largest of values
    $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$.
    For example,
    \[ \min(1,2,3)=1 \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} \max(1,2,3)=3.\]

    \index{factorial}

    The \key{factorial} $n!$ can be defined
    \[\prod_{x=1}^n x = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot n\]
    or recursively
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    0! & = & 1 \\
    n! & = & n \cdot (n-1)! \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    \index{Fibonacci number}

    The \key{Fibonacci numbers}
    %\footnote{Fibonacci (c. 1175--1250) was an Italian mathematician.}
    arise in many situations.
    They can be defined recursively as follows:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    f(0) & = & 0 \\
    f(1) & = & 1 \\
    f(n) & = & f(n-1)+f(n-2) \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    The first Fibonacci numbers are
    \[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, \ldots\]
    There is also a closed-form formula
    for calculating Fibonacci numbers, which is sometimes called
    \index{Binet's formula} \key{Binet's formula}:
    \[f(n)=\frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})^n - (1-\sqrt{5})^n}{2^n \sqrt{5}}.\]

    \subsubsection{Logarithms}

    \index{logarithm}

    The \key{logarithm} of a number $x$
    is denoted $\log_k(x)$, where $k$ is the base
    of the logarithm.
    According to the definition,
    $\log_k(x)=a$ exactly when $k^a=x$.

    A useful property of logarithms is
    that $\log_k(x)$ equals the number of times
    we have to divide $x$ by $k$ before we reach 
    the number 1.
    For example, $\log_2(32)=5$
    because 5 divisions by 2 are needed:

    \[32 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \]

    Logarithms are often used in the analysis of
    algorithms, because many efficient algorithms
    halve something at each step.
    Hence, we can estimate the efficiency of such algorithms
    using logarithms.

    The logarithm of a product is
    \[\log_k(ab) = \log_k(a)+\log_k(b),\]
    and consequently,
    \[\log_k(x^n) = n \cdot \log_k(x).\]
    In addition, the logarithm of a quotient is
    \[\log_k\Big(\frac{a}{b}\Big) = \log_k(a)-\log_k(b).\]
    Another useful formula is
    \[\log_u(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(u)},\]
    and using this, it is possible to calculate
    logarithms to any base if there is a way to
    calculate logarithms to some fixed base.

    \index{natural logarithm}

    The \key{natural logarithm} $\ln(x)$ of a number $x$
    is a logarithm whose base is $e \approx 2.71828$.
    Another property of logarithms is that
    the number of digits of an integer $x$ in base $b$ is
    $\lfloor \log_b(x)+1 \rfloor$.
    For example, the representation of
    $123$ in base $2$ is 1111011 and
    $\lfloor \log_2(123)+1 \rfloor = 7$.

   We need to create a function that takes a list containing different types of elements (like strings and numbers) and returns the smallest numerical value from that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We will iterate through the list, checking each element to see if it is a number. If it is, we will compare it to the current minimum value found. We will keep track of the smallest number we find and return it at the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function min_val(input_list):
       initialize min_value to None
       for each element in input_list:
           if element is a number:
               if min_value is None or element < min_value:
                   set min_value to element
       return min_value
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def min_val(input_list):
    # Initialize min_value to None to track the minimum number found
    min_value = None
    
    # Iterate through each element in the input list
    for element in input_list:
        # Check if the element is a number (int or float)
        if isinstance(element, (int, float)):
            # If min_value is None or the current element is less than min_value
            if min_value is None or element < min_value:
                # Update min_value to the current element
                min_value = element
    
    # Return the minimum value found
    return min_value
```
