For example, consider the following macro\n    that calculates the square of a number:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #define SQ(a) a*a\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    This macro \\emph{does not} always work as expected.\n    For example, the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << SQ(3+3) << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    corresponds to the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << 3+3*3+3 << \"\\n\"; // 15\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    A better version of the macro is as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #define SQ(a) (a)*(a)\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    Now the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << SQ(3+3) << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    corresponds to the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << (3+3)*(3+3) << \"\\n\"; // 36\n

\\index{2SAT problem}\n\n    Strong connectivity is also linked with the\n    \\key{2SAT problem}\\footnote{The algorithm presented here was\n    introduced in \\cite{asp79}.\n    There is also another well-known linear-time algorithm \\cite{eve75}\n    that is based on backtracking.}.\n    In this problem, we are given a logical formula\n    \\[\n    (a_1 \\lor b_1) \\land (a_2 \\lor b_2) \\land \\cdots \\land (a_m \\lor b_m),\n    \\]\n    where each $a_i$ and $b_i$ is either a logical variable\n    ($x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$)\n    or a negation of a logical variable\n    ($\\lnot x_1, \\lnot x_2, \\ldots, \\lnot x_n$).\n    The symbols ''$\\land$'' and ''$\\lor$'' denote\n    logical operators ''and'' and ''or''.\n    Our task is to assign each variable a value\n    so that the formula is true, or state\n    that this is not possible.\n\n    For example, the formula\n    \\[\n    L_1 = (x_2 \\lor \\lnot x_1) \\land\n          (\\lnot x_1 \\lor \\lnot x_2) \\land\n

x_1 = \\textrm{false} \\\\\n    x_2 = \\textrm{false} \\\\\n    x_3 = \\textrm{true} \\\\\n    x_4 = \\textrm{true} \\\\\n    \\end{cases}\n    \\]\n\n    However, the formula\n    \\[\n    L_2 = (x_1

assign the values.\n    The reason for this is that we cannot\n    choose a value for $x_1$\n    without creating a contradiction.\n    If $x_1$ is false, both $x_2$ and $\\lnot x_2$\n    should be true which is impossible,\n    and if $x_1$ is true, both $x_3$ and $\\lnot x_3$\n    should be true which is also impossible.\n\n    The 2SAT problem can be represented as a graph\n    whose nodes correspond to\n    variables $x_i$ and negations $\\lnot x_i$,\n    and edges determine the connections\n    between the variables.\n    Each pair $(a_i \\lor b_i)$ generates two edges:\n    $\\lnot a_i \\to b_i$ and $\\lnot b_i \\to a_i$.\n    This means that if $a_i$ does not hold,\n    $b_i$ must hold, and vice versa.\n\n    The graph for the formula $L_1$ is:\n    \\\\\n    \\begin{center}\n

variables\n    can be found by going through the nodes of the\n    component graph in a reverse topological sort order.\n    At each step, we process a component \n    that does not contain edges that lead to an\n    unprocessed component.\n    If the variables in the component\n    have not been assigned values,\n    their values will be determined\n    according to the values in the component,\n

constructing the solution,\n    we first process the component $D$\n    where $x_4$ becomes true.\n    After this, we process the component $C$\n    where $x_1$ and $x_2$ become false\n    and $x_3$ becomes true.\n    All variables have been assigned values,\n    so the remaining components $A$ and $B$\n    do not change the variables.\n\n    Note that this method works, because the\n    graph has a special structure:\n    if there are paths from node $x_i$ to node $x_j$\n    and from node $x_j$ to node $\\lnot x_j$,\n    then node $x_i$ never becomes true.\n    The reason for this is that

segment\n\n    The task is: given the coordinates of the ends of a segment, construct a line passing through it.\n\n    We assume that the segment is non-degenerate, i.e. has a length greater than zero (otherwise, of course, infinitely many different lines pass through it).\n\n    ### Two-dimensional case\n\n    Let the given segment be $PQ$ i.e. the known coordinates of its ends $P_x , P_y , Q_x , Q_y$ .\n\n    It is necessary to construct **the equation of a line in the plane** passing through this segment, i.e. find the coefficients $A , B , C$ in the equation of a line:\n\n    $$A x + B y + C = 0.$$\n\n    Note that for the required triples $(A, B, C)$ there are **infinitely many** solutions which describe the given segment:\n    you can multiply all three coefficients by an arbitrary non-zero number and get the same straight line.\n    Therefore, our task is to find one of these triples.\n\n    It is easy to verify (by substitution of these expressions and the coordinates of the points $P$ and $Q$ into the equation of a straight line) that the following set of coefficients fits:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    A &= P_y - Q_y, \\\\\n    B &= Q_x - P_x, \\\\\n    C &= - A P_x - B P_y.\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    ### Integer case\n\n    An important advantage of this method of constructing a straight line is that if the coordinates of the ends were integer, then the coefficients obtained will also be **integer** . In some cases, this allows one to perform geometric operations without resorting to real numbers at all.\n\n    However, there is a small drawback: for the same straight line different triples of coefficients can be obtained.\n    To avoid this, but do not go away from the integer coefficients, you can apply the following technique, often called **rationing**. Find the [greatest common divisor](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md) of numbers $| A | , | B | , | C |$ , we divide all three coefficients by it, and then we make the normalization of the sign: if $A <0$ or $A = 0, B <0$ then multiply all three coefficients by $-1$ .\n    As a result, we will come to the conclusion that for identical straight lines, identical triples of coefficients will be obtained, which makes it easy to check straight lines for equality.\n\n    ### Real case\n\n    When working with real numbers, you should always be aware of errors.\n\n    The coefficients $A$ and $B$ will have the order of the original coordinates, the coefficient $C$ is of the order of the square of them. This may already be quite large numbers, and, for example, when we [intersect straight lines](lines-intersection.md), they will become even larger, which can lead to large rounding errors already when the coordinates of the end points are of order $10^3$.\n\n    Therefore, when working with real numbers, it is desirable to produce the so-called **normalization**, this is straightforward: namely, to make the coefficients such that $A ^ 2 + B ^ 2 = 1$ . To do this, calculate the number $Z$ :\n\n    $$Z = \\sqrt{A ^ 2 + B ^ 2},$$\n\n    and divide all three coefficients $A , B , C$ by it.\n\n    Thus, the order of the coefficients $A$ and $B$ will not depend on the order of the input coordinates, and the coefficient $C$ will be of the same order as the input coordinates. In practice, this leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of calculations.\n\n    Finally, we mention the **comparison** of straight lines - in fact, after such a normalization, for the same straight line, only two triples of coefficients can be obtained: up to multiplication by $-1$.\n    Accordingly, if we make an additional normalization taking into account the sign (if $A < -\\varepsilon$  or $| A | < \\varepsilon$, $B <- \\varepsilon$ then multiply by $-1$ ), the resulting coefficients will be unique.\n\n    ### Three-dimensional and multidimensional case\n\n    Already in the three-dimensional case there is **no simple equation** describing a straight line (it can be defined as the intersection of two planes, that is, a system of two equations, but this is an inconvenient method).\n\n    Consequently, in the three-dimensional and multidimensional cases we must use the **parametric method of defining a straight line** , i.e. as a point $p$ and a vector $v$ :\n\n    $$p + v t, ~~~ t \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\n\n    Those. a straight line is all points that can be obtained from a point $p$ adding a vector $v$ with an arbitrary coefficient.\n\n    The **construction** of a straight line in a parametric form along the coordinates of the ends of a segment is trivial, we just take one end of the segment for the point $p$, and the vector from the first to the second end \u2014 for the vector $v$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
