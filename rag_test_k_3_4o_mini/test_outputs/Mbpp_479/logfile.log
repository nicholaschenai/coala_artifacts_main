INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/479 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a number as input and returns the first digit of that number. For example, if the input is 123, the output should be 1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the first digit of a number, we can convert the number to a string. The first character of this string will be the first digit. We can then convert this character back to an integer to return it as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `first_Digit` that takes one parameter `num`.
   - Convert `num` to a string.
   - Access the first character of the string.
   - Convert this character back to an integer.
   - Return the integer.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def first_Digit(num: int) -> int:
    # Convert the number to a string to access its digits
    num_str = str(num)
    # Get the first character of the string
    first_char = num_str[0]
    # Convert the first character back to an integer
    first_digit = int(first_char)
    # Return the first digit
    return first_digit

    # Balanced Ternary

    !["Setun computer using Balanced Ternary system"](https://earltcampbell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/setun.jpeg?w=300)

    This is a non-standard but still positional **numeral system**. Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.
    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,
    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the
    computers utilizing it.

    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:

    ```nohighlight
        0    0
        1    1
        2    1Z
        3    10
        4    11
        5    1ZZ
        6    1Z0
        7    1Z1
        8    10Z
        9    100
    ```

    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.

    ```nohighlight
        -1   Z
        -2   Z1
        -3   Z0
        -4   ZZ
        -5   Z11
    ```

    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.

    ## Conversion algorithm

    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is
    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,
    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -
    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.

    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.

    The final result is `1Z101`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \cdot 1 + 27 \cdot (-1) + 9 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$

    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.

    The final result is `100Z10`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \cdot 1 + 81 \cdot 0 + 27 \cdot 0 + 9 \cdot (-1) + 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$

    Part: 1/2
    # Bit manipulation

    ## Binary number

    A **binary number** is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, it is a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).

    We say that a certain bit is **set**, if it is one, and **cleared** if it is zero.

    The binary number $(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2$ represents the number:

    $$(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2 = a_k \cdot 2^k + a_{k-1} \cdot 2^{k-1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot 2^1 + a_0 \cdot 2^0.$$

    For instance the binary number $1101_2$ represents the number $13$:

    $$\begin{align}
    1101_2 &= 1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 \\
           &= 1\cdot 8 + 1 \cdot 4 + 0 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 = 13
    \end{align}$$

    Computers represent integers as binary numbers.
    Positive integers (both signed and unsigned) are just represented with their binary digits, and negative signed numbers (which can be positive and negative) are usually represented with the [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).

    ```cpp
    unsigned int unsigned_number = 13;
    assert(unsigned_number == 0b1101);

    int positive_signed_number = 13;
    assert(positive_signed_number == 0b1101);

    int negative_signed_number = -13;
    assert(negative_signed_number == 0b1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'0011);
    ```

    CPUs are very fast manipulating those bits with specific operations.
    For some problems we can take these binary number representations to our advantage, and speed up the execution time.
    And for some problems (typically in combinatorics or dynamic programming) where we want to track which objects we already picked from a given set of objects, we can just use an large enough integer where each digit represents an object and depending on if we pick or drop the object we set or clear the digit.

    ## Bit operators

    All those introduced operators are instant (same speed as an addition) on a CPU for fixed-length integers.

    ### Bitwise operators

    -   $\&$ : The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand. 
        If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.
 	
    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.

    Examples:

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 01010000
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n | (n-1) = 01011111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    --------------------
    ~n        = 10100111
    ```

    ### Shift operators

    There are two operators for shifting bits.

    -   $\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.
        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \gg 2 = 101_2 \gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\frac{5}{2^2} = \frac{5}{4} = 1$.
        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.

    -   $\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.
        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \ll 3 = 101_2 \ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \cdot 2^3 = 5 \cdot 8 = 40$.

        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.


    ## Useful tricks

    ### Set/flip/clear a bit

    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.
    $1 \ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\sim(1 \ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.

    - $n ~|~ (1 \ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\wedge~ (1 \ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\&~ \sim(1 \ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$

    ### Check if a bit is set

    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.

    ``` cpp
    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {
        return (number >> x) & 1;
    }
    ```

    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2

    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).
    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.
    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.

    ``` cpp
    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {
        return n && !(n & (n - 1));
    }
    ```

    ### Clear the most-right set bit

    The expression $n ~\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.
    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.
    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.

    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:

    ```
    n         = 00110100
    n-1       = 00110011
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 00110000
    ```

    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm

    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.

    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.

    ``` cpp
    int countSetBits(int n)
    {
        int count = 0;
        while (n)
        {
            n = n & (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    Title: Fibonacci Numbers
    Part: 1/1
    # Fibonacci Numbers

    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

    $$F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

    The first elements of the sequence ([OEIS A000045](http://oeis.org/A000045)) are:

    $$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$

    ## Properties

    Fibonacci numbers possess a lot of interesting properties. Here are a few of them:

    * Cassini's identity:
  
    $$F_{n-1} F_{n+1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n$$

    * The "addition" rule:
  
    $$F_{n+k} = F_k F_{n+1} + F_{k-1} F_n$$

    * Applying the previous identity to the case $k = n$, we get:
  
    $$F_{2n} = F_n (F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})$$

    * From this we can prove by induction that for any positive integer $k$,  $F_{nk}$ is multiple of $F_n$.

    * The inverse is also true: if $F_m$ is multiple of $F_n$, then $m$ is multiple of $n$.

    * GCD identity:
  
    $$GCD(F_m, F_n) = F_{GCD(m, n)}$$

    * Fibonacci numbers are the worst possible inputs for Euclidean algorithm (see Lame's theorem in [Euclidean algorithm](euclid-algorithm.md))

    ## Fibonacci Coding

    We can use the sequence to encode positive integers into binary code words. According to Zeckendorf's theorem, any natural number $n$ can be uniquely represented as a sum of Fibonacci numbers:

    $$N = F_{k_1} + F_{k_2} + \ldots + F_{k_r}$$

    such that $k_1 \ge k_2 + 2,\ k_2 \ge k_3 + 2,\  \ldots,\  k_r \ge 2$ (i.e.: the representation cannot use two consecutive Fibonacci numbers).

    It follows that any number can be uniquely encoded in the Fibonacci coding.
    And we can describe this representation with binary codes $d_0 d_1 d_2 \dots d_s 1$, where $d_i$ is $1$ if $F_{i+2}$ is used in the representation.
    The code will be appended by a $1$ do indicate the end of the code word.
    Notice that this is the only occurrence where two consecutive 1-bits appear.

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    1 &=& 1 &=& F_2 &=& (11)_F \\
    2 &=& 2 &=& F_3 &=& (011)_F \\
    6 &=& 5 + 1 &=& F_5 + F_2 &=& (10011)_F \\
    8 &=& 8 &=& F_6 &=& (000011)_F \\
    9 &=& 8 + 1 &=& F_6 + F_2 &=& (100011)_F \\
    19 &=& 13 + 5 + 1 &=& F_7 + F_5 + F_2 &=& (1001011)_F
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    The encoding of an integer $n$ can be done with a simple greedy algorithm:

    1. Iterate through the Fibonacci numbers from the largest to the smallest until you find one less than or equal to $n$.

    2. Suppose this number was $F_i$. Subtract $F_i$ from $n$ and put a $1$ in the $i-2$ position of the code word (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit).

    3. Repeat until there is no remainder.

    4. Add a final $1$ to the codeword to indicate its end.

    To decode a code word, first remove the final $1$. Then, if the $i$-th bit is set (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit), sum $F_{i+2}$ to the number.


    ## Formulas for the $n^{\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number { data-toc-label="Formulas for the <script type='math/tex'>n</script>-th Fibonacci number" }

    ### Closed-form expression

    There is a formula known as "Binet's formula", even though it was already known by Moivre:

    $$F_n = \frac{\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n - \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n}{\sqrt{5}}$$

    This formula is easy to prove by induction, but it can be deduced with the help of the concept of generating functions or by solving a functional equation.

    You can immediately notice that the second term's absolute value is always less than $1$, and it also decreases very rapidly (exponentially). Hence the value of the first term alone is "almost" $F_n$. This can be written strictly as: 

    $$F_n = \left[\frac{\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n}{\sqrt{5}}\right]$$

    where the square brackets denote rounding to the nearest integer.

    As these two formulas would require very high accuracy when working with fractional numbers, they are of little use in practical calculations.

    ### Fibonacci in linear time

    The $n$-th Fibonacci number can be easily found in $O(n)$ by computing the numbers one by one up to $n$. However, there are also faster ways, as we will see.

    We can start from an iterative approach, to take advantage of the use of the formula $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, therefore, we will simply precalculate those values in an array. Taking into account the base cases for $F_0$ and $F_1$.

    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_linear}
    int fib(int n) {
        int a = 0;
        int b = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int tmp = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = tmp;
        }
        return a;
    }
    ```

    In this way, we obtain a linear solution, $O(n)$ time, saving all the values prior to $n$ in the sequence.

    ### Matrix form

    It is easy to prove the following relation:

    $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \cr 1 & 0 \cr\end{pmatrix} ^ n = \begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_{n} \cr F_{n} & F_{n-1} \cr\end{pmatrix}$$

    Thus, in order to find $F_n$ in $O(log  n)$ time, we must raise the matrix to n. (See [Binary exponentiation](binary-exp.md))

    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_matrix}
    struct matrix {
        long long mat[2][2];
        matrix friend operator *(const matrix &a, const matrix &b){

    ### Fast Doubling Method

    Using expanding the above matrix expression for $n = 2\cdot k$

    $$
    \begin{pmatrix}
    F_{2k+1} & F_{2k}\\
    F_{2k} & F_{2k-1}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1\\
    1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}^{2k}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    F_{k+1} & F_{k}\\
    F_{k} & F_{k-1}
    \end{pmatrix}
    ^2
    $$

    we can find these simpler equations:

    $$ \begin{align}
    F_{2k+1} &= F_{k+1}^2 + F_{k}^2 \\
    F_{2k} &= F_k(F_{k+1}+F_{k-1}) = F_k (2F_{k+1} - F_{k})\\
    \end{align}.$$

    Thus using above two equations Fibonacci numbers can be calculated easily by the following code:

    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_doubling}
    pair<int, int> fib (int n) {
        if (n == 0)
            return {0, 1};

        auto p = fib(n >> 1);
        int c = p.first * (2 * p.second - p.first);
        int d = p.first * p.first + p.second * p.second;
        if (n & 1)
            return {d, c + d};
        else
            return {c, d};
    }
    ```
    The above code returns $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ as a pair.

    ## Periodicity modulo p

    Consider the Fibonacci sequence modulo $p$. We will prove the sequence is periodic.

    Let us prove this by contradiction. Consider the first $p^2 + 1$ pairs of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo $p$:

    $$(F_0,\ F_1),\ (F_1,\ F_2),\ \ldots,\ (F_{p^2},\ F_{p^2 + 1})$$

    There can only be $p$ different remainders modulo $p$, and at most $p^2$ different pairs of remainders, so there are at least two identical pairs among them. This is sufficient to prove the sequence is periodic, as a Fibonacci number is only determined by it's two predecessors. Hence if two pairs of consecutive numbers repeat, that would also mean the numbers after the pair will repeat in the same fashion.

    We now choose two pairs of identical remainders with the smallest indices in the sequence. Let the pairs be $(F_a,\ F_{a + 1})$ and $(F_b,\ F_{b + 1})$. We will prove that $a = 0$. If this was false, there would be two previous pairs $(F_{a-1},\ F_a)$ and $(F_{b-1},\ F_b)$, which, by the property of Fibonacci numbers, would also be equal. However, this contradicts the fact that we had chosen pairs with the smallest indices, completing our proof that there is no pre-period (i.e the numbers are periodic starting from $F_0$).

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/479 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a Python function that takes a number as input and returns the first digit of that number. For example, if the input is 123, the output should be 1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the first digit of a number, we can convert the number to a string and access the first character. This character can then be converted back to an integer to return the first digit. Alternatively, we can repeatedly divide the number by 10 until it is less than 10, which will leave us with the first digit.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function first_Digit(number):
       if number is negative:
           number = absolute value of number
       while number >= 10:
           number = number // 10
       return number
