    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a Python function that takes a number as input and returns the first digit of that number. For example, if the input is 123, the output should be 1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the first digit of a number, we can convert the number to a string and access the first character. This character can then be converted back to an integer to return the first digit. Alternatively, we can repeatedly divide the number by 10 until it is less than 10, which will leave us with the first digit.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function first_Digit(number):\n       if number is negative:\n           number = absolute value of number\n       while number >= 10:\n           number = number // 10\n       return number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef first_Digit(number: int) -> int:\n    # If the number is negative, convert it to positive\n    if number < 0:\n        number = -number\n    # Keep dividing the number by 10 until it is less than 10\n    while number >= 10:\n        number //= 10\n    # Return the first digit\n    return number\n```",
