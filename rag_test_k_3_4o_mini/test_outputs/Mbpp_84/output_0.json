    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence. The sequence is defined such that each term is derived from the previous terms, specifically using the values of the two preceding terms.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The Newman-Conway sequence is defined as follows:\n   - The first term (n=1) is 1.\n   - The second term (n=2) is 1.\n   - For n > 2, the nth term is defined as the sum of the terms at positions given by the values of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th terms. In other words, `P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(P(n-2))`.\n   To compute the nth term, we can use a list to store the computed values of the sequence up to n, allowing us to build the sequence iteratively.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function sequence(n):\n       if n == 1 or n == 2:\n           return 1\n       create a list P of size n+1\n       P[1] = 1\n       P[2] = 1\n       for i from 3 to n:\n           P[i] = P[P[i-1]] + P[P[i-2]]\n       return P[n]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    # Handle base cases\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Create a list to store the sequence values\n    P = [0] * (n + 1)\n    P[1] = 1  # First term\n    P[2] = 1  # Second term\n    \n    # Fill the list with the Newman-Conway sequence values\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        P[i] = P[P[i - 1]] + P[P[i - 2]]\n    \n    # Return the nth term\n    return P[n]\n```",
