Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Catalan Numbers\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Catalan Numbers\n    Catalan numbers is a number sequence, which is found useful in a number of combinatorial problems, often involving recursively-defined objects.\n\n    This sequence was named after the Belgian mathematician [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan), who lived in the 19th century. (In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).\n\n    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):\n\n     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \\ldots$\n\n    ### Application in some combinatorial problems\n\n    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for\n\n    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.\n    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.\n    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.\n    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).\n    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.\n    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).\n    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \\times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).\n    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).\n    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.\n    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \\ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).\n\n\n    ## Calculations\n\n    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.\n\n    ### Recursive formula\n \n    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$\n\n    $$C_n = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \\geq 2$$\n\n    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.\n\n    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :\n\n    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    #### C++ implementation \n\n    ```cpp\n    const int MOD = ....\n    const int MAX = ....\n    int catalan[MAX];\n    void init() {\n        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;\n        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {\n            catalan[i] = 0;\n            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {\n                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;\n                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {\n                    catalan[i] -= MOD;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Analytical formula\n\n    $$C_n = \\frac{1}{n + 1} {\\binom{2n}{n}}$$\n\n    (here $\\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).\n\n    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \\times n$ is given by $\\binom{2n}{n}$.\n\n    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \\times n$.\n\n    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ are $\\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as \"bad\" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above \"bad\" paths, obtaining the formula:\n\n    $$C_n = \\binom{2n}{n} - \\binom{2n}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\binom{2n}{n} , {n} \\geq 0$$\n\n    ## Reference\n\n    - [Catalan Number by Tom Davis](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/catalan.pdf)\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Fibonacci Numbers\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Fibonacci Numbers\n\n    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n\n    $$F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$\n\n    The first elements of the sequence ([OEIS A000045](http://oeis.org/A000045)) are:\n\n    $$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$\n\n    ## Properties\n\n    Fibonacci numbers possess a lot of interesting properties. Here are a few of them:\n\n    * Cassini's identity:\n  \n    $$F_{n-1} F_{n+1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n$$\n\n    * The \"addition\" rule:\n  \n    $$F_{n+k} = F_k F_{n+1} + F_{k-1} F_n$$\n\n    * Applying the previous identity to the case $k = n$, we get:\n  \n    $$F_{2n} = F_n (F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})$$\n\n    * From this we can prove by induction that for any positive integer $k$,  $F_{nk}$ is multiple of $F_n$.\n\n    * The inverse is also true: if $F_m$ is multiple of $F_n$, then $m$ is multiple of $n$.\n\n    * GCD identity:\n  \n    $$GCD(F_m, F_n) = F_{GCD(m, n)}$$\n\n    * Fibonacci numbers are the worst possible inputs for Euclidean algorithm (see Lame's theorem in [Euclidean algorithm](euclid-algorithm.md))\n\n    ## Fibonacci Coding\n\n    We can use the sequence to encode positive integers into binary code words. According to Zeckendorf's theorem, any natural number $n$ can be uniquely represented as a sum of Fibonacci numbers:\n\n    $$N = F_{k_1} + F_{k_2} + \\ldots + F_{k_r}$$\n\n    such that $k_1 \\ge k_2 + 2,\\ k_2 \\ge k_3 + 2,\\  \\ldots,\\  k_r \\ge 2$ (i.e.: the representation cannot use two consecutive Fibonacci numbers).\n\n    It follows that any number can be uniquely encoded in the Fibonacci coding.\n    And we can describe this representation with binary codes $d_0 d_1 d_2 \\dots d_s 1$, where $d_i$ is $1$ if $F_{i+2}$ is used in the representation.\n    The code will be appended by a $1$ do indicate the end of the code word.\n    Notice that this is the only occurrence where two consecutive 1-bits appear.\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    1 &=& 1 &=& F_2 &=& (11)_F \\\\\n    2 &=& 2 &=& F_3 &=& (011)_F \\\\\n    6 &=& 5 + 1 &=& F_5 + F_2 &=& (10011)_F \\\\\n    8 &=& 8 &=& F_6 &=& (000011)_F \\\\\n    9 &=& 8 + 1 &=& F_6 + F_2 &=& (100011)_F \\\\\n    19 &=& 13 + 5 + 1 &=& F_7 + F_5 + F_2 &=& (1001011)_F\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    The encoding of an integer $n$ can be done with a simple greedy algorithm:\n\n    1. Iterate through the Fibonacci numbers from the largest to the smallest until you find one less than or equal to $n$.\n\n    2. Suppose this number was $F_i$. Subtract $F_i$ from $n$ and put a $1$ in the $i-2$ position of the code word (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit).\n\n    3. Repeat until there is no remainder.\n\n    4. Add a final $1$ to the codeword to indicate its end.\n\n    To decode a code word, first remove the final $1$. Then, if the $i$-th bit is set (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit), sum $F_{i+2}$ to the number.\n\n\n    ## Formulas for the $n^{\\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number { data-toc-label=\"Formulas for the <script type='math/tex'>n</script>-th Fibonacci number\" }\n\n    ### Closed-form expression\n\n    There is a formula known as \"Binet's formula\", even though it was already known by Moivre:\n\n    $$F_n = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt{5}}$$\n\n    This formula is easy to prove by induction, but it can be deduced with the help of the concept of generating functions or by solving a functional equation.\n\n    You can immediately notice that the second term's absolute value is always less than $1$, and it also decreases very rapidly (exponentially). Hence the value of the first term alone is \"almost\" $F_n$. This can be written strictly as: \n\n    $$F_n = \\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right]$$\n\n    where the square brackets denote rounding to the nearest integer.\n\n    As these two formulas would require very high accuracy when working with fractional numbers, they are of little use in practical calculations.\n\n    ### Fibonacci in linear time\n\n    The $n$-th Fibonacci number can be easily found in $O(n)$ by computing the numbers one by one up to $n$. However, there are also faster ways, as we will see.\n\n    We can start from an iterative approach, to take advantage of the use of the formula $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, therefore, we will simply precalculate those values in an array. Taking into account the base cases for $F_0$ and $F_1$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_linear}\n    int fib(int n) {\n        int a = 0;\n        int b = 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int tmp = a + b;\n            a = b;\n            b = tmp;\n        }\n        return a;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In this way, we obtain a linear solution, $O(n)$ time, saving all the values prior to $n$ in the sequence.\n\n    ### Matrix form\n\n    It is easy to prove the following relation:\n\n    $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\cr 1 & 0 \\cr\\end{pmatrix} ^ n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_{n} \\cr F_{n} & F_{n-1} \\cr\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n    Thus, in order to find $F_n$ in $O(log  n)$ time, we must raise the matrix to n. (See [Binary exponentiation](binary-exp.md))\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_matrix}\n    struct matrix {\n        long long mat[2][2];\n        matrix friend operator *(const matrix &a, const matrix &b){\n            matrix c;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n              for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {\n                  c.mat[i][j] = 0;\n                  for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {\n                      c.mat[i][j] += a.mat[i][k] * b.mat[k][j];\n                  }\n              }\n            }\n            return c;\n        }\n    };\n\n    matrix matpow(matrix base, long long n) {\n        matrix ans{ {\n          {1, 0},\n          {0, 1}\n        } };\n        while (n) {\n            if(n&1)\n                ans = ans*base;\n            base = base*base;\n            n >>= 1;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n\n    long long fib(int n) {\n        matrix base{ {\n          {1, 1},\n          {1, 0}\n        } };\n        return matpow(base, n).mat[0][1];\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Fast Doubling Method\n\n    Using expanding the above matrix expression for $n = 2\\cdot k$\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    F_{2k+1} & F_{2k}\\\\\n    F_{2k} & F_{2k-1}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    1 & 1\\\\\n    1 & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}^{2k}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    F_{k+1} & F_{k}\\\\\n    F_{k} & F_{k-1}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    ^2\n    $$\n\n    we can find these simpler equations:\n\n    $$ \\begin{align}\n    F_{2k+1} &= F_{k+1}^2 + F_{k}^2 \\\\\n    F_{2k} &= F_k(F_{k+1}+F_{k-1}) = F_k (2F_{k+1} - F_{k})\\\\\n    \\end{align}.$$\n\n    Thus using above two equations Fibonacci numbers can be calculated easily by the following code:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_doubling}\n    pair<int, int> fib (int n) {\n        if (n == 0)\n            return {0, 1};\n\n        auto p = fib(n >> 1);\n        int c = p.first * (2 * p.second - p.first);\n        int d = p.first * p.first + p.second * p.second;\n        if (n & 1)\n            return {d, c + d};\n        else\n            return {c, d};\n    }\n    ```\n    The above code returns $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ as a pair.\n\n    ## Periodicity modulo p\n\n    Consider the Fibonacci sequence modulo $p$. We will prove the sequence is periodic.\n\n    Let us prove this by contradiction. Consider the first $p^2 + 1$ pairs of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo $p$:\n\n    $$(F_0,\\ F_1),\\ (F_1,\\ F_2),\\ \\ldots,\\ (F_{p^2},\\ F_{p^2 + 1})$$\n\n    There can only be $p$ different remainders modulo $p$, and at most $p^2$ different pairs of remainders, so there are at least two identical pairs among them. This is sufficient to prove the sequence is periodic, as a Fibonacci number is only determined by it's two predecessors. Hence if two pairs of consecutive numbers repeat, that would also mean the numbers after the pair will repeat in the same fashion.\n\n    We now choose two pairs of identical remainders with the smallest indices in the sequence. Let the pairs be $(F_a,\\ F_{a + 1})$ and $(F_b,\\ F_{b + 1})$. We will prove that $a = 0$. If this was false, there would be two previous pairs $(F_{a-1},\\ F_a)$ and $(F_{b-1},\\ F_b)$, which, by the property of Fibonacci numbers, would also be equal. However, this contradicts the fact that we had chosen pairs with the smallest indices, completing our proof that there is no pre-period (i.e the numbers are periodic starting from $F_0$).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Fibonacci Numbers\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Fibonacci Numbers\n\n    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n\n    $$F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$\n\n    The first elements of the sequence ([OEIS A000045](http://oeis.org/A000045)) are:\n\n    $$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$\n\n    ## Properties\n\n    Fibonacci numbers possess a lot of interesting properties. Here are a few of them:\n\n    * Cassini's identity:\n  \n    $$F_{n-1} F_{n+1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n$$\n\n    * The \"addition\" rule:\n  \n    $$F_{n+k} = F_k F_{n+1} + F_{k-1} F_n$$\n\n    * Applying the previous identity to the case $k = n$, we get:\n  \n    $$F_{2n} = F_n (F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})$$\n\n    * From this we can prove by induction that for any positive integer $k$,  $F_{nk}$ is multiple of $F_n$.\n\n    * The inverse is also true: if $F_m$ is multiple of $F_n$, then $m$ is multiple of $n$.\n\n    * GCD identity:\n  \n    $$GCD(F_m, F_n) = F_{GCD(m, n)}$$\n\n    * Fibonacci numbers are the worst possible inputs for Euclidean algorithm (see Lame's theorem in [Euclidean algorithm](euclid-algorithm.md))\n\n    ## Fibonacci Coding\n\n    We can use the sequence to encode positive integers into binary code words. According to Zeckendorf's theorem, any natural number $n$ can be uniquely represented as a sum of Fibonacci numbers:\n\n    $$N = F_{k_1} + F_{k_2} + \\ldots + F_{k_r}$$\n\n    such that $k_1 \\ge k_2 + 2,\\ k_2 \\ge k_3 + 2,\\  \\ldots,\\  k_r \\ge 2$ (i.e.: the representation cannot use two consecutive Fibonacci numbers).\n\n    It follows that any number can be uniquely encoded in the Fibonacci coding.\n    And we can describe this representation with binary codes $d_0 d_1 d_2 \\dots d_s 1$, where $d_i$ is $1$ if $F_{i+2}$ is used in the representation.\n    The code will be appended by a $1$ do indicate the end of the code word.\n    Notice that this is the only occurrence where two consecutive 1-bits appear.\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    1 &=& 1 &=& F_2 &=& (11)_F \\\\\n    2 &=& 2 &=& F_3 &=& (011)_F \\\\\n    6 &=& 5 + 1 &=& F_5 + F_2 &=& (10011)_F \\\\\n    8 &=& 8 &=& F_6 &=& (000011)_F \\\\\n    9 &=& 8 + 1 &=& F_6 + F_2 &=& (100011)_F \\\\\n    19 &=& 13 + 5 + 1 &=& F_7 + F_5 + F_2 &=& (1001011)_F\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    The encoding of an integer $n$ can be done with a simple greedy algorithm:\n\n    1. Iterate through the Fibonacci numbers from the largest to the smallest until you find one less than or equal to $n$.\n\n    2. Suppose this number was $F_i$. Subtract $F_i$ from $n$ and put a $1$ in the $i-2$ position of the code word (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit).\n\n    3. Repeat until there is no remainder.\n\n    4. Add a final $1$ to the codeword to indicate its end.\n\n    To decode a code word, first remove the final $1$. Then, if the $i$-th bit is set (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit), sum $F_{i+2}$ to the number.\n\n\n    ## Formulas for the $n^{\\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number { data-toc-label=\"Formulas for the <script type='math/tex'>n</script>-th Fibonacci number\" }\n\n    ### Closed-form expression\n\n    There is a formula known as \"Binet's formula\", even though it was already known by Moivre:\n\n    $$F_n = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt{5}}$$\n\n    This formula is easy to prove by induction, but it can be deduced with the help of the concept of generating functions or by solving a functional equation.\n\n    You can immediately notice that the second term's absolute value is always less than $1$, and it also decreases very rapidly (exponentially). Hence the value of the first term alone is \"almost\" $F_n$. This can be written strictly as: \n\n    $$F_n = \\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right]$$\n\n    where the square brackets denote rounding to the nearest integer.\n\n    As these two formulas would require very high accuracy when working with fractional numbers, they are of little use in practical calculations.\n\n    ### Fibonacci in linear time\n\n    The $n$-th Fibonacci number can be easily found in $O(n)$ by computing the numbers one by one up to $n$. However, there are also faster ways, as we will see.\n\n    We can start from an iterative approach, to take advantage of the use of the formula $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, therefore, we will simply precalculate those values in an array. Taking into account the base cases for $F_0$ and $F_1$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_linear}\n    int fib(int n) {\n        int a = 0;\n        int b = 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int tmp = a + b;\n            a = b;\n            b = tmp;\n        }\n        return a;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In this way, we obtain a linear solution, $O(n)$ time, saving all the values prior to $n$ in the sequence.\n\n    ### Matrix form\n\n    It is easy to prove the following relation:\n\n    $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\cr 1 & 0 \\cr\\end{pmatrix} ^ n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_{n} \\cr F_{n} & F_{n-1} \\cr\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n    Thus, in order to find $F_n$ in $O(log  n)$ time, we must raise the matrix to n. (See [Binary exponentiation](binary-exp.md))\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_matrix}\n    struct matrix {\n        long long mat[2][2];\n        matrix friend operator *(const matrix &a, const matrix &b){\n            matrix c;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n              for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {\n                  c.mat[i][j] = 0;\n                  for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {\n                      c.mat[i][j] += a.mat[i][k] * b.mat[k][j];\n                  }\n              }\n            }\n            return c;\n        }\n    };\n\n    matrix matpow(matrix base, long long n) {\n        matrix ans{ {\n          {1, 0},\n          {0, 1}\n        } };\n        while (n) {\n            if(n&1)\n                ans = ans*base;\n            base = base*base;\n            n >>= 1;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n\n    long long fib(int n) {\n        matrix base{ {\n          {1, 1},\n          {1, 0}\n        } };\n        return matpow(base, n).mat[0][1];\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Fast Doubling Method\n\n    Using expanding the above matrix expression for $n = 2\\cdot k$\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    F_{2k+1} & F_{2k}\\\\\n    F_{2k} & F_{2k-1}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    1 & 1\\\\\n    1 & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}^{2k}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    F_{k+1} & F_{k}\\\\\n    F_{k} & F_{k-1}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    ^2\n    $$\n\n    we can find these simpler equations:\n\n    $$ \\begin{align}\n    F_{2k+1} &= F_{k+1}^2 + F_{k}^2 \\\\\n    F_{2k} &= F_k(F_{k+1}+F_{k-1}) = F_k (2F_{k+1} - F_{k})\\\\\n    \\end{align}.$$\n\n    Thus using above two equations Fibonacci numbers can be calculated easily by the following code:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_doubling}\n    pair<int, int> fib (int n) {\n        if (n == 0)\n            return {0, 1};\n\n        auto p = fib(n >> 1);\n        int c = p.first * (2 * p.second - p.first);\n        int d = p.first * p.first + p.second * p.second;\n        if (n & 1)\n            return {d, c + d};\n        else\n            return {c, d};\n    }\n    ```\n    The above code returns $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ as a pair.\n\n    ## Periodicity modulo p\n\n    Consider the Fibonacci sequence modulo $p$. We will prove the sequence is periodic.\n\n    Let us prove this by contradiction. Consider the first $p^2 + 1$ pairs of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo $p$:\n\n    $$(F_0,\\ F_1),\\ (F_1,\\ F_2),\\ \\ldots,\\ (F_{p^2},\\ F_{p^2 + 1})$$\n\n    There can only be $p$ different remainders modulo $p$, and at most $p^2$ different pairs of remainders, so there are at least two identical pairs among them. This is sufficient to prove the sequence is periodic, as a Fibonacci number is only determined by it's two predecessors. Hence if two pairs of consecutive numbers repeat, that would also mean the numbers after the pair will repeat in the same fashion.\n\n    We now choose two pairs of identical remainders with the smallest indices in the sequence. Let the pairs be $(F_a,\\ F_{a + 1})$ and $(F_b,\\ F_{b + 1})$. We will prove that $a = 0$. If this was false, there would be two previous pairs $(F_{a-1},\\ F_a)$ and $(F_{b-1},\\ F_b)$, which, by the property of Fibonacci numbers, would also be equal. However, this contradicts the fact that we had chosen pairs with the smallest indices, completing our proof that there is no pre-period (i.e the numbers are periodic starting from $F_0$).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Catalan Numbers\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Catalan Numbers\n    Catalan numbers is a number sequence, which is found useful in a number of combinatorial problems, often involving recursively-defined objects.\n\n    This sequence was named after the Belgian mathematician [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan), who lived in the 19th century. (In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).\n\n    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):\n\n     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \\ldots$\n\n    ### Application in some combinatorial problems\n\n    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for\n\n    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.\n    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.\n    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.\n    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).\n    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.\n    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).\n    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \\times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).\n    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).\n    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.\n    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \\ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).\n\n\n    ## Calculations\n\n    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.\n\n    ### Recursive formula\n \n    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$\n\n    $$C_n = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \\geq 2$$\n\n    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.\n\n    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :\n\n    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    #### C++ implementation \n\n    ```cpp\n    const int MOD = ....\n    const int MAX = ....\n    int catalan[MAX];\n    void init() {\n        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;\n        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {\n            catalan[i] = 0;\n            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {\n                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;\n                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {\n                    catalan[i] -= MOD;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Analytical formula\n\n    $$C_n = \\frac{1}{n + 1} {\\binom{2n}{n}}$$\n\n    (here $\\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).\n\n    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \\times n$ is given by $\\binom{2n}{n}$.\n\n    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \\times n$.\n\n    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ are $\\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as \"bad\" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above \"bad\" paths, obtaining the formula:\n\n    $$C_n = \\binom{2n}{n} - \\binom{2n}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\binom{2n}{n} , {n} \\geq 0$$\n\n    ## Reference\n\n    - [Catalan Number by Tom Davis](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/catalan.pdf)\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

Specifically, we need to ensure that we are using the values of P(n-1) and P(n-2) as indices correctly.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   The issue arises from the fact that I am using the values of P(n-1) and P(n-2) directly as indices without ensuring that they are valid indices. The values of P(n-1) and P(n-2) should be computed first, and then we should use those computed values to access the correct terms in the sequence.\n\nTo fix this, I will ensure that I correctly compute the values of P(n-1) and P(n-2) before using them as indices to get the correct terms from the sequence.\n\nNow, let's implement the corrected version of the function. \n\n```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    # Handle base cases\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Create a list to store the sequence values\n    P = [0] * (n + 1)\n    P[1] = 1  # First term\n    P[2] = 1  # Second term\n    \n    # Fill the list with the Newman-Conway sequence values\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        # Use the values of P[n-1] and P[n-2] as indices\n        P[i] = P[P[i - 1]] + P[P[i - 2]]\n    \n    # Return the nth term\n    return P[n]\n```\n\nThis implementation should now correctly compute the nth term of the Newman-Conway sequence."

Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Fibonacci Numbers\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Fibonacci Numbers\n\n    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n\n    $$F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$\n\n    The first elements of the sequence ([OEIS A000045](http://oeis.org/A000045)) are:\n\n    $$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$\n\n    ## Properties\n\n    Fibonacci numbers possess a lot of interesting properties. Here are a few of them:\n\n    * Cassini's identity:\n  \n    $$F_{n-1} F_{n+1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n$$\n\n    * The \"addition\" rule:\n  \n    $$F_{n+k} = F_k F_{n+1} + F_{k-1} F_n$$\n\n    * Applying the previous identity to the case $k = n$, we get:\n  \n    $$F_{2n} = F_n (F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})$$\n\n    * From this we can prove by induction that for any positive integer $k$,  $F_{nk}$ is multiple of $F_n$.\n\n    * The inverse is also true: if $F_m$ is multiple of $F_n$, then $m$ is multiple of $n$.\n\n    * GCD identity:\n  \n    $$GCD(F_m, F_n) = F_{GCD(m, n)}$$\n\n    * Fibonacci numbers are the worst possible inputs for Euclidean algorithm (see Lame's theorem in [Euclidean algorithm](euclid-algorithm.md))\n\n    ## Fibonacci Coding\n\n    We can use the sequence to encode positive integers into binary code words. According to Zeckendorf's theorem, any natural number $n$ can be uniquely represented as a sum of Fibonacci numbers:\n\n    $$N = F_{k_1} + F_{k_2} + \\ldots + F_{k_r}$$\n\n    such that $k_1 \\ge k_2 + 2,\\ k_2 \\ge k_3 + 2,\\  \\ldots,\\  k_r \\ge 2$ (i.e.: the representation cannot use two consecutive Fibonacci numbers).\n\n    It follows that any number can be uniquely encoded in the Fibonacci coding.\n    And we can describe this representation with binary codes $d_0 d_1 d_2 \\dots d_s 1$, where $d_i$ is $1$ if $F_{i+2}$ is used in the representation.\n    The code will be appended by a $1$ do indicate the end of the code word.\n    Notice that this is the only occurrence where two consecutive 1-bits appear.\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    1 &=& 1 &=& F_2 &=& (11)_F \\\\\n    2 &=& 2 &=& F_3 &=& (011)_F \\\\\n    6 &=& 5 + 1 &=& F_5 + F_2 &=& (10011)_F \\\\\n    8 &=& 8 &=& F_6 &=& (000011)_F \\\\\n    9 &=& 8 + 1 &=& F_6 + F_2 &=& (100011)_F \\\\\n    19 &=& 13 + 5 + 1 &=& F_7 + F_5 + F_2 &=& (1001011)_F\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    The encoding of an integer $n$ can be done with a simple greedy algorithm:\n\n    1. Iterate through the Fibonacci numbers from the largest to the smallest until you find one less than or equal to $n$.\n\n    2. Suppose this number was $F_i$. Subtract $F_i$ from $n$ and put a $1$ in the $i-2$ position of the code word (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit).\n\n    3. Repeat until there is no remainder.\n\n    4. Add a final $1$ to the codeword to indicate its end.\n\n    To decode a code word, first remove the final $1$. Then, if the $i$-th bit is set (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit), sum $F_{i+2}$ to the number.\n\n\n    ## Formulas for the $n^{\\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number { data-toc-label=\"Formulas for the <script type='math/tex'>n</script>-th Fibonacci number\" }\n\n    ### Closed-form expression\n\n    There is a formula known as \"Binet's formula\", even though it was already known by Moivre:\n\n    $$F_n = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt{5}}$$\n\n    This formula is easy to prove by induction, but it can be deduced with the help of the concept of generating functions or by solving a functional equation.\n\n    You can immediately notice that the second term's absolute value is always less than $1$, and it also decreases very rapidly (exponentially). Hence the value of the first term alone is \"almost\" $F_n$. This can be written strictly as: \n\n    $$F_n = \\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right]$$\n\n    where the square brackets denote rounding to the nearest integer.\n\n    As these two formulas would require very high accuracy when working with fractional numbers, they are of little use in practical calculations.\n\n    ### Fibonacci in linear time\n\n    The $n$-th Fibonacci number can be easily found in $O(n)$ by computing the numbers one by one up to $n$. However, there are also faster ways, as we will see.\n\n    We can start from an iterative approach, to take advantage of the use of the formula $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, therefore, we will simply precalculate those values in an array. Taking into account the base cases for $F_0$ and $F_1$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_linear}\n    int fib(int n) {\n        int a = 0;\n        int b = 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int tmp = a + b;\n            a = b;\n            b = tmp;\n        }\n        return a;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In this way, we obtain a linear solution, $O(n)$ time, saving all the values prior to $n$ in the sequence.\n\n    ### Matrix form\n\n    It is easy to prove the following relation:\n\n    $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\cr 1 & 0 \\cr\\end{pmatrix} ^ n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_{n} \\cr F_{n} & F_{n-1} \\cr\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n    Thus, in order to find $F_n$ in $O(log  n)$ time, we must raise the matrix to n. (See [Binary exponentiation](binary-exp.md))\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_matrix}\n    struct matrix {\n        long long mat[2][2];\n        matrix friend operator *(const matrix &a, const matrix &b){\n            matrix c;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n              for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {\n                  c.mat[i][j] = 0;\n                  for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {\n                      c.mat[i][j] += a.mat[i][k] * b.mat[k][j];\n                  }\n              }\n            }\n            return c;\n        }\n    };\n\n    matrix matpow(matrix base, long long n) {\n        matrix ans{ {\n          {1, 0},\n          {0, 1}\n        } };\n        while (n) {\n            if(n&1)\n                ans = ans*base;\n            base = base*base;\n            n >>= 1;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n\n    long long fib(int n) {\n        matrix base{ {\n          {1, 1},\n          {1, 0}\n        } };\n        return matpow(base, n).mat[0][1];\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Fast Doubling Method\n\n    Using expanding the above matrix expression for $n = 2\\cdot k$\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    F_{2k+1} & F_{2k}\\\\\n    F_{2k} & F_{2k-1}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    1 & 1\\\\\n    1 & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}^{2k}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    F_{k+1} & F_{k}\\\\\n    F_{k} & F_{k-1}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    ^2\n    $$\n\n    we can find these simpler equations:\n\n    $$ \\begin{align}\n    F_{2k+1} &= F_{k+1}^2 + F_{k}^2 \\\\\n    F_{2k} &= F_k(F_{k+1}+F_{k-1}) = F_k (2F_{k+1} - F_{k})\\\\\n    \\end{align}.$$\n\n    Thus using above two equations Fibonacci numbers can be calculated easily by the following code:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_doubling}\n    pair<int, int> fib (int n) {\n        if (n == 0)\n            return {0, 1};\n\n        auto p = fib(n >> 1);\n        int c = p.first * (2 * p.second - p.first);\n        int d = p.first * p.first + p.second * p.second;\n        if (n & 1)\n            return {d, c + d};\n        else\n            return {c, d};\n    }\n    ```\n    The above code returns $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ as a pair.\n\n    ## Periodicity modulo p\n\n    Consider the Fibonacci sequence modulo $p$. We will prove the sequence is periodic.\n\n    Let us prove this by contradiction. Consider the first $p^2 + 1$ pairs of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo $p$:\n\n    $$(F_0,\\ F_1),\\ (F_1,\\ F_2),\\ \\ldots,\\ (F_{p^2},\\ F_{p^2 + 1})$$\n\n    There can only be $p$ different remainders modulo $p$, and at most $p^2$ different pairs of remainders, so there are at least two identical pairs among them. This is sufficient to prove the sequence is periodic, as a Fibonacci number is only determined by it's two predecessors. Hence if two pairs of consecutive numbers repeat, that would also mean the numbers after the pair will repeat in the same fashion.\n\n    We now choose two pairs of identical remainders with the smallest indices in the sequence. Let the pairs be $(F_a,\\ F_{a + 1})$ and $(F_b,\\ F_{b + 1})$. We will prove that $a = 0$. If this was false, there would be two previous pairs $(F_{a-1},\\ F_a)$ and $(F_{b-1},\\ F_b)$, which, by the property of Fibonacci numbers, would also be equal. However, this contradicts the fact that we had chosen pairs with the smallest indices, completing our proof that there is no pre-period (i.e the numbers are periodic starting from $F_0$).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Catalan Numbers\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Catalan Numbers\n    Catalan numbers is a number sequence, which is found useful in a number of combinatorial problems, often involving recursively-defined objects.\n\n    This sequence was named after the Belgian mathematician [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan), who lived in the 19th century. (In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).\n\n    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):\n\n     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \\ldots$\n\n    ### Application in some combinatorial problems\n\n    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for\n\n    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.\n    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.\n    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.\n    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).\n    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.\n    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).\n    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \\times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).\n    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).\n    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.\n    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \\ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).\n\n\n    ## Calculations\n\n    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.\n\n    ### Recursive formula\n \n    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$\n\n    $$C_n = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \\geq 2$$\n\n    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.\n\n    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :\n\n    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    #### C++ implementation \n\n    ```cpp\n    const int MOD = ....\n    const int MAX = ....\n    int catalan[MAX];\n    void init() {\n        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;\n        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {\n            catalan[i] = 0;\n            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {\n                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;\n                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {\n                    catalan[i] -= MOD;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Analytical formula\n\n    $$C_n = \\frac{1}{n + 1} {\\binom{2n}{n}}$$\n\n    (here $\\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).\n\n    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \\times n$ is given by $\\binom{2n}{n}$.\n\n    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \\times n$.\n\n    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ are $\\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as \"bad\" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above \"bad\" paths, obtaining the formula:\n\n    $$C_n = \\binom{2n}{n} - \\binom{2n}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\binom{2n}{n} , {n} \\geq 0$$\n\n    ## Reference\n\n    - [Catalan Number by Tom Davis](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/catalan.pdf)\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Fibonacci Numbers\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Fibonacci Numbers\n\n    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n\n    $$F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$\n\n    The first elements of the sequence ([OEIS A000045](http://oeis.org/A000045)) are:\n\n    $$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$\n\n    ## Properties\n\n    Fibonacci numbers possess a lot of interesting properties. Here are a few of them:\n\n    * Cassini's identity:\n  \n    $$F_{n-1} F_{n+1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n$$\n\n    * The \"addition\" rule:\n  \n    $$F_{n+k} = F_k F_{n+1} + F_{k-1} F_n$$\n\n    * Applying the previous identity to the case $k = n$, we get:\n  \n    $$F_{2n} = F_n (F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})$$\n\n    * From this we can prove by induction that for any positive integer $k$,  $F_{nk}$ is multiple of $F_n$.\n\n    * The inverse is also true: if $F_m$ is multiple of $F_n$, then $m$ is multiple of $n$.\n\n    * GCD identity:\n  \n    $$GCD(F_m, F_n) = F_{GCD(m, n)}$$\n\n    * Fibonacci numbers are the worst possible inputs for Euclidean algorithm (see Lame's theorem in [Euclidean algorithm](euclid-algorithm.md))\n\n    ## Fibonacci Coding\n\n    We can use the sequence to encode positive integers into binary code words. According to Zeckendorf's theorem, any natural number $n$ can be uniquely represented as a sum of Fibonacci numbers:\n\n    $$N = F_{k_1} + F_{k_2} + \\ldots + F_{k_r}$$\n\n    such that $k_1 \\ge k_2 + 2,\\ k_2 \\ge k_3 + 2,\\  \\ldots,\\  k_r \\ge 2$ (i.e.: the representation cannot use two consecutive Fibonacci numbers).\n\n    It follows that any number can be uniquely encoded in the Fibonacci coding.\n    And we can describe this representation with binary codes $d_0 d_1 d_2 \\dots d_s 1$, where $d_i$ is $1$ if $F_{i+2}$ is used in the representation.\n    The code will be appended by a $1$ do indicate the end of the code word.\n    Notice that this is the only occurrence where two consecutive 1-bits appear.\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    1 &=& 1 &=& F_2 &=& (11)_F \\\\\n    2 &=& 2 &=& F_3 &=& (011)_F \\\\\n    6 &=& 5 + 1 &=& F_5 + F_2 &=& (10011)_F \\\\\n    8 &=& 8 &=& F_6 &=& (000011)_F \\\\\n    9 &=& 8 + 1 &=& F_6 + F_2 &=& (100011)_F \\\\\n    19 &=& 13 + 5 + 1 &=& F_7 + F_5 + F_2 &=& (1001011)_F\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    The encoding of an integer $n$ can be done with a simple greedy algorithm:\n\n    1. Iterate through the Fibonacci numbers from the largest to the smallest until you find one less than or equal to $n$.\n\n    2. Suppose this number was $F_i$. Subtract $F_i$ from $n$ and put a $1$ in the $i-2$ position of the code word (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit).\n\n    3. Repeat until there is no remainder.\n\n    4. Add a final $1$ to the codeword to indicate its end.\n\n    To decode a code word, first remove the final $1$. Then, if the $i$-th bit is set (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit), sum $F_{i+2}$ to the number.\n\n\n    ## Formulas for the $n^{\\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number { data-toc-label=\"Formulas for the <script type='math/tex'>n</script>-th Fibonacci number\" }\n\n    ### Closed-form expression\n\n    There is a formula known as \"Binet's formula\", even though it was already known by Moivre:\n\n    $$F_n = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n - \\left(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt{5}}$$\n\n    This formula is easy to prove by induction, but it can be deduced with the help of the concept of generating functions or by solving a functional equation.\n\n    You can immediately notice that the second term's absolute value is always less than $1$, and it also decreases very rapidly (exponentially). Hence the value of the first term alone is \"almost\" $F_n$. This can be written strictly as: \n\n    $$F_n = \\left[\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right]$$\n\n    where the square brackets denote rounding to the nearest integer.\n\n    As these two formulas would require very high accuracy when working with fractional numbers, they are of little use in practical calculations.\n\n    ### Fibonacci in linear time\n\n    The $n$-th Fibonacci number can be easily found in $O(n)$ by computing the numbers one by one up to $n$. However, there are also faster ways, as we will see.\n\n    We can start from an iterative approach, to take advantage of the use of the formula $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, therefore, we will simply precalculate those values in an array. Taking into account the base cases for $F_0$ and $F_1$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_linear}\n    int fib(int n) {\n        int a = 0;\n        int b = 1;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int tmp = a + b;\n            a = b;\n            b = tmp;\n        }\n        return a;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In this way, we obtain a linear solution, $O(n)$ time, saving all the values prior to $n$ in the sequence.\n\n    ### Matrix form\n\n    It is easy to prove the following relation:\n\n    $$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\cr 1 & 0 \\cr\\end{pmatrix} ^ n = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_{n} \\cr F_{n} & F_{n-1} \\cr\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n    Thus, in order to find $F_n$ in $O(log  n)$ time, we must raise the matrix to n. (See [Binary exponentiation](binary-exp.md))\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_matrix}\n    struct matrix {\n        long long mat[2][2];\n        matrix friend operator *(const matrix &a, const matrix &b){\n            matrix c;\n            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\n              for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {\n                  c.mat[i][j] = 0;\n                  for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {\n                      c.mat[i][j] += a.mat[i][k] * b.mat[k][j];\n                  }\n              }\n            }\n            return c;\n        }\n    };\n\n    matrix matpow(matrix base, long long n) {\n        matrix ans{ {\n          {1, 0},\n          {0, 1}\n        } };\n        while (n) {\n            if(n&1)\n                ans = ans*base;\n            base = base*base;\n            n >>= 1;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n\n    long long fib(int n) {\n        matrix base{ {\n          {1, 1},\n          {1, 0}\n        } };\n        return matpow(base, n).mat[0][1];\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Fast Doubling Method\n\n    Using expanding the above matrix expression for $n = 2\\cdot k$\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    F_{2k+1} & F_{2k}\\\\\n    F_{2k} & F_{2k-1}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    1 & 1\\\\\n    1 & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}^{2k}\n    =\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n    F_{k+1} & F_{k}\\\\\n    F_{k} & F_{k-1}\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    ^2\n    $$\n\n    we can find these simpler equations:\n\n    $$ \\begin{align}\n    F_{2k+1} &= F_{k+1}^2 + F_{k}^2 \\\\\n    F_{2k} &= F_k(F_{k+1}+F_{k-1}) = F_k (2F_{k+1} - F_{k})\\\\\n    \\end{align}.$$\n\n    Thus using above two equations Fibonacci numbers can be calculated easily by the following code:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_doubling}\n    pair<int, int> fib (int n) {\n        if (n == 0)\n            return {0, 1};\n\n        auto p = fib(n >> 1);\n        int c = p.first * (2 * p.second - p.first);\n        int d = p.first * p.first + p.second * p.second;\n        if (n & 1)\n            return {d, c + d};\n        else\n            return {c, d};\n    }\n    ```\n    The above code returns $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ as a pair.\n\n    ## Periodicity modulo p\n\n    Consider the Fibonacci sequence modulo $p$. We will prove the sequence is periodic.\n\n    Let us prove this by contradiction. Consider the first $p^2 + 1$ pairs of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo $p$:\n\n    $$(F_0,\\ F_1),\\ (F_1,\\ F_2),\\ \\ldots,\\ (F_{p^2},\\ F_{p^2 + 1})$$\n\n    There can only be $p$ different remainders modulo $p$, and at most $p^2$ different pairs of remainders, so there are at least two identical pairs among them. This is sufficient to prove the sequence is periodic, as a Fibonacci number is only determined by it's two predecessors. Hence if two pairs of consecutive numbers repeat, that would also mean the numbers after the pair will repeat in the same fashion.\n\n    We now choose two pairs of identical remainders with the smallest indices in the sequence. Let the pairs be $(F_a,\\ F_{a + 1})$ and $(F_b,\\ F_{b + 1})$. We will prove that $a = 0$. If this was false, there would be two previous pairs $(F_{a-1},\\ F_a)$ and $(F_{b-1},\\ F_b)$, which, by the property of Fibonacci numbers, would also be equal. However, this contradicts the fact that we had chosen pairs with the smallest indices, completing our proof that there is no pre-period (i.e the numbers are periodic starting from $F_0$).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Catalan Numbers\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Catalan Numbers\n    Catalan numbers is a number sequence, which is found useful in a number of combinatorial problems, often involving recursively-defined objects.\n\n    This sequence was named after the Belgian mathematician [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan), who lived in the 19th century. (In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).\n\n    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):\n\n     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \\ldots$\n\n    ### Application in some combinatorial problems\n\n    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for\n\n    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.\n    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.\n    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.\n    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).\n    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.\n    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).\n    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \\times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).\n    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).\n    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.\n    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \\ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).\n\n\n    ## Calculations\n\n    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.\n\n    ### Recursive formula\n \n    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$\n\n    $$C_n = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \\geq 2$$\n\n    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.\n\n    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :\n\n    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    #### C++ implementation \n\n    ```cpp\n    const int MOD = ....\n    const int MAX = ....\n    int catalan[MAX];\n    void init() {\n        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;\n        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {\n            catalan[i] = 0;\n            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {\n                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;\n                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {\n                    catalan[i] -= MOD;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Analytical formula\n\n    $$C_n = \\frac{1}{n + 1} {\\binom{2n}{n}}$$\n\n    (here $\\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).\n\n    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \\times n$ is given by $\\binom{2n}{n}$.\n\n    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \\times n$.\n\n    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ are $\\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as \"bad\" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above \"bad\" paths, obtaining the formula:\n\n    $$C_n = \\binom{2n}{n} - \\binom{2n}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\binom{2n}{n} , {n} \\geq 0$$\n\n    ## Reference\n\n    - [Catalan Number by Tom Davis](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/catalan.pdf)\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

Specifically, we need to ensure that we are using the values of P(n-1) and P(n-2) correctly.\n\n### Correct Implementation\nHere is the corrected implementation of the Newman-Conway sequence:\n\n```python\ndef sequence(n):\n    # Handle base cases\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Create a list to store the sequence values\n    P = [0] * (n + 1)\n    P[1] = 1  # First term\n    P[2] = 1  # Second term\n    \n    # Fill the list with the Newman-Conway sequence values\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        # Correctly compute P(n) using the values of P(n-1) and P(n-2) as indices\n        P[i] = P[P[i - 1]] + P[P[i - 2]]\n    \n    # Return the nth term\n    return P[n]\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n1. **Base Cases**: The function first checks if n is 1 or 2 and returns 1 for both cases.\n2. **List Initialization**: A list `P` is created to store the sequence values, initialized with zeros.\n3. **Filling the Sequence**: A loop runs from 3 to n, calculating each term based on the previous terms using the recursive definition.\n4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the nth term of the sequence.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly compute the nth term of the Newman-Conway sequence."
