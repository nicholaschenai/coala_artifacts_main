    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the nth centered hexagonal number. The centered hexagonal numbers are a sequence of numbers that can be represented in a hexagonal pattern, and the nth number in this sequence is what we need to compute.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The formula for the nth centered hexagonal number can be derived from the pattern of these numbers. The nth centered hexagonal number can be calculated using the formula:\n   \\[\n   H(n) = 3n(n - 1) + 1\n   \\]\n   This formula arises from the observation that each centered hexagonal number can be constructed by adding layers of hexagons around a central point.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function centered_hexagonal_number(n):\n       return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Function to calculate the nth centered hexagonal number\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # The formula for the nth centered hexagonal number is:\n    # H(n) = 3n(n - 1) + 1\n    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n```",
