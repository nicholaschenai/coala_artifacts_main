    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns them in reverse order as a tuple. For example, if the input is 10 and 20, the output should be (20, 10).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: The solution involves defining a function that accepts two parameters. Inside the function, we will create a tuple that contains the second parameter first, followed by the first parameter. Finally, we will return this tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   Function swap_numbers(first_number, second_number):\n       Create a tuple with second_number and first_number\n       Return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function that takes two numbers as input\ndef swap_numbers(first_number, second_number):\n    # Create a tuple with the second number first and the first number second\n    result = (second_number, first_number)\n    # Return the created tuple\n    return result\n```",
