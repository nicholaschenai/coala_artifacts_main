    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that finds the second smallest number in a given list of integers. The function should return this second smallest number.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To find the second smallest number in a list, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, we need to identify the smallest number in the list.\n   - Then, we can iterate through the list again to find the smallest number that is greater than the smallest number identified in the first step.\n   - This will give us the second smallest number.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function second_smallest(numbers):\n       if the list is empty or has only one element:\n           return None (or some indication of invalid input)\n       smallest = infinity\n       second_smallest = infinity\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number < smallest:\n               second_smallest = smallest\n               smallest = number\n           else if number < second_smallest and number != smallest:\n               second_smallest = number\n       \n       if second_smallest is still infinity:\n           return None (or some indication that there is no second smallest)\n       return second_smallest\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    # Initialize the smallest and second smallest to a large value\n    smallest = float('inf')\n    second_smallest = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through the list to find the smallest and second smallest\n    for number in numbers:\n        if number < smallest:\n            second_smallest = smallest  # Update second smallest\n            smallest = number  # Update smallest\n        elif number < second_smallest and number != smallest:\n            second_smallest = number  # Update second smallest if it's not equal to smallest\n    \n    # If second_smallest is still infinity, it means there was no second smallest\n    if second_smallest == float('inf'):\n        return None  # or some indication of invalid input\n    \n    return second_smallest  # Return the second smallest number\n```",
