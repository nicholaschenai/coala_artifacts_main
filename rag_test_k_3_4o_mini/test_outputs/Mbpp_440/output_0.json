    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that identifies the first adverb in a given sentence and returns its position along with the adverb itself. An adverb is defined as a word that typically modifies a verb, adjective, or other adverbs, and in this case, we will consider any word that ends with \"ly\" as an adverb.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Split the input sentence into individual words.\n   - Iterate through the list of words to find the first one that ends with \"ly\".\n   - If we find such a word, we will return its starting index in the sentence, its ending index, and the word itself.\n   - If no adverb is found, we will return a suitable indication (though the problem does not specify what to return in this case).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_adverb_position(sentence):\n       split the sentence into words\n       for each word in words:\n           if the word ends with \"ly\":\n               calculate the starting index of the word in the sentence\n               calculate the ending index of the word in the sentence\n               return (starting index, ending index, word)\n       return None (or some indication of no adverb found)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word ends with \"ly\"\n        if word.endswith(\"ly\"):\n            # Calculate the starting index of the word in the sentence\n            start_index = sentence.index(word)\n            # Calculate the ending index of the word in the sentence\n            end_index = start_index + len(word) - 1\n            # Return the indices and the word\n            return (start_index, end_index, word)\n    \n    # If no adverb is found, return None (not specified in the problem)\n    return None\n\n```",
