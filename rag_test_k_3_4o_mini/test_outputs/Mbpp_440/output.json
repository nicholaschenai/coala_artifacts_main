    "raw_msg": "Let's revisit the code to ensure it correctly identifies the first adverb in the sentence and returns the correct indices. The previous attempts had issues with calculating the ending index correctly. \n\n### Key Points to Address:\n1. **Ending Index Calculation**: The ending index should be calculated based on the original word's length, not the cleaned version.\n2. **Handling Punctuation**: We need to ensure that we correctly identify the word without punctuation affecting the index calculations.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n- We will iterate through the words in the sentence.\n- For each word, we will check if it ends with \"ly\".\n- If it does, we will calculate the starting index using the original word and the ending index based on the original word's length.\n- We will return the starting index, ending index, and the cleaned word.\n\nHere\u2019s the corrected implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word ends with \"ly\"\n        if word.endswith(\"ly\"):\n            # Calculate the starting index of the word in the sentence\n            start_index = sentence.index(word)\n            # Calculate the ending index of the original word in the sentence\n            end_index = start_index + len(word) - 1\n            # Return the indices and the original word\n            return (start_index, end_index, word)\n    \n    # If no adverb is found, return None (not specified in the problem)\n    return None\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- The code now directly checks if the original word ends with \"ly\" without stripping punctuation for the index calculations.\n- The starting and ending indices are calculated based on the original word, ensuring that the output matches the expected format.\n\nThis implementation should now correctly identify the first adverb in the sentence and return the correct indices.",
