In some cases, this allows one to perform geometric operations without resorting to real numbers at all.\n\n    However, there is a small drawback: for the same straight line different triples of coefficients can be obtained.\n    To avoid this, but do not go away from the integer coefficients, you can apply the following technique, often called **rationing**. Find the [greatest common divisor](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md) of numbers $| A | , | B | , | C |$ , we divide all three coefficients by it, and then we make the normalization of the sign: if $A <0$ or $A = 0, B <0$ then multiply all three coefficients by $-1$ .\n    As a result, we will come to the conclusion that for identical straight lines, identical triples of coefficients will be obtained, which makes it easy to check straight lines for equality.\n\n    ### Real case\n\n    When working with real numbers, you should always be aware of errors.\n\n    The coefficients $A$ and $B$ will have the order of the original coordinates, the coefficient $C$ is of the order of the square of them. This may already be quite large numbers, and, for example, when we [intersect straight lines](lines-intersection.md), they will become even larger, which can lead to large rounding errors already when the coordinates of the end points are of order $10^3$.\n\n    Therefore, when working with real numbers, it is desirable to produce the so-called **normalization**, this is straightforward: namely, to make the coefficients such that $A ^ 2 + B ^ 2 = 1$ . To do this, calculate the number $Z$ :\n\n    $$Z = \\sqrt{A ^ 2 + B ^ 2},$$\n\n    and divide all three coefficients $A , B , C$ by it.\n\n    Thus, the order of the coefficients $A$ and $B$ will not depend on the order of the input coordinates, and the coefficient $C$ will be of the same order as the input coordinates. In practice, this leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of calculations.\n\n    Finally, we mention the **comparison** of straight lines - in fact, after such a normalization, for the same straight line, only two triples of coefficients can be obtained: up to multiplication by $-1$.\n    Accordingly, if we make an additional normalization taking into account the sign (if $A < -\\varepsilon$  or $| A | < \\varepsilon$, $B <- \\varepsilon$ then multiply by $-1$ ), the resulting coefficients will be unique.\n\n    ### Three-dimensional and multidimensional case\n\n    Already in the three-dimensional case there is **no simple equation** describing a straight line (it can be defined as the intersection of two planes, that is, a system of two equations, but this is an inconvenient method).\n\n    Consequently, in the three-dimensional and multidimensional cases we must use the **parametric method of defining a straight line** , i.e. as a point $p$ and a vector $v$ :\n\n    $$p + v t, ~~~ t \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\n\n    Those. a straight line is all points that can be obtained from a point $p$ adding a vector $v$ with an arbitrary coefficient.\n\n    The **construction** of a straight line in a parametric form along the coordinates of the ends of a segment is trivial, we just take one end of the segment for the point $p$, and the vector from the first to the second end \u2014 for the vector $v$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Finding repetitions\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Finding repetitions\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n\n    A **repetition** is two occurrences of a string in a row.\n    In other words a repetition can be described by a pair of indices $i < j$ such that the substring $s[i \\dots j]$ consists of two identical strings written after each other.\n\n    The challenge is to **find all repetitions** in a given string $s$.\n    Or a simplified task: find **any** repetition or find the **longest** repetition.\n\n    The algorithm described here was published in 1982 by Main and Lorentz.\n\n    ## Example\n\n    Consider the repetitions in the following example string:\n\n    $$acababaee$$\n\n    The string contains the following three repetitions:\n\n    - $s[2 \\dots 5] = abab$\n    - $s[3 \\dots 6] = baba$\n    - $s[7 \\dots 7] = ee$\n\n    Another example:\n\n    $$abaaba$$\n\n    Here there are only two repetitions\n\n    - $s[0 \\dots 5] = abaaba$\n    - $s[2 \\dots 3] = aa$\n\n    ## Number of repetitions\n\n    In general there can be up to $O(n^2)$ repetitions in a string of length $n$.\n    An obvious example is a string consisting of $n$ times the same letter, in this case any substring of even length is a repetition.\n    In general any periodic string with a short period will contain a lot of repetitions.\n\n    On the other hand this fact does not prevent computing the number of repetitions in $O(n \\log n)$ time, because the algorithm can give the repetitions in compressed form, in groups of several pieces at once.\n\n    There is even the concept, that describes groups of periodic substrings with tuples of size four.\n    It has been proven that we the number of such groups is at most linear with respect to the string length.\n\n    Also, here are some more interesting results related to the number of repetitions:\n\n      - The number of primitive repetitions (those whose halves are not repetitions) is at most $O(n \\log n)$.\n      - If we encode repetitions with tuples of numbers (called Crochemore triples) $(i,~ p,~ r)$ (where $i$ is the position of the beginning, $p$ the length of the repeating substring, and $r$ the number of repetitions), then all repetitions can be described with $O(n \\log n)$ such triples.\n      - Fibonacci strings, defined as \n    \n        \\[\\begin{align}\n        t_0 &= a, \\\\\\\\\n        t_1 &= b, \\\\\\\\\n        t_i &= t_{i-1} + t_{i-2},\n        \\end{align}\\]\n    \n        are \"strongly\" periodic.\n        The number of repetitions in the Fibonacci string $f_i$, even in the compressed with Crochemore triples, is $O(f_n \\log f_n)$.\n        The number of primitive repetitions is also $O(f_n \\log f_n)$.\n\n    ## Main-Lorentz algorithm\n\n    The idea behind the Main-Lorentz algorithm is **divide-and-conquer**.\n\n    It splits the initial string into halves, and computes the number of repetitions that lie completely in each halve by two recursive calls.\n    Then comes the difficult part.\n    The algorithm finds all repetitions starting in the first half and ending in the second half (which we will call **crossing repetitions**).\n    This is the essential part of the Main-Lorentz algorithm, and we will discuss it in detail here.\n\n    The complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms is well researched.\n    The [master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)) says, that we will end up with an $O(n \\log n)$ algorithm, if we can compute the crossing repetitions in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    ### Search for crossing repetitions\n\n    So we want to find all such repetitions that start in the first half of the string, let's call it $u$, and end in the second half, let's call it $v$:\n\n    $$s = u + v$$\n\n    Their lengths are approximately equal to the length of $s$ divided by two.\n\n    Consider an arbitrary repetition and look at the middle character (more precisely the first character of the second half of the repetition).\n    I.e. if the repetition is a substring $s[i \\dots j]$, then the middle character is $(i + j + 1) / 2$.\n\n    We call a repetition **left** or **right** depending on which string this character is located - in the string $u$ or in the string $v$.\n    In other words a string is called left, if the majority of it lies in $u$, otherwise we call it right.\n\n    We will now discuss how to find **all left repetitions**.\n    Finding all right repetitions can be done in the same way.\n\n    Let us denote the length of the left repetition by $2l$ (i.e. each half of the repetition has length $l$).\n    Consider the first character of the repetition falling into the string $v$ (it is at position $|u|$ in the string $s$).\n    It coincides with the character $l$ positions before it, let's denote this position $cntr$.\n\n    We will fixate this position $cntr$, and **look for all repetitions at this position** $cntr$.\n\n    For example:\n\n    $$c ~ \\underset{cntr}{a} ~ c ~ | ~ a ~ d ~ a$$\n\n    The vertical lines divides the two halves.\n    Here we fixated the position $cntr = 1$, and at this position we find the repetition $caca$.\n\n    It is clear, that if we fixate the position $cntr$, we simultaneously fixate the length of the possible repetitions: $l = |u| - cntr$.\n    Once we know how to find these repetitions, we will iterate over all possible values for $cntr$ from $0$ to $|u|-1$, and find all left crossover repetitions of length $l = |u|,~ |u|-1,~ \\dots, 1$.\n\n    ### Criterion for left crossing repetitions\n\n    Now, how can we find all such repetitions for a fixated $cntr$?\n    Keep in mind that there still can be multiple such repetitions.\n\n    Let's again look at a visualization, this time for the repetition $abcabc$:\n\n    $$\\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ \\overbrace{\\underset{cntr}{b} ~ c}^{l_2} ~ \\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ | ~ \\overbrace{b ~ c}^{l_2}$$\n\n    Here we denoted the lengths of the two pieces of the repetition with $l_1$ and $l_2$:\n    $l_1$ is the length of the repetition up to the position $cntr-1$, and $l_2$ is the length of the repetition from $cntr$ to the end of the half of the repetition.\n    We have $2l = l_1 + l_2 + l_1 + l_2$ as the total length of the repetition.\n\n    Let us generate **necessary and sufficient** conditions for such a repetition at position $cntr$ of length $2l = 2(l_1 + l_2) = 2(|u| - cntr)$:\n\n    - Let $k_1$ be the largest number such that the first $k_1$ characters before the position $cntr$ coincide with the last $k_1$ characters in the string $u$:\n  \n    $$\n    u[cntr - k_1 \\dots cntr - 1] = u[|u| - k_1 \\dots |u| - 1]\n    $$\n  \n    - Let $k_2$ be the largest number such that the $k_2$ characters starting at position $cntr$ coincide with the first $k_2$ characters in the string $v$:\n\n    $$  \n      u[cntr \\dots cntr + k_2 - 1] = v[0 \\dots k_2 - 1]\n    $$\n  \n    - Then we have a repetition exactly for any pair $(l_1,~ l_2)$ with\n\n    $$\n      \\begin{align}\n      l_1 &\\le k_1, \\\\\\\\\n      l_2 &\\le k_2. \\\\\\\\\n      \\end{align}\n    $$\n\n    To summarize:\n\n    - We fixate a specific position $cntr$.\n    - All repetition which we will find now have length $2l = 2(|u| - cntr)$.\n      There might be multiple such repetitions, they depend on the lengths $l_1$ and $l_2 = l - l_1$.\n    - We find $k_1$ and $k_2$ as described above.\n    - Then all suitable repetitions are the ones for which the lengths of the pieces $l_1$ and $l_2$ satisfy the conditions:\n\n    $$\n      \\begin{align}\n      l_1 + l_2 &= l = |u| - cntr \\\\\\\\\n      l_1 &\\le k_1, \\\\\\\\\n      l_2 &\\le k_2. \\\\\\\\\n      \\end{align}\n    $$\n\n    Therefore the only remaining part is how we can compute the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ quickly for every position $cntr$.\n    Luckily we can compute them in $O(1)$ using the [Z-function](../string/z-function.md):\n\n    - To can find the value $k_1$ for each position by calculating the Z-function for the string $\\overline{u}$ (i.e. the reversed string $u$).\n      Then the value $k_1$ for a particular $cntr$ will be equal to the corresponding value of the array of the Z-function.\n    - To precompute all values $k_2$, we calculate the Z-function for the string $v + \\# + u$ (i.e. the string $u$ concatenated with the separator character $\\#$ and the string $v$).\n      Again we just need to look up the corresponding value in the Z-function to get the $k_2$ value.\n\n    So this is enough to find all left crossing repetitions.\n\n    ### Right crossing repetitions\n\n    For computing the right crossing repetitions we act similarly:\n    we define the center $cntr$ as the character corresponding to the last character in the string $u$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

This indicates that the function is not correctly identifying the word \"clearly\" as an adverb.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Logic**:\n   - The function splits the sentence into words correctly.\n   - It checks if each word ends with \"ly\", which is correct.\n   - However, the method used to find the starting index of the word in the sentence (`sentence.index(word)`) can lead to issues if the word appears multiple times or if there are punctuation marks attached to the word.\n\n4. **Where I Went Wrong**: \n   - The `index` method does not account for punctuation. In the input \"clearly!!\", the word \"clearly\" is followed by punctuation, which means the split will not yield \"clearly\" as a standalone word.\n   - The function needs to handle punctuation and ensure that it checks the correct form of the word.\n\n5. **Next Steps**: \n   - I will modify the code to strip punctuation from the words before checking if they end with \"ly\".\n   - I will also ensure that the starting and ending indices are calculated correctly based on the original sentence.\n\nNow, I will implement these changes in the code. \n\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Strip punctuation from the word\n        clean_word = ''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum() or char == 'y')\n        \n        # Check if the cleaned word ends with \"ly\"\n        if clean_word.endswith(\"ly\"):\n            # Calculate the starting index of the word in the sentence\n            start_index = sentence.index(word)\n            # Calculate the ending index of the word in the sentence\n            end_index = start_index + len(clean_word) - 1\n            # Return the indices and the cleaned word\n            return (start_index, end_index, clean_word)\n    \n    # If no adverb is found, return None (not specified in the problem)\n    return None\n```"

$s[j] = s[k]$: if this is the case, then adding the symbol $s[j]$ to $s_2$ doesn't violate its pre-simplicity.\n      So we simply increment the pointers $j$ and $k$.\n    - $s[j] > s[k]$: here, the string $s_2 + s[j]$ becomes simple.\n      We can increment $j$ and reset $k$ back to the beginning of $s_2$, so that the next character can be compared with the beginning of the simple word.\n    - $s[j] < s[k]$: the string $s_2 + s[j]$ is no longer pre-simple.\n      Therefore we will split the pre-simple string $s_2$ into its simple strings and the remainder, possibly empty.\n      The simple string will have the length $j - k$.\n      In the next iteration we start again with the remaining $s_2$.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here we present the implementation of the Duval algorithm, which will return the desired Lyndon factorization of a given string $s$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=duval_algorithm}\n    vector<string> duval(string const& s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int i = 0;\n        vector<string> factorization;\n        while (i < n) {\n            int j = i + 1, k = i;\n            while (j < n && s[k] <= s[j]) {\n                if (s[k] < s[j])\n                    k = i;\n                else\n                    k++;\n                j++;\n            }\n            while (i <= k) {\n                factorization.push_back(s.substr(i, j - k));\n                i += j - k;\n            }\n        }\n        return factorization;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Complexity\n\n    Let us estimate the running time of this algorithm.\n\n    The **outer while loop** does not exceed $n$ iterations, since at the end of each iteration $i$ increases.\n    Also the second inner while loop runs in $O(n)$, since is only outputs the final factorization.\n\n    So we are only interested in the **first inner while loop**.\n    How many iterations does it perform in the worst case?\n    It's easy to see that the simple words that we identify in each iteration of the outer loop are longer than the remainder that we additionally compared.\n    Therefore also the sum of the remainders will be smaller than $n$, which means that we only perform at most $O(n)$ iterations of the first inner while loop.\n    In fact the total number of character comparisons will not exceed $4n - 3$.\n\n    ## Finding the smallest cyclic shift\n\n    Let there be a string $s$.\n    We construct the Lyndon factorization for the string $s + s$ (in $O(n)$ time).\n    We will look for a simple string in the factorization, which starts at a position less than $n$ (i.e. it starts in the first instance of $s$), and ends in a position greater than or equal to $n$ (i.e. in the second instance) of $s$).\n    It is stated, that the position of the start of this simple string will be the beginning of the desired smallest cyclic shift.\n    This can be easily verified using the definition of the Lyndon decomposition.\n\n    The beginning of the simple block can be found easily - just remember the pointer $i$ at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop, which indicated the beginning of the current pre-simple string.\n\n    So we get the following implementation:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=smallest_cyclic_string}\n    string min_cyclic_string(string s) {\n        s += s;\n        int n = s.size();\n        int i = 0, ans = 0;\n        while (i < n / 2) {\n            ans = i;\n            int j = i + 1, k = i;\n            while (j < n && s[k] <= s[j]) {\n                if (s[k] < s[j])\n                    k = i;\n                else\n                    k++;\n                j++;\n            }\n            while (i <= k)\n                i += j - k;\n        }\n        return s.substr(ans, n / 2);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Finding repetitions\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Finding repetitions\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n\n    A **repetition** is two occurrences of a string in a row.\n    In other words a repetition can be described by a pair of indices $i < j$ such that the substring $s[i \\dots j]$ consists of two identical strings written after each other.\n\n    The challenge is to **find all repetitions** in a given string $s$.\n    Or a simplified task: find **any** repetition or find the **longest** repetition.\n\n    The algorithm described here was published in 1982 by Main and Lorentz.\n\n    ## Example\n\n    Consider the repetitions in the following example string:\n\n    $$acababaee$$\n\n    The string contains the following three repetitions:\n\n    - $s[2 \\dots 5] = abab$\n    - $s[3 \\dots 6] = baba$\n    - $s[7 \\dots 7] = ee$\n\n    Another example:\n\n    $$abaaba$$\n\n    Here there are only two repetitions\n\n    - $s[0 \\dots 5] = abaaba$\n    - $s[2 \\dots 3] = aa$\n\n    ## Number of repetitions\n\n    In general there can be up to $O(n^2)$ repetitions in a string of length $n$.\n    An obvious example is a string consisting of $n$ times the same letter, in this case any substring of even length is a repetition.\n    In general any periodic string with a short period will contain a lot of repetitions.\n\n    On the other hand this fact does not prevent computing the number of repetitions in $O(n \\log n)$ time, because the algorithm can give the repetitions in compressed form, in groups of several pieces at once.\n\n    There is even the concept, that describes groups of periodic substrings with tuples of size four.\n    It has been proven that we the number of such groups is at most linear with respect to the string length.\n\n    Also, here are some more interesting results related to the number of repetitions:\n\n      - The number of primitive repetitions (those whose halves are not repetitions) is at most $O(n \\log n)$.\n      - If we encode repetitions with tuples of numbers (called Crochemore triples) $(i,~ p,~ r)$ (where $i$ is the position of the beginning, $p$ the length of the repeating substring, and $r$ the number of repetitions), then all repetitions can be described with $O(n \\log n)$ such triples.\n      - Fibonacci strings, defined as \n    \n        \\[\\begin{align}\n        t_0 &= a, \\\\\\\\\n        t_1 &= b, \\\\\\\\\n        t_i &= t_{i-1} + t_{i-2},\n        \\end{align}\\]\n    \n        are \"strongly\" periodic.\n        The number of repetitions in the Fibonacci string $f_i$, even in the compressed with Crochemore triples, is $O(f_n \\log f_n)$.\n        The number of primitive repetitions is also $O(f_n \\log f_n)$.\n\n    ## Main-Lorentz algorithm\n\n    The idea behind the Main-Lorentz algorithm is **divide-and-conquer**.\n\n    It splits the initial string into halves, and computes the number of repetitions that lie completely in each halve by two recursive calls.\n    Then comes the difficult part.\n    The algorithm finds all repetitions starting in the first half and ending in the second half (which we will call **crossing repetitions**).\n    This is the essential part of the Main-Lorentz algorithm, and we will discuss it in detail here.\n\n    The complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms is well researched.\n    The [master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)) says, that we will end up with an $O(n \\log n)$ algorithm, if we can compute the crossing repetitions in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    ### Search for crossing repetitions\n\n    So we want to find all such repetitions that start in the first half of the string, let's call it $u$, and end in the second half, let's call it $v$:\n\n    $$s = u + v$$\n\n    Their lengths are approximately equal to the length of $s$ divided by two.\n\n    Consider an arbitrary repetition and look at the middle character (more precisely the first character of the second half of the repetition).\n    I.e. if the repetition is a substring $s[i \\dots j]$, then the middle character is $(i + j + 1) / 2$.\n\n    We call a repetition **left** or **right** depending on which string this character is located - in the string $u$ or in the string $v$.\n    In other words a string is called left, if the majority of it lies in $u$, otherwise we call it right.\n\n    We will now discuss how to find **all left repetitions**.\n    Finding all right repetitions can be done in the same way.\n\n    Let us denote the length of the left repetition by $2l$ (i.e. each half of the repetition has length $l$).\n    Consider the first character of the repetition falling into the string $v$ (it is at position $|u|$ in the string $s$).\n    It coincides with the character $l$ positions before it, let's denote this position $cntr$.\n\n    We will fixate this position $cntr$, and **look for all repetitions at this position** $cntr$.\n\n    For example:\n\n    $$c ~ \\underset{cntr}{a} ~ c ~ | ~ a ~ d ~ a$$\n\n    The vertical lines divides the two halves.\n    Here we fixated the position $cntr = 1$, and at this position we find the repetition $caca$.\n\n    It is clear, that if we fixate the position $cntr$, we simultaneously fixate the length of the possible repetitions: $l = |u| - cntr$.\n    Once we know how to find these repetitions, we will iterate over all possible values for $cntr$ from $0$ to $|u|-1$, and find all left crossover repetitions of length $l = |u|,~ |u|-1,~ \\dots, 1$.\n\n    ### Criterion for left crossing repetitions\n\n    Now, how can we find all such repetitions for a fixated $cntr$?\n    Keep in mind that there still can be multiple such repetitions.\n\n    Let's again look at a visualization, this time for the repetition $abcabc$:\n\n    $$\\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ \\overbrace{\\underset{cntr}{b} ~ c}^{l_2} ~ \\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ | ~ \\overbrace{b ~ c}^{l_2}$$\n\n    Here we denoted the lengths of the two pieces of the repetition with $l_1$ and $l_2$:\n    $l_1$ is the length of the repetition up to the position $cntr-1$, and $l_2$ is the length of the repetition from $cntr$ to the end of the half of the repetition.\n    We have $2l = l_1 + l_2 + l_1 + l_2$ as the total length of the repetition.\n\n    Let us generate **necessary and sufficient** conditions for such a repetition at position $cntr$ of length $2l = 2(l_1 + l_2) = 2(|u| - cntr)$:\n\n    - Let $k_1$ be the largest number such that the first $k_1$ characters before the position $cntr$ coincide with the last $k_1$ characters in the string $u$:\n  \n    $$\n    u[cntr - k_1 \\dots cntr - 1] = u[|u| - k_1 \\dots |u| - 1]\n    $$\n  \n    - Let $k_2$ be the largest number such that the $k_2$ characters starting at position $cntr$ coincide with the first $k_2$ characters in the string $v$:\n\n    $$  \n      u[cntr \\dots cntr + k_2 - 1] = v[0 \\dots k_2 - 1]\n    $$\n  \n    - Then we have a repetition exactly for any pair $(l_1,~ l_2)$ with\n\n    $$\n      \\begin{align}\n      l_1 &\\le k_1, \\\\\\\\\n      l_2 &\\le k_2. \\\\\\\\\n      \\end{align}\n    $$\n\n    To summarize:\n\n    - We fixate a specific position $cntr$.\n    - All repetition which we will find now have length $2l = 2(|u| - cntr)$.\n      There might be multiple such repetitions, they depend on the lengths $l_1$ and $l_2 = l - l_1$.\n    - We find $k_1$ and $k_2$ as described above.\n    - Then all suitable repetitions are the ones for which the lengths of the pieces $l_1$ and $l_2$ satisfy the conditions:\n\n    $$\n      \\begin{align}\n      l_1 + l_2 &= l = |u| - cntr \\\\\\\\\n      l_1 &\\le k_1, \\\\\\\\\n      l_2 &\\le k_2. \\\\\\\\\n      \\end{align}\n    $$\n\n    Therefore the only remaining part is how we can compute the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ quickly for every position $cntr$.\n    Luckily we can compute them in $O(1)$ using the [Z-function](../string/z-function.md):\n\n    - To can find the value $k_1$ for each position by calculating the Z-function for the string $\\overline{u}$ (i.e. the reversed string $u$).\n      Then the value $k_1$ for a particular $cntr$ will be equal to the corresponding value of the array of the Z-function.\n    - To precompute all values $k_2$, we calculate the Z-function for the string $v + \\# + u$ (i.e. the string $u$ concatenated with the separator character $\\#$ and the string $v$).\n      Again we just need to look up the corresponding value in the Z-function to get the $k_2$ value.\n\n    So this is enough to find all left crossing repetitions.\n\n    ### Right crossing repetitions\n\n    For computing the right crossing repetitions we act similarly:\n    we define the center $cntr$ as the character corresponding to the last character in the string $u$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Games on arbitrary graphs\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n\n    ## Example: \"Policeman and thief\"\n\n    Here is a concrete example of such a game.\n\n    There is $m \\times n$ board.\n    Some of the cells cannot be entered.\n    The initial coordinates of the police officer and of the thief are known.\n    One of the cells is the exit.\n    If the policeman and the thief are located at the same cell at any moment, the policeman wins.\n    If the thief is at the exit cell (without the policeman also being on the cell), then the thief wins.\n    The policeman can walk in all 8 directions, the thief only in 4 (along the coordinate axis).\n    Both the policeman and the thief will take turns moving.\n    However they also can skip a turn if they want to.\n    The first move is made by the policeman.\n\n    We will now **construct the graph**.\n    For this we must formalize the rules of the game.\n    The current state of the game is determined by the coordinates of the police offices $P$, the coordinates of the thief $T$, and also by whose turn it is, let's call this variable $P_{\\text{turn}}$ (which is true when it is the policeman's turn).\n    Therefore a vertex of the graph is determined by the triple $(P, T, P_{\\text{turn}})$\n    The graph then can be easily constructed, simply by following the rules of the game.\n\n    Next we need to determine which vertices are winning and which are losing ones initially.\n    There is a **subtle point** here.\n    The winning / losing vertices depend, in addition to the coordinates, also on $P_{\\text{turn}}$ - whose turn it.\n    If it is the policeman's turn, then the vertex is a winning vertex, if the coordinates of the policeman and the thief coincide, and the vertex is a losing one if it is not a winning one and the thief is on the exit vertex.\n    If it is the thief's turn, then a vertex is a losing vertex, if the coordinates of the two players coincide, and it is a winning vertex if it is not a losing one, and the thief is at the exit vertex.\n\n    The only point before implementing is not, that you need to decide if you want to build the graph **explicitly** or just construct it **on the fly**.\n    On one hand, building the graph explicitly will be a lot easier and there is less chance of making mistakes.\n    On the other hand, it will increase the amount of code and the running time will be slower than if you build the graph on the fly.\n\n    The following implementation will construct the graph explicitly:\n\n    ```cpp\n    struct State {\n        int P, T;\n        bool Pstep;\n    };\n\n    vector<State> adj_rev[100][100][2]; // [P][T][Pstep]\n    bool winning[100][100][2];\n    bool losing[100][100][2];\n    bool visited[100][100][2];\n    int degree[100][100][2];\n\n    void dfs(State v) {\n        visited[v.P][v.T][v.Pstep] = true;\n        for (State u : adj_rev[v.P][v.T][v.Pstep]) {\n            if (!visited[u.P][u.T][u.Pstep]) {\n                if (losing[v.P][v.T][v.Pstep])\n                    winning[u.P][u.T][u.Pstep] = true;\n                else if (--degree[u.P][u.T][u.Pstep] == 0)\n                    losing[u.P][u.T][u.Pstep] = true;\n                else\n                    continue;\n                dfs(u);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    int main() {\n        int n, m;\n        cin >> n >> m;\n        vector<string> a(n);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n            cin >> a[i];\n\n        for (int P = 0; P < n*m; P++) {\n            for (int T = 0; T < n*m; T++) {\n                for (int Pstep = 0; Pstep <= 1; Pstep++) {\n                    int Px = P/m, Py = P%m, Tx = T/m, Ty = T%m;\n                    if (a[Px][Py]=='*' || a[Tx][Ty]=='*')\n                        continue;\n                \n                    bool& win = winning[P][T][Pstep];\n                    bool& lose = losing[P][T][Pstep];\n                    if (Pstep) {\n                        win = Px==Tx && Py==Ty;\n                        lose = !win && a[Tx][Ty] == 'E';\n                    } else {\n                        lose = Px==Tx && Py==Ty;\n                        win = !lose && a[Tx][Ty] == 'E';\n                    }\n                    if (win || lose)\n                        continue;\n\n                    State st = {P,T,!Pstep};\n                    adj_rev[P][T][Pstep].push_back(st);\n                    st.Pstep = Pstep;\n                    degree[P][T][Pstep]++;\n                \n                    const int dx[] = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1, -1, 1, 1};\n                    const int dy[] = {0, 1, 0, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1};\n                    for (int d = 0; d < (Pstep ? 8 : 4); d++) {\n                        int PPx = Px, PPy = Py, TTx = Tx, TTy = Ty;\n                        if (Pstep) {\n                            PPx += dx[d];\n                            PPy += dy[d];\n                        } else {\n                            TTx += dx[d];\n                            TTy += dy[d];\n                        }\n\n                        if (PPx >= 0 && PPx < n && PPy >= 0 && PPy < m && a[PPx][PPy] != '*' &&\n                            TTx >= 0 && TTx < n && TTy >= 0 && TTy < m && a[TTx][TTy] != '*')\n                        {\n                            adj_rev[PPx*m+PPy][TTx*m+TTy][!Pstep].push_back(st);\n                            ++degree[P][T][Pstep];\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        for (int P = 0; P < n*m; P++) {\n            for (int T = 0; T < n*m; T++) {\n                for (int Pstep = 0; Pstep <= 1; Pstep++) {\n                    if ((winning[P][T][Pstep] || losing[P][T][Pstep]) && !visited[P][T][Pstep])\n                        dfs({P, T, (bool)Pstep});\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int P_st, T_st;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {\n                if (a[i][j] == 'P')\n                    P_st = i*m+j;\n                else if (a[i][j] == 'T')\n                    T_st = i*m+j;\n            }\n        }\n\n        if (winning[P_st][T_st][true]) {\n            cout << \"Police catches the thief\"  << endl;\n        } else if (losing[P_st][T_st][true]) {\n            cout << \"The thief escapes\" << endl;\n        } else {\n            cout << \"Draw\" << endl;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

It should return the starting index, ending index, and the word itself.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: The output of the function is `(0, 6, 'clearly')`, while the expected output is `(0, 7, 'clearly')`. This indicates that the ending index is off by one.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Logic**:\n   - The starting index is calculated correctly using `sentence.index(word)`.\n   - The ending index is calculated as `start_index + len(clean_word) - 1`. However, `len(clean_word)` gives the length of the cleaned word, which is correct, but the way we are calculating the ending index is not considering the original word's length correctly when punctuation is involved.\n\n4. **Where I Went Wrong**: \n   - The ending index should be calculated based on the original word's length, not the cleaned word's length. The cleaned word is stripped of punctuation, which causes the length to be shorter than the original word.\n   - Therefore, I need to adjust the calculation of the ending index to use the length of the original word instead.\n\n5. **Next Steps**: \n   - I will modify the code to calculate the ending index based on the original word's length instead of the cleaned word's length.\n\nNow, I will implement these changes in the code.\n\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Strip punctuation from the word\n        clean_word = ''.join(char for char in word if char.isalnum() or char == 'y')\n        \n        # Check if the cleaned word ends with \"ly\"\n        if clean_word.endswith(\"ly\"):\n            # Calculate the starting index of the word in the sentence\n            start_index = sentence.index(word)\n            # Calculate the ending index of the original word in the sentence\n            end_index = start_index + len(word) - 1\n            # Return the indices and the cleaned word\n            return (start_index, end_index, clean_word)\n    \n    # If no adverb is found, return None (not specified in the problem)\n    return None\n```"

$s[j] = s[k]$: if this is the case, then adding the symbol $s[j]$ to $s_2$ doesn't violate its pre-simplicity.\n      So we simply increment the pointers $j$ and $k$.\n    - $s[j] > s[k]$: here, the string $s_2 + s[j]$ becomes simple.\n      We can increment $j$ and reset $k$ back to the beginning of $s_2$, so that the next character can be compared with the beginning of the simple word.\n    - $s[j] < s[k]$: the string $s_2 + s[j]$ is no longer pre-simple.\n      Therefore we will split the pre-simple string $s_2$ into its simple strings and the remainder, possibly empty.\n      The simple string will have the length $j - k$.\n      In the next iteration we start again with the remaining $s_2$.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here we present the implementation of the Duval algorithm, which will return the desired Lyndon factorization of a given string $s$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=duval_algorithm}\n    vector<string> duval(string const& s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int i = 0;\n        vector<string> factorization;\n        while (i < n) {\n            int j = i + 1, k = i;\n            while (j < n && s[k] <= s[j]) {\n                if (s[k] < s[j])\n                    k = i;\n                else\n                    k++;\n                j++;\n            }\n            while (i <= k) {\n                factorization.push_back(s.substr(i, j - k));\n                i += j - k;\n            }\n        }\n        return factorization;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Complexity\n\n    Let us estimate the running time of this algorithm.\n\n    The **outer while loop** does not exceed $n$ iterations, since at the end of each iteration $i$ increases.\n    Also the second inner while loop runs in $O(n)$, since is only outputs the final factorization.\n\n    So we are only interested in the **first inner while loop**.\n    How many iterations does it perform in the worst case?\n    It's easy to see that the simple words that we identify in each iteration of the outer loop are longer than the remainder that we additionally compared.\n    Therefore also the sum of the remainders will be smaller than $n$, which means that we only perform at most $O(n)$ iterations of the first inner while loop.\n    In fact the total number of character comparisons will not exceed $4n - 3$.\n\n    ## Finding the smallest cyclic shift\n\n    Let there be a string $s$.\n    We construct the Lyndon factorization for the string $s + s$ (in $O(n)$ time).\n    We will look for a simple string in the factorization, which starts at a position less than $n$ (i.e. it starts in the first instance of $s$), and ends in a position greater than or equal to $n$ (i.e. in the second instance) of $s$).\n    It is stated, that the position of the start of this simple string will be the beginning of the desired smallest cyclic shift.\n    This can be easily verified using the definition of the Lyndon decomposition.\n\n    The beginning of the simple block can be found easily - just remember the pointer $i$ at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop, which indicated the beginning of the current pre-simple string.\n\n    So we get the following implementation:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=smallest_cyclic_string}\n    string min_cyclic_string(string s) {\n        s += s;\n        int n = s.size();\n        int i = 0, ans = 0;\n        while (i < n / 2) {\n            ans = i;\n            int j = i + 1, k = i;\n            while (j < n && s[k] <= s[j]) {\n                if (s[k] < s[j])\n                    k = i;\n                else\n                    k++;\n                j++;\n            }\n            while (i <= k)\n                i += j - k;\n        }\n        return s.substr(ans, n / 2);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Z-function and its calculation\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Z-function and its calculation\n\n    Suppose we are given a string $s$ of length $n$. The **Z-function** for this string is an array of length $n$ where the $i$-th element is equal to the greatest number of characters starting from the position $i$ that coincide with the first characters of $s$.\n\n    In other words, $z[i]$ is the length of the longest string that is, at the same time, a prefix of $s$ and a prefix of the suffix of $s$ starting at $i$.\n\n    **Note.** In this article, to avoid ambiguity, we assume $0$-based indexes; that is: the first character of $s$ has index $0$ and the last one has index $n-1$.\n\n    The first element of Z-function, $z[0]$, is generally not well defined. In this article we will assume it is zero (although it doesn't change anything in the algorithm implementation).\n\n    This article presents an algorithm for calculating the Z-function in $O(n)$ time, as well as various of its applications.\n\n    ## Examples\n\n    For example, here are the values of the Z-function computed for different strings:\n\n    * \"aaaaa\" - $[0, 4, 3, 2, 1]$\n    * \"aaabaab\" - $[0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]$\n    * \"abacaba\" - $[0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1]$\n\n    ## Trivial algorithm\n\n    Formal definition can be represented in the following elementary $O(n^2)$ implementation.\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> z_function_trivial(string s) {\n    \tint n = s.size();\n    \tvector<int> z(n);\n    \tfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n    \t\twhile (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {\n    \t\t\tz[i]++;\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    \treturn z;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We just iterate through every position $i$ and update $z[i]$ for each one of them, starting from $z[i] = 0$ and incrementing it as long as we don't find a mismatch (and as long as we don't reach the end of the line).\n\n    Of course, this is not an efficient implementation. We will now show the construction of an efficient implementation.\n\n    ## Efficient algorithm to compute the Z-function\n\n    To obtain an efficient algorithm we will compute the values of $z[i]$ in turn from $i = 1$ to $n - 1$ but at the same time, when computing a new value, we'll try to make the best use possible of the previously computed values.\n\n    For the sake of brevity, let's call **segment matches** those substrings that coincide with a prefix of $s$. For example, the value of the desired Z-function $z[i]$ is the length of the segment match starting at position $i$ (and that ends at position $i + z[i] - 1$).\n\n    To do this, we will keep **the $[l, r)$ indices of the rightmost segment match**. That is, among all detected segments we will keep the one that ends rightmost. In a way, the index $r$ can be seen as the \"boundary\" to which our string $s$ has been scanned by the algorithm; everything beyond that point is not yet known.\n\n    Then, if the current index (for which we have to compute the next value of the Z-function) is $i$, we have one of two options:\n\n    *   $i \\geq r$ -- the current position is **outside** of what we have already processed.\n\n        We will then compute $z[i]$ with the **trivial algorithm** (that is, just comparing values one by one). Note that in the end, if $z[i] > 0$, we'll have to update the indices of the rightmost segment, because it's guaranteed that the new $r = i + z[i]$ is better than the previous $r$.\n\n    *   $i < r$ -- the current position is inside the current segment match $[l, r)$.\n\n        Then we can use the already calculated Z-values to \"initialize\" the value of $z[i]$ to something (it sure is better than \"starting from zero\"), maybe even some big number.\n\n        For this, we observe that the substrings $s[l \\dots r)$ and $s[0 \\dots r-l)$ **match**. This means that as an initial approximation for $z[i]$ we can take the value already computed for the corresponding segment $s[0 \\dots r-l)$, and that is $z[i-l]$.\n\n        However, the value $z[i-l]$ could be too large: when applied to position $i$ it could exceed the index $r$. This is not allowed because we know nothing about the characters to the right of $r$: they may differ from those required.\n\n        Here is **an example** of a similar scenario:\n\n        $$ s = \"aaaabaa\" $$\n\n        When we get to the last position ($i = 6$), the current match segment will be $[5, 7)$. Position $6$ will then match position $6 - 5 = 1$, for which the value of the Z-function is $z[1] = 3$. Obviously, we cannot initialize $z[6]$ to $3$, it would be completely incorrect. The maximum value we could initialize it to is $1$ -- because it's the largest value that doesn't bring us beyond the index $r$ of the match segment $[l, r)$.\n\n        Thus, as an **initial approximation** for $z[i]$ we can safely take:\n\n        $$ z_0[i] = \\min(r - i,\\; z[i-l]) $$\n\n        After having $z[i]$ initialized to $z_0[i]$, we try to increment $z[i]$ by running the **trivial algorithm** -- because in general, after the border $r$, we cannot know if the segment will continue to match or not.\n\n    Thus, the whole algorithm is split in two cases, which differ only in **the initial value** of $z[i]$: in the first case it's assumed to be zero, in the second case it is determined by the previously computed values (using the above formula). After that, both branches of this algorithm can be reduced to the implementation of **the trivial algorithm**, which starts immediately after we specify the initial value.\n\n    The algorithm turns out to be very simple. Despite the fact that on each iteration the trivial algorithm is run, we have made significant progress, having an algorithm that runs in linear time. Later on we will prove that the running time is linear.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Implementation turns out to be rather concise:\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> z_function(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> z(n);\n        int l = 0, r = 0;\n        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if(i < r) {\n                z[i] = min(r -

$s[2 \\dots 5] = abab$\n    - $s[3 \\dots 6] = baba$\n    - $s[7 \\dots 7] = ee$\n\n    Another example:\n\n    $$abaaba$$\n\n    Here there are only two repetitions\n\n    - $s[0 \\dots 5] = abaaba$\n    - $s[2 \\dots 3] = aa$\n\n    ## Number of repetitions\n\n    In general there can be up to $O(n^2)$ repetitions in a string of length $n$.\n    An obvious example is a string consisting of $n$ times the same letter, in this case any substring of even length is a repetition.\n    In general any periodic string with a short period will contain a lot of repetitions.\n\n    On the other hand this fact does not prevent computing the number of repetitions in $O(n \\log n)$ time, because the algorithm can give the repetitions in compressed form, in groups of several pieces at once.\n\n    There is even the concept, that describes groups of periodic substrings with tuples of size four.\n    It has been proven that we the number of such groups is at most linear with respect to the string length.\n\n    Also, here are some more interesting results related to the number of repetitions:\n\n      - The number of primitive repetitions (those whose halves are not repetitions) is at most $O(n \\log n)$.\n      - If we encode repetitions with tuples of numbers (called Crochemore triples) $(i,~ p,~ r)$ (where $i$ is the position of the beginning, $p$ the length of the repeating substring, and $r$ the number of repetitions), then all repetitions can be described with $O(n \\log n)$ such triples.\n      - Fibonacci strings, defined as \n    \n        \\[\\begin{align}\n        t_0 &= a, \\\\\\\\\n        t_1 &= b, \\\\\\\\\n        t_i &= t_{i-1} + t_{i-2},\n        \\end{align}\\]\n    \n        are \"strongly\" periodic.\n        The number of repetitions in the Fibonacci string $f_i$, even in the compressed with Crochemore triples, is $O(f_n \\log f_n)$.\n        The number of primitive repetitions is also $O(f_n \\log f_n)$.\n\n    ## Main-Lorentz algorithm\n\n    The idea behind the Main-Lorentz algorithm is **divide-and-conquer**.\n\n    It splits the initial string into halves, and computes the number of repetitions that lie completely in each halve by two recursive calls.\n    Then comes the difficult part.\n    The algorithm finds all repetitions starting in the first half and ending in the second half (which we will call **crossing repetitions**).\n    This is the essential part of the Main-Lorentz algorithm, and we will discuss it in detail here.\n\n    The complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms is well researched.\n    The [master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)) says, that we will end up with an $O(n \\log n)$ algorithm, if we can compute the crossing repetitions in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    ### Search for crossing repetitions\n\n    So we want to find all such repetitions that start in the first half of the string, let's call it $u$, and end in the second half, let's call it $v$:\n\n    $$s = u + v$$\n\n    Their lengths are approximately equal to the length of $s$ divided by two.\n\n    Consider an arbitrary repetition and look at the middle character (more precisely the first character of the second half of the repetition).\n    I.e. if the repetition is a substring $s[i \\dots j]$, then the middle character is $(i + j + 1) / 2$.\n\n    We call a repetition **left** or **right** depending on which string this character is located - in the string $u$ or in the string $v$.\n    In other words a string is called left, if the majority of it lies in $u$, otherwise we call it right.\n\n    We will now discuss how to find **all left repetitions**.\n    Finding all right repetitions can be done in the same way.\n\n    Let us denote the length of the left repetition by $2l$ (i.e. each half of the repetition has length $l$).\n    Consider the first character of the repetition falling into the string $v$ (it is at position $|u|$ in the string $s$).\n    It coincides with the character $l$ positions before it, let's denote this position $cntr$.\n\n    We will fixate this position $cntr$, and **look for all repetitions at this position** $cntr$.\n\n    For example:\n\n    $$c ~ \\underset{cntr}{a} ~ c ~ | ~ a ~ d ~ a$$\n\n    The vertical lines divides the two halves.\n    Here we fixated the position $cntr = 1$, and at this position we find the repetition $caca$.\n\n    It is clear, that if we fixate the position $cntr$, we simultaneously fixate the length of the possible repetitions: $l = |u| - cntr$.\n    Once we know how to find these repetitions, we will iterate over all possible values for $cntr$ from $0$ to $|u|-1$, and find all left crossover repetitions of length $l = |u|,~ |u|-1,~ \\dots, 1$.\n\n    ### Criterion for left crossing repetitions\n\n    Now, how can we find all such repetitions for a fixated $cntr$?\n    Keep in mind that there still can be multiple such repetitions.\n\n    Let's again look at a visualization, this time for the repetition $abcabc$:\n\n    $$\\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ \\overbrace{\\underset{cntr}{b} ~ c}^{l_2} ~ \\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ | ~ \\overbrace{b ~ c}^{l_2}$$\n\n    Here we denoted the lengths of the two pieces of the repetition with $l_1$ and $l_2$:\n    $l_1$ is the length of the repetition up to the position $cntr-1$, and $l_2$ is the length of the repetition from $cntr$ to the end of the half of the repetition.\n    We have $2l = l_1 + l_2 + l_1 + l_2$ as the total length of the repetition.\n\n    Let us generate **necessary and sufficient** conditions for such a repetition at position $cntr$ of length $2l = 2(l_1 + l_2) = 2(|u| - cntr)$:\n\n    - Let $k_1$ be the largest number such that the first $k_1$ characters before the position $cntr$ coincide with the last $k_1$ characters in the string $u$:\n  \n    $$\n    u[cntr - k_1 \\dots cntr - 1] = u[|u| - k_1 \\dots |u| - 1]\n    $$\n  \n    - Let $k_2$ be the largest number such that the $k_2$ characters starting at position $cntr$ coincide with the first $k_2$ characters in the string $v$:\n\n    $$  \n      u[cntr \\dots cntr + k_2 - 1] = v[0 \\dots k_2 - 1]\n    $$\n  \n    - Then we have a repetition exactly for any pair $(l_1,~ l_2)$ with\n\n    $$\n      \\begin{align}\n      l_1 &\\le k_1, \\\\\\\\\n      l_2 &\\le k_2. \\\\\\\\\n      \\end{align}\n    $$\n\n    To summarize:\n\n    - We fixate a specific position $cntr$.\n    - All repetition which we will find now have length $2l = 2(|u| - cntr)$.\n      There might be multiple such repetitions, they depend on the lengths $l_1$ and $l_2 = l - l_1$.\n    - We find $k_1$ and $k_2$ as described above.\n    - Then all suitable repetitions are the ones for which the lengths of the pieces $l_1$ and $l_2$ satisfy the conditions:\n\n    $$\n      \\begin{align}\n      l_1 + l_2 &= l = |u| - cntr \\\\\\\\\n      l_1 &\\le k_1, \\\\\\\\\n      l_2 &\\le k_2. \\\\\\\\\n      \\end{align}\n    $$\n\n    Therefore the only remaining part is how we can compute the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ quickly for every position $cntr$.\n    Luckily we can compute them in $O(1)$ using the [Z-function](../string/z-function.md):\n\n    - To can find the value $k_1$ for each position by calculating the Z-function for the string $\\overline{u}$ (i.e. the reversed string $u$).\n      Then the value $k_1$ for a particular $cntr$ will be equal to the corresponding value of the array of the Z-function.\n    - To precompute all values $k_2$, we calculate the Z-function for the string $v + \\# + u$ (i.e. the string $u$ concatenated with the separator character $\\#$ and the string $v$).\n      Again we just need to look up the corresponding value in the Z-function to get the $k_2$ value.\n\n    So this is enough to find all left crossing repetitions.\n\n    ### Right crossing repetitions\n\n    For computing the right crossing repetitions we act similarly:\n    we define the center $cntr$ as the character corresponding to the last character in the string $u$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

$s[j] = s[k]$: if this is the case, then adding the symbol $s[j]$ to $s_2$ doesn't violate its pre-simplicity.\n      So we simply increment the pointers $j$ and $k$.\n    - $s[j] > s[k]$: here, the string $s_2 + s[j]$ becomes simple.\n      We can increment $j$ and reset $k$ back to the beginning of $s_2$, so that the next character can be compared with the beginning of the simple word.\n    - $s[j] < s[k]$: the string $s_2 + s[j]$ is no longer pre-simple.\n      Therefore we will split the pre-simple string $s_2$ into its simple strings and the remainder, possibly empty.\n      The simple string will have the length $j - k$.\n      In the next iteration we start again with the remaining $s_2$.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here we present the implementation of the Duval algorithm, which will return the desired Lyndon factorization of a given string $s$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=duval_algorithm}\n    vector<string> duval(string const& s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int i = 0;\n        vector<string> factorization;\n        while (i < n) {\n            int j = i + 1, k = i;\n            while (j < n && s[k] <= s[j]) {\n                if (s[k] < s[j])\n                    k = i;\n                else\n                    k++;\n                j++;\n            }\n            while (i <= k) {\n                factorization.push_back(s.substr(i, j - k));\n                i += j - k;\n            }\n        }\n        return factorization;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Complexity\n\n    Let us estimate the running time of this algorithm.\n\n    The **outer while loop** does not exceed $n$ iterations, since at the end of each iteration $i$ increases.\n    Also the second inner while loop runs in $O(n)$, since is only outputs the final factorization.\n\n    So we are only interested in the **first inner while loop**.\n    How many iterations does it perform in the worst case?\n    It's easy to see that the simple words that we identify in each iteration of the outer loop are longer than the remainder that we additionally compared.\n    Therefore also the sum of the remainders will be smaller than $n$, which means that we only perform at most $O(n)$ iterations of the first inner while loop.\n    In fact the total number of character comparisons will not exceed $4n - 3$.\n\n    ## Finding the smallest cyclic shift\n\n    Let there be a string $s$.\n    We construct the Lyndon factorization for the string $s + s$ (in $O(n)$ time).\n    We will look for a simple string in the factorization, which starts at a position less than $n$ (i.e. it starts in the first instance of $s$), and ends in a position greater than or equal to $n$ (i.e. in the second instance) of $s$).\n    It is stated, that the position of the start of this simple string will be the beginning of the desired smallest cyclic shift.\n    This can be easily verified using the definition of the Lyndon decomposition.\n\n    The beginning of the simple block can be found easily - just remember the pointer $i$ at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop, which indicated the beginning of the current pre-simple string.\n\n    So we get the following implementation:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=smallest_cyclic_string}\n    string min_cyclic_string(string s) {\n        s += s;\n        int n = s.size();\n        int i = 0, ans = 0;\n        while (i < n / 2) {\n            ans = i;\n            int j = i + 1, k = i;\n            while (j < n && s[k] <= s[j]) {\n                if (s[k] < s[j])\n                    k = i;\n                else\n                    k++;\n                j++;\n            }\n            while (i <= k)\n                i += j - k;\n        }\n        return s.substr(ans, n / 2);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Z-function and its calculation\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Z-function and its calculation\n\n    Suppose we are given a string $s$ of length $n$. The **Z-function** for this string is an array of length $n$ where the $i$-th element is equal to the greatest number of characters starting from the position $i$ that coincide with the first characters of $s$.\n\n    In other words, $z[i]$ is the length of the longest string that is, at the same time, a prefix of $s$ and a prefix of the suffix of $s$ starting at $i$.\n\n    **Note.** In this article, to avoid ambiguity, we assume $0$-based indexes; that is: the first character of $s$ has index $0$ and the last one has index $n-1$.\n\n    The first element of Z-function, $z[0]$, is generally not well defined. In this article we will assume it is zero (although it doesn't change anything in the algorithm implementation).\n\n    This article presents an algorithm for calculating the Z-function in $O(n)$ time, as well as various of its applications.\n\n    ## Examples\n\n    For example, here are the values of the Z-function computed for different strings:\n\n    * \"aaaaa\" - $[0, 4, 3, 2, 1]$\n    * \"aaabaab\" - $[0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]$\n    * \"abacaba\" - $[0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1]$\n\n    ## Trivial algorithm\n\n    Formal definition can be represented in the following elementary $O(n^2)$ implementation.\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> z_function_trivial(string s) {\n    \tint n = s.size();\n    \tvector<int> z(n);\n    \tfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n    \t\twhile (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {\n    \t\t\tz[i]++;\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    \treturn z;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We just iterate through every position $i$ and update $z[i]$ for each one of them, starting from $z[i] = 0$ and incrementing it as long as we don't find a mismatch (and as long as we don't reach the end of the line).\n\n    Of course, this is not an efficient implementation. We will now show the construction of an efficient implementation.\n\n    ## Efficient algorithm to compute the Z-function\n\n    To obtain an efficient algorithm we will compute the values of $z[i]$ in turn from $i = 1$ to $n - 1$ but at the same time, when computing a new value, we'll try to make the best use possible of the previously computed values.\n\n    For the sake of brevity, let's call **segment matches** those substrings that coincide with a prefix of $s$. For example, the value of the desired Z-function $z[i]$ is the length of the segment match starting at position $i$ (and that ends at position $i + z[i] - 1$).\n\n    To do this, we will keep **the $[l, r)$ indices of the rightmost segment match**. That is, among all detected segments we will keep the one that ends rightmost. In a way, the index $r$ can be seen as the \"boundary\" to which our string $s$ has been scanned by the algorithm; everything beyond that point is not yet known.\n\n    Then, if the current index (for which we have to compute the next value of the Z-function) is $i$, we have one of two options:\n\n    *   $i \\geq r$ -- the current position is **outside** of what we have already processed.\n\n        We will then compute $z[i]$ with the **trivial algorithm** (that is, just comparing values one by one). Note that in the end, if $z[i] > 0$, we'll have to update the indices of the rightmost segment, because it's guaranteed that the new $r = i + z[i]$ is better than the previous $r$.\n\n    *   $i < r$ -- the current position is inside the current segment match $[l, r)$.\n\n        Then we can use the already calculated Z-values to \"initialize\" the value of $z[i]$ to something (it sure is better than \"starting from zero\"), maybe even some big number.\n\n        For this, we observe that the substrings $s[l \\dots r)$ and $s[0 \\dots r-l)$ **match**. This means that as an initial approximation for $z[i]$ we can take the value already computed for the corresponding segment $s[0 \\dots r-l)$, and that is $z[i-l]$.\n\n        However, the value $z[i-l]$ could be too large: when applied to position $i$ it could exceed the index $r$. This is not allowed because we know nothing about the characters to the right of $r$: they may differ from those required.\n\n        Here is **an example** of a similar scenario:\n\n        $$ s = \"aaaabaa\" $$\n\n        When we get to the last position ($i = 6$), the current match segment will be $[5, 7)$. Position $6$ will then match position $6 - 5 = 1$, for which the value of the Z-function is $z[1] = 3$. Obviously, we cannot initialize $z[6]$ to $3$, it would be completely incorrect. The maximum value we could initialize it to is $1$ -- because it's the largest value that doesn't bring us beyond the index $r$ of the match segment $[l, r)$.\n\n        Thus, as an **initial approximation** for $z[i]$ we can safely take:\n\n        $$ z_0[i] = \\min(r - i,\\; z[i-l]) $$\n\n        After having $z[i]$ initialized to $z_0[i]$, we try to increment $z[i]$ by running the **trivial algorithm** -- because in general, after the border $r$, we cannot know if the segment will continue to match or not.\n\n    Thus, the whole algorithm is split in two cases, which differ only in **the initial value** of $z[i]$: in the first case it's assumed to be zero, in the second case it is determined by the previously computed values (using the above formula). After that, both branches of this algorithm can be reduced to the implementation of **the trivial algorithm**, which starts immediately after we specify the initial value.\n\n    The algorithm turns out to be very simple. Despite the fact that on each iteration the trivial algorithm is run, we have made significant progress, having an algorithm that runs in linear time. Later on we will prove that the running time is linear.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Implementation turns out to be rather concise:\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> z_function(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> z(n);\n        int l = 0, r = 0;\n        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if(i < r) {\n                z[i] = min(r - i, z[i - l]);\n            }\n            while(i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {\n                z[i]++;\n            }\n            if(i + z[i] > r) {\n                l = i;\n                r = i + z[i];\n            }\n        }\n        return z;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Finding repetitions\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Finding repetitions\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n\n    A **repetition** is two occurrences of a string in a row.\n    In other words a repetition can be described by a pair of indices $i < j$ such that the substring $s[i \\dots j]$ consists of two identical strings written after each other.\n\n    The challenge is to **find all repetitions** in a given string $s$.\n    Or a simplified task: find **any** repetition or find the **longest** repetition.\n\n    The algorithm described here was published in 1982 by Main and Lorentz.\n\n    ## Example\n\n    Consider the repetitions in the following example string:\n\n    $$acababaee$$\n\n    The string contains the following three repetitions:\n\n    - $s[2 \\dots 5] = abab$\n    - $s[3 \\dots 6] = baba$\n    - $s[7 \\dots 7] = ee$\n\n    Another example:\n\n    $$abaaba$$\n\n    Here there are only two repetitions\n\n    - $s[0 \\dots 5] = abaaba$\n    - $s[2 \\dots 3] = aa$\n\n    ## Number of repetitions\n\n    In general there can be up to $O(n^2)$ repetitions in a string of length $n$.\n    An obvious example is a string consisting of $n$ times the same letter, in this case any substring of even length is a repetition.\n    In general any periodic string with a short period will contain a lot of repetitions.\n\n    On the other hand this fact does not prevent computing the number of repetitions in $O(n \\log n)$ time, because the algorithm can give the repetitions in compressed form, in groups of several pieces at once.\n\n    There is even the concept, that describes groups of periodic substrings with tuples of size four.\n    It has been proven that we the number of such groups is at most linear with respect to the string length.\n\n    Also, here are some more interesting results related to the number of repetitions:\n\n      - The number of primitive repetitions (those whose halves are not repetitions) is at most $O(n \\log n)$.\n      - If we encode repetitions with tuples of numbers (called Crochemore triples) $(i,~ p,~ r)$ (where $i$ is the position of the beginning, $p$ the length of the repeating substring, and $r$ the number of repetitions), then all repetitions can be described with $O(n \\log n)$ such triples.\n      - Fibonacci strings, defined as \n    \n        \\[\\begin{align}\n        t_0 &= a, \\\\\\\\\n        t_1 &= b, \\\\\\\\\n        t_i &= t_{i-1} + t_{i-2},\n        \\end{align}\\]\n    \n        are \"strongly\" periodic.\n        The number of repetitions in the Fibonacci string $f_i$, even in the compressed with Crochemore triples, is $O(f_n \\log f_n)$.\n        The number of primitive repetitions is also $O(f_n \\log f_n)$.\n\n    ## Main-Lorentz algorithm\n\n    The idea behind the Main-Lorentz algorithm is **divide-and-conquer**.\n\n    It splits the initial string into halves, and computes the number of repetitions that lie completely in each halve by two recursive calls.\n    Then comes the difficult part.\n    The algorithm finds all repetitions starting in the first half and ending in the second half (which we will call **crossing repetitions**).\n    This is the essential part of the Main-Lorentz algorithm, and we will discuss it in detail here.\n\n    The complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms is well researched.\n    The [master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)) says, that we will end up with an $O(n \\log n)$ algorithm, if we can compute the crossing repetitions in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    ### Search for crossing repetitions\n\n    So we want to find all such repetitions that start in the first half of the string, let's call it $u$, and end in the second half, let's call it $v$:\n\n    $$s = u + v$$\n\n    Their lengths are approximately equal to the length of $s$ divided by two.\n\n    Consider an arbitrary repetition and look at the middle character (more precisely the first character of the second half of the repetition).\n    I.e. if the repetition is a substring $s[i \\dots j]$, then the middle character is $(i + j + 1) / 2$.\n\n    We call a repetition **left** or **right** depending on which string this character is located - in the string $u$ or in the string $v$.\n    In other words a string is called left, if the majority of it lies in $u$, otherwise we call it right.\n\n    We will now discuss how to find **all left repetitions**.\n    Finding all right repetitions can be done in the same way.\n\n    Let us denote the length of the left repetition by $2l$ (i.e. each half of the repetition has length $l$).\n    Consider the first character of the repetition falling into the string $v$ (it is at position $|u|$ in the string $s$).\n    It coincides with the character $l$ positions before it, let's denote this position $cntr$.\n\n    We will fixate this position $cntr$, and **look for all repetitions at this position** $cntr$.\n\n    For example:\n\n    $$c ~ \\underset{cntr}{a} ~ c ~ | ~ a ~ d ~ a$$\n\n    The vertical lines divides the two halves.\n    Here we fixated the position $cntr = 1$, and at this position we find the repetition $caca$.\n\n    It is clear, that if we fixate the position $cntr$, we simultaneously fixate the length of the possible repetitions: $l = |u| - cntr$.\n    Once we know how to find these repetitions, we will iterate over all possible values for $cntr$ from $0$ to $|u|-1$, and find all left crossover repetitions of length $l = |u|,~ |u|-1,~ \\dots, 1$.\n\n    ### Criterion for left crossing repetitions\n\n    Now, how can we find all such repetitions for a fixated $cntr$?\n    Keep in mind that there still can be multiple such repetitions.\n\n    Let's again look at a visualization, this time for the repetition $abcabc$:\n\n    $$\\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ \\overbrace{\\underset{cntr}{b} ~ c}^{l_2} ~ \\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ | ~ \\overbrace{b ~ c}^{l_2}$$\n\n    Here we denoted the lengths of the two pieces of the repetition with $l_1$ and $l_2$:\n    $l_1$ is the length of the repetition up to the position $cntr-1$, and $l_2$ is the length of the repetition from $cntr$ to the end of the half of the repetition.\n    We have $2l = l_1 + l_2 + l_1 + l_2$ as the total length of the repetition.\n\n    Let us generate **necessary and sufficient** conditions for such a repetition at position $cntr$ of length $2l = 2(l_1 + l_2) = 2(|u| - cntr)$:\n\n    - Let $k_1$ be the largest number such that the first $k_1$ characters before the position $cntr$ coincide with the last $k_1$ characters in the string $u$:\n  \n    $$\n    u[cntr - k_1 \\dots cntr - 1] = u[|u| - k_1 \\dots |u| - 1]\n    $$\n  \n    - Let $k_2$ be the largest number such that the $k_2$ characters starting at position $cntr$ coincide with the first $k_2$ characters in the string $v$:\n\n    $$  \n      u[cntr \\dots cntr + k_2 - 1] = v[0 \\dots k_2 - 1]\n    $$\n  \n    - Then we have a repetition exactly for any pair $(l_1,~ l_2)$ with\n\n    $$\n      \\begin{align}\n      l_1 &\\le k_1, \\\\\\\\\n      l_2 &\\le k_2. \\\\\\\\\n      \\end{align}\n    $$\n\n    To summarize:\n\n    - We fixate a specific position $cntr$.\n    - All repetition which we will find now have length $2l = 2(|u| - cntr)$.\n      There might be multiple such repetitions, they depend on the lengths $l_1$ and $l_2 = l - l_1$.\n    - We find $k_1$ and $k_2$ as described above.\n    - Then all suitable repetitions are the ones for which the lengths of the pieces $l_1$ and $l_2$ satisfy the conditions:\n\n    $$\n      \\begin{align}\n      l_1 + l_2 &= l = |u| - cntr \\\\\\\\\n      l_1 &\\le k_1, \\\\\\\\\n      l_2 &\\le k_2. \\\\\\\\\n      \\end{align}\n    $$\n\n    Therefore the only remaining part is how we can compute the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ quickly for every position $cntr$.\n    Luckily we can compute them in $O(1)$ using the [Z-function](../string/z-function.md):\n\n    - To can find the value $k_1$ for each position by calculating the Z-function for the string $\\overline{u}$ (i.e. the reversed string $u$).\n      Then the value $k_1$ for a particular $cntr$ will be equal to the corresponding value of the array of the Z-function.\n    - To precompute all values $k_2$, we calculate the Z-function for the string $v + \\# + u$ (i.e. the string $u$ concatenated with the separator character $\\#$ and the string $v$).\n      Again we just need to look up the corresponding value in the Z-function to get the $k_2$ value.\n\n    So this is enough to find all left crossing repetitions.\n\n    ### Right crossing repetitions\n\n    For computing the right crossing repetitions we act similarly:\n    we define the center $cntr$ as the character corresponding to the last character in the string $u$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
