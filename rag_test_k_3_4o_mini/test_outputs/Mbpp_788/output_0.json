    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of strings and a single string as input, and returns a new tuple that combines all these strings together.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to take the list of strings and the single string, and combine them into a single tuple. The order of the elements in the tuple should be the same as they appear in the input list followed by the single string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `new_tuple` that takes two parameters: a list of strings and a single string.\n   - Create a new tuple that consists of all elements from the list followed by the single string.\n   - Return the newly created tuple.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef new_tuple(strings, single_string):\n    # Create a new tuple by combining the list of strings and the single string\n    result = tuple(strings) + (single_string,)\n    # Return the newly created tuple\n    return result\n```",
