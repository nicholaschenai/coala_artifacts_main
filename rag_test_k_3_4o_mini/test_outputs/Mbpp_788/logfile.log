INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/788 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of strings and a single string as input, and returns a new tuple that combines all the elements of the list with the single string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will take the list of strings and the single string, and combine them into a tuple. A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after it is created. We will use the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list into a tuple and then add the single string to it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function new_tuple(input_list, input_string):
       Convert input_list to a tuple
       Create a new tuple that includes all elements of the converted tuple and input_string
       Return the new tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def new_tuple(input_list, input_string):
    # Convert the input list to a tuple
    tuple_from_list = tuple(input_list)
    # Create a new tuple that includes all elements of the converted tuple and the input string
    result_tuple = tuple_from_list + (input_string,)
    # Return the new tuple
    return result_tuple

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    Title: Z-function and its calculation
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    ### Comments on this implementation

    The whole solution is given as a function which returns an array of length $n$ -- the Z-function of $s$.

    Array $z$ is initially filled with zeros. The current rightmost match segment is assumed to be $[0; 0)$ (that is, a deliberately small segment which doesn't contain any $i$).

    Inside the loop for $i = 1 \dots n - 1$ we first determine the initial value $z[i]$ -- it will either remain zero or be computed using the above formula.

    Thereafter, the trivial algorithm attempts to increase the value of $z[i]$ as much as possible.

    In the end, if it's required (that is, if $i + z[i] > r$), we update the rightmost match segment $[l, r)$.

    ## Asymptotic behavior of the algorithm

    We will prove that the above algorithm has a running time that is linear in the length of the string -- thus, it's $O(n)$.

    The proof is very simple.

    We are interested in the nested `while` loop, since everything else is just a bunch of constant operations which sums up to $O(n)$.

    We will show that **each iteration** of the `while` loop will increase the right border $r$ of the match segment.

    To do that, we will consider both branches of the algorithm:

    *   $i \geq r$

        In this case, either the `while` loop won't make any iteration (if $s[0] \ne s[i]$), or it will take a few iterations, starting at position $i$, each time moving one character to the right. After that, the right border $r$ will necessarily be updated.

        So we have found that, when $i \geq r$, each iteration of the `while` loop increases the value of the new $r$ index.

    *   $i < r$

        In this case, we initialize $z[i]$ to a certain value $z_0$ given by the above formula. Let's compare this initial value $z_0$ to the value $r - i$. We will have three cases:

          *   $z_0 < r - i$

              We prove that in this case no iteration of the `while` loop will take place.

              It's easy to prove, for example, by contradiction: if the `while` loop made at least one iteration, it would mean that initial approximation $z[i] = z_0$ was inaccurate (less than the match's actual length). But since $s[l \dots r)$ and $s[0 \dots r-l)$ are the same, this would imply that $z[i-l]$ holds the wrong value (less than it should be).

              Thus, since $z[i-l]$ is correct and it is less than $r - i$, it follows that this value coincides with the required value $z[i]$.

          *   $z_0 = r - i$

              In this case, the `while` loop can make a few iterations, but each of them will lead to an increase in the value of the $r$ index because we will start comparing from $s[r]$, which will climb beyond the $[l, r)$ interval.

          *   $z_0 > r - i$

              This option is impossible, by definition of $z_0$.

    So, we have proved that each iteration of the inner loop make the $r$ pointer advance to the right. Since $r$ can't be more than $n-1$, this means that the inner loop won't make more than $n-1$ iterations.

    As the rest of the algorithm obviously works in $O(n)$, we have proved that the whole algorithm for computing Z-functions runs in linear time.

    ## Applications

    We will now consider some uses of Z-functions for specific tasks.

    These applications will be largely similar to applications of [prefix function](prefix-function.md).

    ### Search the substring

    To avoid confusion, we call $t$ the **string of text**, and $p$ the **pattern**. The problem is: find all occurrences of the pattern $p$ inside the text $t$.

    To solve this problem, we create a new string $s = p + \diamond + t$, that is, we apply string concatenation to $p$ and $t$ but we also put a separator character $\diamond$ in the middle (we'll choose $\diamond$ so that it will certainly not be present anywhere in the strings $p$ or $t$).

    Compute the Z-function for $s$. Then, for any $i$ in the interval $[0; \; \operatorname{length}(t) - 1]$, we will consider the corresponding value $k = z[i + \operatorname{length}(p) + 1]$. If $k$ is equal to $\operatorname{length}(p)$ then we know there is one occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$, otherwise there is no occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$.

    The running time (and memory consumption) is $O(\operatorname{length}(t) + \operatorname{length}(p))$.

    ### Number of distinct substrings in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$, count the number of distinct substrings of $s$.

    We'll solve this problem iteratively. That is: knowing the current number of different substrings, recalculate this amount after adding to the end of $s$ one character.

    So, let $k$ be the current number of distinct substrings of $s$. We append a new character $c$ to $s$. Obviously, there can be some new substrings ending in this new character $c$ (namely, all those strings that end with this symbol and that we haven't encountered yet).

    Take a string $t = s + c$ and invert it (write its characters in reverse order). Our task is now to count how many prefixes of $t$ are not found anywhere else in $t$. Let's compute the Z-function of $t$ and find its maximum value $z_{max}$. Obviously, $t$'s prefix of length $z_{max}$ occurs also somewhere in the middle of $t$. Clearly, shorter prefixes also occur.

    So, we have found that the number of new substrings that appear when symbol $c$ is appended to $s$ is equal to $\operatorname{length}(t) - z_{max}$.

    Consequently, the running time of this solution is $O(n^2)$ for a string of length $n$.

    It's worth noting that in exactly the same way we can recalculate, still in $O(n)$ time, the number of distinct substrings when appending a character in the beginning of the string, as well as when removing it (from the end or the beginning).

    ### String compression

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$. Find its shortest "compressed" representation, that is: find a string $t$ of shortest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    A solution is: compute the Z-function of $s$, loop through all $i$ such that $i$ divides $n$. Stop at the first $i$ such that $i + z[i] = n$. Then, the string $s$ can be compressed to the length $i$.

    The proof for this fact is the same as the solution which uses the [prefix function](prefix-function.md).

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 1/5
    # The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

    The inclusion-exclusion principle is an important combinatorial way to compute the size of a set or the probability of complex events. It relates the sizes of individual sets with their union.

    ## Statement

    ### The verbal formula

    The inclusion-exclusion principle can be expressed as follows:

    To compute the size of a union of multiple sets, it is necessary to sum the sizes of these sets **separately**, and then subtract the sizes of all **pairwise** intersections of the sets, then add back the size of the intersections of **triples** of the sets, subtract the size of **quadruples** of the sets, and so on, up to the intersection of **all** sets.

    ### The formulation in terms of sets

    The above definition can be expressed mathematically as follows:

    $$\left| \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{i=1}^n|A_i| - \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} |A_i \cap A_j| + \sum _{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}|A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} | A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n |$$

    And in a more compact way:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\Biggl |}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr |}$$

    ### The formulation using Venn diagrams

    Let the diagram show three sets $A$, $B$ and $C$:

    ![Venn diagram](venn-inclusion-exclusion.png "Venn diagram")

    Then the area of their union $A \cup B \cup C$ is equal to the sum of the areas $A$, $B$ and $C$ less double-covered areas $A \cap B$, $A \cap C$, $B \cap C$, but with the addition of the area covered by three sets $A \cap B \cap C$:

    $$S(A \cup B \cup C) = S(A) + S(B) + S(C) - S(A \cap B) - S(A \cap C) - S(B \cap C) + S(A \cap B \cap C)$$

    It can also be generalized for an association of $n$ sets.

    ### The formulation in terms of probability theory

    If $A_i$ $(i = 1,2...n)$ are events and ${\cal P}(A_i)$ the probability of an event from $A_i$ to occur, then the probability of their union (i.e. the probability that at least one of the events occur) is equal to:

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    {\cal P} \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right) &=& \sum_{i=1}^n{\cal P}(A_i)\ - \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} {\cal P}(A_i \cap A_j)\  + \\
    &+& \sum _{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}{\cal P}(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k) - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} {\cal P}( A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n )
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    And in a more compact way:

    $${\cal P} \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right) = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\ {\cal P}{\Biggl (}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr )}$$

    ## Proof

    For the proof it is convenient to use the mathematical formulation in terms of set theory:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\Biggl |}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr |}$$

    We want to prove that any element contained in at least one of the sets $A_i$ will occur in the formula only once (note that elements which are not present in any of the sets $A_i$ will never be considered on the right part of the formula).

    Consider an element $x$ occurring in $k \geq 1$ sets $A_i$. We will show it is counted only once in the formula. Note that:

    * in terms which $|J| = 1$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\ k$** times;
    * in terms which $|J| = 2$, the item $x$ will be counted **$-\ \binom{k}{2}$** times - because it will be counted in those terms that include two of the $k$ sets containing $x$;
    * in terms which $|J| = 3$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\ \binom{k}{3}$** times;
    * $\cdots$
    * in terms which $|J| = k$, the item $x$ will be counted **$(-1)^{k-1}\cdot \binom{k}{k}$** times;
    * in terms which $|J| \gt k$, the item $x$ will be counted **zero** times;

    This leads us to the following sum of [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ T = \binom{k}{1} - \binom{k}{2} + \binom{k}{3} - \cdots + (-1)^{i-1}\cdot \binom{k}{i} + \cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\cdot \binom{k}{k}$$

    This expression is very similar to the binomial expansion of $(1 - x)^k$:

    $$ (1 - x)^k = \binom{k}{0} - \binom{k}{1} \cdot x + \binom{k}{2} \cdot x^2 - \binom{k}{3} \cdot x^3 + \cdots + (-1)^k\cdot \binom{k}{k} \cdot x^k $$

    When $x = 1$, $(1 - x)^k$ looks a lot like $T$. However, the expression has an additional $\binom{k}{0} = 1$, and it is multiplied by $-1$. That leads us to $(1 - 1)^k = 1 - T$. Therefore $T = 1 - (1 - 1)^k = 1$, what was required to prove. The element is counted only once.

    ## Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly $r$ sets {data-toc-label="Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly r sets"}

    Inclusion-exclusion principle can be rewritten to calculate number of elements which are present in zero sets:

    $$\left|\bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A_i}\right|=\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \sum_{|X|=m} \left|\bigcap_{i\in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    Consider its generalization to calculate number of elements which are present in exactly $r$ sets:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{|B|=r}\left[\bigcap_{i \in B} A_i \cap \bigcap_{j \not\in B} \overline{A_j}\right]\right|=\sum_{m=r}^n (-1)^{m-r}\dbinom{m}{r} \sum_{|X|=m} \left|\bigcap_{i \in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    To prove this formula, consider some particular $B$. Due to basic inclusion-exclusion principle we can say about it that:

    $$\left|\bigcap_{i \in B} A_i \cap \bigcap_{j \not \in B} \overline{A_j}\right|=\sum_{m=r}^{n} (-1)^{m-r} \sum_{\substack{|X|=m \newline B \subset X}}\left|\bigcap_{i\in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    The sets on the left side do not intersect for different $B$, thus we can sum them up directly. Also one should note that any set $X$ will always have coefficient $(-1)^{m-r}$ if it occurs and it will occur for exactly $\dbinom{m}{r}$ sets $B$. 

    ## Usage when solving problems

    The inclusion-exclusion principle is hard to understand without studying its applications.

    First, we will look at three simplest tasks "at paper", illustrating applications of the principle, and then consider more practical problems which are difficult to solve without inclusion-exclusion principle.

    Tasks asking to "find the **number** of ways" are worth of note, as they sometimes lead to polynomial solutions, not necessarily exponential.

    ### A simple task on permutations

    Task: count how many permutations of numbers from $0$ to $9$ exist such that the first element is greater than $1$ and the last one is less than $8$.

    Let's count the number of "bad" permutations, that is, permutations in which the first element is $\leq 1$ and/or the last is $\geq 8$.

    We will denote by $X$ the set of permutations in which the first element is $\leq 1$ and $Y$ the set of permutations in which the last element is $\geq 8$. Then the number of "bad" permutations, as on the inclusion-exclusion formula, will be:

    $$ |X \cup Y| = |X| + |Y| - |X \cap Y| $$

    After a simple combinatorial calculation, we will get to:

    $$ 2 \cdot 9! + 2 \cdot 9! - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 8! $$

    The only thing left is to subtract this number from the total of $10!$ to get the number of "good" permutations.

    ### A simple task on (0, 1, 2) sequences

    Task: count how many sequences of length $n$ exist consisting only of numbers $0,1,2$ such that each number occurs **at least once**.

    Again let us turn to the inverse problem, i.e. we calculate the number of sequences which do **not** contain **at least one** of the numbers.

    Let's denote by $A_i (i = 0,1,2)$ the set of sequences in which the digit $i$ does **not** occur.
    The formula of inclusion-exclusion on the number of "bad" sequences will be:

    $$ |A_0 \cup A_1 \cup A_2| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_0 \cap A_1| - |A_0 \cap A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_2| + |A_0 \cap A_1 \cap A_2| $$

    * The size of each $A_i$ is $2^n$, as each sequence can only contain two of the digits.
    * The size of each pairwise intersection $A_i \cap A_j$  is equal to $1$, as there will be only one digit to build the sequence.
    * The size of the intersection of all three sets is equal to $0$, as there will be no digits to build the sequence.

    As we solved the inverse problem, we subtract it from the total of $3^n$ sequences:

    $$3^n - (3 \cdot 2^n - 3 \cdot 1 + 0)$$

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/788 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of strings and a single string as input, and returns a new tuple that combines all these strings together.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to take the list of strings and the single string, and combine them into a single tuple. The order of the elements in the tuple should be the same as they appear in the input list followed by the single string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `new_tuple` that takes two parameters: a list of strings and a single string.
   - Create a new tuple that consists of all elements from the list followed by the single string.
   - Return the newly created tuple.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def new_tuple(strings, single_string):
    # Create a new tuple by combining the list of strings and the single string
    result = tuple(strings) + (single_string,)
    # Return the newly created tuple
    return result
```
