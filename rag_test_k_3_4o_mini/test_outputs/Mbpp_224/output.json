    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a Python function that counts how many bits are set to 1 (also known as \"set bits\") in the binary representation of a given integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To count the number of set bits in a number, we can use a method that repeatedly checks the least significant bit (rightmost bit) of the number. If this bit is 1, we increment our count. Then, we can remove this bit from the number by performing a bitwise AND operation with the number minus one. We repeat this process until the number becomes zero.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_Set_Bits(n):\n       initialize count to 0\n       while n is not 0:\n           n = n & (n - 1)  // This operation removes the rightmost set bit\n           increment count by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of set bits\n    count = 0\n    # Loop until n becomes 0\n    while n != 0:\n        # Remove the rightmost set bit from n\n        n = n & (n - 1)\n        # Increment the count of set bits\n        count += 1\n    # Return the total count of set bits\n    return count\n```",
