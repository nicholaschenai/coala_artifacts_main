Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n \t\n    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.\n\n    Examples:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 01010000\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n | (n-1) = 01011111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    --------------------\n    ~n        = 10100111\n    ```\n\n    ### Shift operators\n\n    There are two operators for shifting bits.\n\n    -   $\\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.\n        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\gg 2 = 101_2 \\gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\\frac{5}{2^2} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1$.\n        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.\n\n    -   $\\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.\n        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\ll 3 = 101_2 \\ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \\cdot 2^3 = 5 \\cdot 8 = 40$.\n\n        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.\n\n\n    ## Useful tricks\n\n    ### Set/flip/clear a bit\n\n    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.\n    $1 \\ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\\sim(1 \\ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.\n\n    - $n ~|~ (1 \\ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\wedge~ (1 \\ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\&~ \\sim(1 \\ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n\n    ### Check if a bit is set\n\n    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {\n        return (number >> x) & 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2\n\n    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).\n    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.\n    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {\n        return n && !(n & (n - 1));\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Clear the most-right set bit\n\n    The expression $n ~\\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.\n    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.\n    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.\n\n    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 00110100\n    n-1       = 00110011\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 00110000\n    ```\n\n    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm\n\n    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.\n\n    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    int countSetBits(int n)\n    {\n        int count = 0;\n        while (n)\n        {\n            n = n & (n - 1);\n            count++;\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Bit manipulation\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n\n    ### Additional tricks\n\n    - $n ~\\&~ (n + 1)$ clears all trailing ones: $0011~0111_2 \\rightarrow 0011~0000_2$.\n    - $n ~|~ (n + 1)$ sets the last cleared bit: $0011~0101_2 \\rightarrow 0011~0111_2$.\n    - $n ~\\&~ -n$ extracts the last set bit: $0011~0100_2 \\rightarrow 0000~0100_2$.\n\n    Many more can be found in the book [Hacker's Delight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker%27s_Delight).\n\n    ### Language and compiler support\n\n    C++ supports some of those operations since C++20 via the [bit](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/bit) standard library:\n\n    - `has_single_bit`: checks if the number is a power of two\n    - `bit_ceil` / `bit_floor`: round up/down to the next power of two\n    - `rotl` / `rotr`: rotate the bits in the number\n    - `countl_zero` / `countr_zero` / `countl_one` / `countr_one`: count the leading/trailing zeros/ones\n    - `popcount`: count the number of set bits\n\n    Additionally, there are also predefined functions in some compilers that help working with bits.\n    E.g. GCC defines a list at [Built-in Functions Provided by GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html) that also work in older versions of C++:\n\n    - `__builtin_popcount(unsigned int)` returns the number of set bits (`__builtin_popcount(0b0001'0010'1100) == 4`)\n    - `__builtin_ffs(int)` finds the index of the first (most right) set bit (`__builtin_ffs(0b0001'0010'1100) == 3`)\n    - `__builtin_clz(unsigned int)` the count of leading zeros (`__builtin_clz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 23`)\n    - `__builtin_ctz(unsigned int)` the count of trailing zeros (`__builtin_ctz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 2`)\n\n    _Note that some of the operations (both the C++20 functions and the Compiler Built-in ones) might be quite slow in GCC if you don't enable a specific compiler target with `#pragma GCC target(\"popcnt\")`._\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Bit manipulation\n    Section: Representing sets\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Representing sets}\n\n    Every subset of a set\n    $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,n-1\\}$\n    can be represented as an $n$ bit integer\n    whose one bits indicate which\n    elements belong to the subset.\n    This is an efficient way to represent sets,\n    because every element requires only one bit of memory,\n    and set operations can be implemented as bit operations.\n\n    For example, since \\texttt{int} is a 32-bit type,\n    an \\texttt{int} number can represent any subset\n    of the set $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,31\\}$.\n    The bit representation of the set $\\{1,3,4,8\\}$ is\n    \\[00000000000000000000000100011010,\\]\n    which corresponds to the number $2^8+2^4+2^3+2^1=282$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Set implementation}\n\n    The following code declares an \\texttt{int}\n    variable $x$ that can contain\n    a subset of $\\{0,1,2,\\ldots,31\\}$.\n    After this, the code adds the elements 1, 3, 4 and 8\n    to the set and prints the size of the set.\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int x = 0;\n    x |= (1<<1);\n    x |= (1<<3);\n    x |= (1<<4);\n    x |= (1<<8);\n    cout << __builtin_popcount(x) << \"\\n\"; // 4\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    Then, the following code prints all\n    elements that belong to the set:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {\n        if (x&(1<<i)) cout << i << \" \";\n    }\n    // output: 1 3 4 8\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Set operations}\n\n    Set operations can be implemented as follows as bit operations:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{lll}\n    & set syntax & bit syntax \\\\\n    \\hline\n    intersection & $a \\cap b$ & $a$ \\& $b$ \\\\\n    union & $a \\cup b$ & $a$ | $b$ \\\\\n    complement & $\\bar a$ & \\textasciitilde$a$ \\\\\n    difference & $a \\setminus b$ & $a$ \\& (\\textasciitilde$b$) \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    For example, the following code first constructs\n    the sets $x=\\{1,3,4,8\\}$ and $y=\\{3,6,8,9\\}$,\n    and then constructs the set $z = x \\cup y = \\{1,3,4,6,8,9\\}$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int x = (1<<1)|(1<<3)|(1<<4)|(1<<8);\n    int y = (1<<3)|(1<<6)|(1<<8)|(1<<9);\n    int z = x|y;\n    cout << __builtin_popcount(z) << \"\\n\"; // 6\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Iterating through subsets}\n\n    The following code goes through\n    the subsets of $\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\}$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int b = 0; b < (1<<n); b++) {\n        // process subset b\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    The following code goes through\n    the subsets with exactly $k$ elements:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int b = 0; b < (1<<n); b++) {\n        if (__builtin_popcount(b) == k) {\n            // process subset b\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    The following code goes through the subsets\n    of a set $x$:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int b = 0;\n    do {\n        // process subset b\n    } while (b=(b-x)&x);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
