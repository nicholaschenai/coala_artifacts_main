INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/641 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the nth nonagonal number. A nonagonal number is a figurate number that represents a nonagon (a nine-sided polygon). The formula to find the nth nonagonal number is given by the formula: \( P(n) = \frac{n(7n - 5)}{2} \).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the nth nonagonal number, we will use the formula mentioned above. We will take the input n, apply the formula, and return the result. The function will be straightforward since it only involves basic arithmetic operations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION is_nonagonal(n):
       IF n is less than 1:
           RETURN an error or invalid value
       nonagonal_number = (n * (7 * n - 5)) / 2

    Title: Josephus Problem
    Part: 1/1
    # Josephus Problem

    ## Statement

    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.
    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. 
    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.
    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.
    The process stops when one number remains.
    It is required to find the last number.

    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).

    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.
    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \log n)$.
    We want something better though.

    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution

    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.

    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:

    $$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
    n\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\
    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\
    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\
    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\
    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\
    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\
    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\
    \end{array}$$

    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:

    $$J_{n,k} = \left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \bmod n \right) + 1$$

    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$

    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:

    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \bmod n$$

    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.

    ## Implementation

    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;
    }
    ```

    **Non-recursive form** :

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
      	  res = (res + k) % i;
        return res + 1;
    }
    ```

    This formula can also be found analytically.
    Again here we assume 0-indexing.
    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.
    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \bmod n$.
    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \ \bmod n$.

    ## Modeling a $O(k \log n)$ solution

    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.
    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$) in one run without looping over.
    Afterwards we have $n - \lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k)$-th number.
    So we have to shift by that many.
    We can notice that $\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k$ is simply $-n \bmod k$.
    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.
    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.

    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.

    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;
        if (k == 1)
            return n-1;
        if (k > n)
            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;
        int cnt = n / k;
        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);
        res -= n % k;
        if (res < 0)
            res += n;
        else
            res += res / (k - 1);
        return res;
    }
    ```

    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:

    $$ n \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) ^ x = 1, $$

    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:

    $$\ln n + x \ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) = 0,$$ 
    $$x = - \frac{\ln n}{\ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)},$$

    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:

    $$x \approx k \ln n$$

    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \log n)$.

    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$

    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.

    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):

    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$

    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:

    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$

    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, "restarting" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:

    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \left(n-2^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor} \right)$$

    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$

    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler "The Josephus Problem" and Odlyzko, Wilf "Functional iteration and the Josephus problem").

    Title: Catalan Numbers
    Part: 1/1
    # Catalan Numbers
    Catalan numbers is a number sequence, which is found useful in a number of combinatorial problems, often involving recursively-defined objects.

    This sequence was named after the Belgian mathematician [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan), who lived in the 19th century. (In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).

    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):

     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \ldots$

    ### Application in some combinatorial problems

    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for

    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.
    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.
    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.
    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).
    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.
    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).
    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).
    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).
    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.
    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).


    ## Calculations

    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.

    ### Recursive formula
 
    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$

    $$C_n = \sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \geq 2$$

    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.

    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.

    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :

    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.

    #### C++ implementation 

    ```cpp
    const int MOD = ....
    const int MAX = ....
    int catalan[MAX];
    void init() {
        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;
        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {
            catalan[i] = 0;
            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {
                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;
                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {
                    catalan[i] -= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Analytical formula

    $$C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1} {\binom{2n}{n}}$$

    (here $\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).

    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \times n$ is given by $\binom{2n}{n}$.

    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \times n$.

    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$ are $\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as "bad" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above "bad" paths, obtaining the formula:

    $$C_n = \binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n + 1} \binom{2n}{n} , {n} \geq 0$$

    \section{Catalan numbers}

    \index{Catalan number}

    The \key{Catalan number}
    %\footnote{E. C. Catalan (1814--1894) was a Belgian mathematician.}
    $C_n$ equals the
    number of valid
    parenthesis expressions that consist of
    $n$ left parentheses and $n$ right parentheses.

    For example, $C_3=5$, because
    we can construct the following parenthesis
    expressions using three
    left and right parentheses:

    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \texttt{()()()}
    \item \texttt{(())()}
    \item \texttt{()(())}
    \item \texttt{((()))}
    \item \texttt{(()())}
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Parenthesis expressions}

    \index{parenthesis expression}

    What is exactly a \emph{valid parenthesis expression}?
    The following rules precisely define all
    valid parenthesis expressions:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item An empty parenthesis expression is valid.
    \item If an expression $A$ is valid,
    then also the expression
    \texttt{(}$A$\texttt{)} is valid.
    \item If expressions $A$ and $B$ are valid,
    then also the expression $AB$ is valid.
    \end{itemize}

    Another way to characterize valid 
    parenthesis expressions is that if
    we choose any prefix of such an expression,
    it has to contain at least as many left
    parentheses as right parentheses.
    In addition, the complete expression has to
    contain an equal number of left and right
    parentheses.

    \subsubsection{Formula 1}

    Catalan numbers can be calculated using the formula
    \[ C_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_{i} C_{n-i-1}.\]

    The sum goes through the ways to divide the
    expression into two parts
    such that both parts are valid
    expressions and the first part is as short as possible
    but not empty.
    For any $i$, the first part contains $i+1$ pairs
    of parentheses and the number of expressions
    is the product of the following values:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item $C_{i}$: the number of ways to construct an expression
    using the parentheses of the first part,
    not counting the outermost parentheses
    \item $C_{n-i-1}$: the number of ways to construct an
    expression using the parentheses of the second part
    \end{itemize}

    The base case is $C_0=1$,
    because we can construct an empty parenthesis
    expression using zero pairs of parentheses.

    \subsubsection{Formula 2}

    Catalan numbers can also be calculated
    using binomial coefficients:
    \[ C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} {2n \choose n}\]
    The formula can be explained as follows:

    There are a total of ${2n \choose n}$ ways
    to construct a (not necessarily valid)
    parenthesis expression that contains $n$ left
    parentheses and $n$ right parentheses.
    Let us calculate the number of such
    expressions that are \emph{not} valid.

    If a parenthesis expression is not valid,
    it has to contain a prefix where the
    number of right parentheses exceeds the
    number of left parentheses.
    The idea is to reverse each parenthesis
    that belongs to such a prefix.
    For example, the expression
    \texttt{())()(} contains a prefix \texttt{())},
    and after reversing the prefix,
    the expression becomes \texttt{)((()(}.

    The resulting expression consists of $n+1$
    left parentheses and $n-1$ right parentheses.
    The number of such expressions is ${2n \choose n+1}$,
    which equals the number of non-valid
    parenthesis expressions.
    Thus, the number of valid parenthesis
    expressions can be calculated using the formula
    \[{2n \choose n}-{2n \choose n+1} = {2n \choose n} - \frac{n}{n+1} {2n \choose n} = \frac{1}{n+1} {2n \choose n}.\]

    \subsubsection{Counting trees}

    Catalan numbers are also related to trees:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item there are $C_n$ binary trees of $n$ nodes
    \item there are $C_{n-1}$ rooted trees of $n$ nodes
    \end{itemize}
    \noindent
    For example, for $C_3=5$, the binary trees are

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \path[draw,thick,-] (0,0) -- (-1,-1);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (0,0) -- (1,-1);
    \draw[fill=white] (0,0) circle (0.3);
    \draw[fill=white] (-1,-1) circle (0.3);

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/641 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that calculates the nth nonagonal number. A nonagonal number is a figurate number that represents a nonagon (a nine-sided polygon). The formula for the nth nonagonal number is given by the formula: \( P(n) = \frac{n(7n - 5)}{2} \).

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To find the nth nonagonal number, we can directly use the formula mentioned above. We will take the input \( n \), apply the formula, and return the result. This approach is efficient as it computes the result in constant time \( O(1) \).

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function is_nonagonal(n):
       return (n * (7 * n - 5)) // 2
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def nonagonal_number(n):
    # Calculate the nth nonagonal number using the formula
    return (n * (7 * n - 5)) // 2

def is_nonagonal(n: int) -> int:
    # Call the helper function to get the nth nonagonal number
    return nonagonal_number(n)
