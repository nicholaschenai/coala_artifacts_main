    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that finds all perfect squares between two given numbers, inclusive. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   - We need to identify the range of integers whose squares fall between the two given numbers.\n   - To do this, we can find the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to the lower bound and the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the upper bound.\n   - We can then generate a list of squares of all integers in this range.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function perfect_squares(lower, upper):\n       initialize an empty list for results\n       find the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of lower\n       find the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of upper\n       for each integer in the range from smallest to largest:\n           calculate the square of the integer\n           add the square to the results list\n       return the results list\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef perfect_squares(lower: int, upper: int) -> list:\n    results = []\n    # Find the smallest integer whose square is >= lower\n    start = math.ceil(math.sqrt(lower))\n    # Find the largest integer whose square is <= upper\n    end = math.floor(math.sqrt(upper))\n    \n    # Generate perfect squares in the range\n    for i in range(start, end + 1):\n        results.append(i * i)\n    \n    return results\n```",
