It is required to find a subarray $a[l \\ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:\n\n    $$ \\max_{ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.\n    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\n    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.\n\n    ## Algorithm 1\n\n    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm is very simple.\n\n    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.\n\n    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \\ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.\n\n    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.\n\n    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.\n\n    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ \u2014 we will only need the current element from it.\n\n    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.\n\n    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        int cur = sum - min_sum;\n        if (cur > ans) {\n            ans = cur;\n            ans_l = min_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < min_sum) {\n            min_sum = sum;\n            min_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Algorithm 2\n\n    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.\n\n    **Proof:**\n\n    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum \u2014 so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.\n\n    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.\n\n    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a \"critical\" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \\ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.\n\n    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum);\n        sum = max(sum, 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        if (sum > ans) {\n            ans = sum;\n            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < 0) {\n            sum = 0;\n            minus_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Longest increasing subsequence\n    Part: 1/3\n    # Longest increasing subsequence\n\n    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \\dots n-1]$.\n    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.\n\n    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \\dots i_k$ such that\n\n    $$i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_k,\\quad\n    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \\dots < a[i_k]$$\n\n    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.\n    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.\n\n    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label=\"Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming\"}\n\n    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.\n    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.\n\n    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.\n\n    ### Finding the length\n\n    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \\dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.\n\n    !!! example\n\n        $$\\begin{array}{ll}\n        a &= \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\} \\\\\n        d &= \\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\\}\n        \\end{array}$$\n\n        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\\}$ or $\\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\\{0, 1\\}$ having length 2.\n\n    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.\n    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.\n\n    So let the current index be $i$.\n    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \\dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.\n    Then there are two options:\n\n    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.\n\n    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.\n        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.\n\n        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.\n        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.\n  \n        $$d[i] = \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(1, \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)\\right)$$\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0;

Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes\n    called \\index{Kadane's algorithm} \\key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means\n    that just one loop is enough.\n    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,\n    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.\n    After this, the answer for the problem is the\n    maximum of those sums.\n\n    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray\n    that ends at position $k$.\n    There are two possibilities:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.\n    \\item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends\n    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    In the latter case, since we want to\n    find a subarray with maximum sum,\n    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$\n    should also have the maximum sum.\n    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently\n    by calculating the maximum subarray sum\n    for each ending position from left to right.\n\n    The following code implements the algorithm:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int best = 0, sum = 0;\n    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);\n        best = max(best,sum);\n    }\n    cout << best << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The algorithm only contains one loop\n    that goes through the input,\n    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.\n    This is also the best possible time complexity,\n    because any algorithm for the problem\n    has to examine all array elements at least once.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    It is interesting to study how efficient \n    algorithms are in practice.\n    The following table shows the running times\n    of the above algorithms for different\n    values of $n$ on a modern computer.\n\n    In each test, the input was generated randomly.\n    The time needed for reading the input was not\n    measured.\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n    array size $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $10^2$ & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^3$ & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^4$ & > $10.0$ s & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^5$ & > $10.0$ s & $5.3$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^6$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^7$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    The comparison shows that all algorithms\n    are efficient when the input size is small,\n    but larger inputs bring out remarkable\n    differences in the running times of the algorithms.\n    Algorithm 1 becomes slow\n    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2\n    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.\n    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process\n    even the largest inputs instantly.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
