Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.\n    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,\n    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the\n    computers utilizing it.\n\n    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:\n\n    ```nohighlight\n        0    0\n        1    1\n        2    1Z\n        3    10\n        4    11\n        5    1ZZ\n        6    1Z0\n        7    1Z1\n        8    10Z\n        9    100\n    ```\n\n    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.\n\n    ```nohighlight\n        -1   Z\n        -2   Z1\n        -3   Z0\n        -4   ZZ\n        -5   Z11\n    ```\n\n    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.\n\n    ## Conversion algorithm\n\n    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is\n    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,\n    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -\n    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.\n\n    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n\n    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$\n\n    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:\n\n    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.\n\n    The final result is `1Z101`.\n\n    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n\n    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \\cdot 1 + 27 \\cdot (-1) + 9 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$\n\n    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n\n    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$\n\n    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:\n\n    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.\n    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.\n    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.\n\n    The final result is `100Z10`.\n\n    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n\n    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \\cdot 1 + 81 \\cdot 0 + 27 \\cdot 0 + 9 \\cdot (-1) + 3 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Continued fractions\n    Part: 4/12\n    ```\n\n    !!! example \"[GCJ 2019, Round 2 - New Elements: Part 2](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/round/0000000000051679/0000000000146184)\"\n        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$.
