INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/558 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two integers as input and calculates the sum of the absolute differences of their corresponding digits. If the integers have different lengths, we should consider the missing digits as zeros.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - Convert both integers to strings to easily access each digit.
   - Pad the shorter string with leading zeros so that both strings have the same length.
   - Iterate through the digits of both strings, calculate the absolute difference for each pair of corresponding digits, and accumulate the sum of these differences.
   - Return the final sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function digit_distance_nums(num1, num2):
       convert num1 and num2 to strings
       find the maximum length of both strings
       pad the shorter string with leading zeros
       initialize a sum variable to 0
       for each digit in both strings:
           calculate the absolute difference
           add the difference to the sum
       return the sum
   ```

    # Balanced Ternary

    !["Setun computer using Balanced Ternary system"](https://earltcampbell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/setun.jpeg?w=300)

    This is a non-standard but still positional **numeral system**. Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.
    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,
    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the
    computers utilizing it.

    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:

    ```nohighlight
        0    0
        1    1
        2    1Z
        3    10
        4    11
        5    1ZZ
        6    1Z0
        7    1Z1
        8    10Z
        9    100
    ```

    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.

    ```nohighlight
        -1   Z
        -2   Z1
        -3   Z0
        -4   ZZ
        -5   Z11
    ```

    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.

    ## Conversion algorithm

    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is
    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,
    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -
    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.

    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.

    The final result is `1Z101`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \cdot 1 + 27 \cdot (-1) + 9 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$

    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.

    The final result is `100Z10`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \cdot 1 + 81 \cdot 0 + 27 \cdot 0 + 9 \cdot (-1) + 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        === "Python"

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/558 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the sum of the absolute differences of each corresponding digit between two integers. For example, if the two integers are 1 and 2, the difference between their digits is 1, so the result should be 1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - Convert both integers to strings to easily access each digit.
   - Pad the shorter string with leading zeros so both strings have the same length.
   - Iterate through the digits of both strings, calculate the absolute difference for each pair of corresponding digits, and accumulate the sum of these differences.
   - Return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function digit_distance_nums(num1, num2):
       convert num1 and num2 to strings
       pad the shorter string with leading zeros
       initialize sum_difference to 0
       for each digit in both strings:
           calculate the absolute difference
           add the difference to sum_difference
       return sum_difference
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def digit_distance_nums(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
    # Convert both numbers to strings
    str_num1 = str(num1)
    str_num2 = str(num2)
