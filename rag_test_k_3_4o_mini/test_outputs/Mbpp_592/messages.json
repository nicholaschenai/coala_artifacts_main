\\index{combinatorics}\n\n    \\key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting\n    combinations of objects.\n    Usually, the goal is to find a way to\n    count the combinations efficiently\n    without generating each combination separately.\n\n    As an example, consider the problem\n    of counting the number of ways to\n    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.\n    For example, there are 8 representations\n    for $4$:\n    \\begin{multicols}{2}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $1+1+1+1$\n    \\item $1+1+2$\n    \\item $1+2+1$\n    \\item $2+1+1$\n    \\item $2+2$\n    \\item $3+1$\n    \\item $1+3$\n    \\item $4$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{multicols}\n\n    A combinatorial problem can often be solved\n    using a recursive function.\n    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$\n    that gives the number of representations for $n$.\n    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.\n    The values of the function\n    can be recursively calculated as follows:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n                   1               & n = 0\\\\\n                   f(0)+f(1)+\\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case is $f(0)=1$,\n    because the empty sum represents the number 0.\n    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to\n    choose the first number of the sum.\n    If the first number is $k$,\n    there are $f(n-k)$ representations\n    for the remaining part of the sum.\n    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values\n    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.\n\n    The first values for the function are:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    f(0) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    f(3) & = & 4 \\\\\n    f(4) & = & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced\n    with a closed-form formula.\n    In this problem,\n    \\[\n    f(n)=2^{n-1},\n    \\]\n    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$\n    possible positions for +-signs in the sum\n    and we can choose any subset of them.\n\n    \\section{Binomial coefficients}\n\n    \\index{binomial coefficient}\n\n    The \\key{binomial coefficient} ${n \\choose k}$\n    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset\n    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, ${5 \\choose 3}=10$,\n    because the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:\n    \\[ \\{1,2,3\\}, \\{1,2,4\\}, \\{1,2,5\\}, \\{1,3,4\\}, \\{1,3,5\\}, \n    \\{1,4,5\\}, \\{2,3,4\\}, \\{2,3,5\\}, \\{2,4,5\\}, \\{3,4,5\\} \\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 1}\n\n    Binomial coefficients can be\n    recursively calculated as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k}\n    \\]\n\n    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.\n    If $x$ is included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k-1$\n    elements from $n-1$ elements,\n    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.\n\n    The base cases for the recursion are\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}  =  {n \\choose n} = 1,\n    \\]\n    because there is always exactly\n    one way to construct an empty subset\n    and a subset that contains all the elements.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 2}\n\n    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\n    \\]\n\n    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.\n    We go through all permutations and always\n    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation\n    in the subset.\n    Since the order of the elements in the subset\n    and outside the subset does not matter,\n    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$\n\n    \\subsubsection{Properties}\n\n    For binomial coefficients,\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n \\choose n-k},\n    \\]\n    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into\n    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements\n    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.\n\n    The sum of binomial coefficients is\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}+{n \\choose 1}+{n \\choose 2}+\\ldots+{n \\choose n}=2^n.\n    \\]\n\n    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''\n    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to\n    the $n$th power:\n\n    \\[ (a+b)^n =\n    {n \\choose 0} a^n b^0 + \n    {n \\choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +\n    \\ldots + \n    {n \\choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +\n    {n \\choose n} a^0 b^n. \\]\n\n

Binomial Coefficients\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Binomial Coefficients\n\n    Binomial coefficients $\\binom n k$ are the number of ways to select a set of $k$ elements from $n$ different elements without taking into account the order of arrangement of these elements (i.e., the number of unordered sets).\n\n    Binomial coefficients are also the coefficients in the expansion of $(a + b) ^ n$ (so-called binomial theorem):\n\n    $$ (a+b)^n = \\binom n 0 a^n + \\binom n 1 a^{n-1} b + \\binom n 2 a^{n-2} b^2 + \\cdots + \\binom n k a^{n-k} b^k + \\cdots + \\binom n n b^n $$\n\n    It is believed that this formula, as well as the triangle which allows efficient calculation of the coefficients, was discovered by Blaise Pascal in the 17th century. Nevertheless, it was known to the Chinese mathematician Yang Hui, who lived in the 13th century. Perhaps it was discovered by a Persian scholar Omar Khayyam. Moreover, Indian mathematician Pingala, who lived  earlier in the 3rd. BC, got similar results. The merit of the Newton is that he generalized this formula for exponents that are not natural.\n\n    ## Calculation\n\n    **Analytic formula** for the calculation:\n\n    $$ \\binom n k = \\frac {n!} {k!(n-k)!} $$\n\n    This formula can be easily deduced from the problem of ordered arrangement (number of ways to select $k$ different elements from $n$ different elements). First, let's count the number of ordered selections of $k$ elements. There are $n$ ways to select the first element, $n-1$ ways to select the second element, $n-2$ ways to select the third element, and so on. As a result, we get the formula of the number of ordered arrangements: $n (n-1) (n-2) \\cdots (n - k + 1) = \\frac {n!} {(n-k)!}$. We can easily move to unordered arrangements, noting that each unordered arrangement corresponds to exactly $k!$ ordered arrangements ($k!$ is the number of possible permutations of $k$ elements). We get the final formula by dividing $\\frac {n!} {(n-k)!}$ by $k!$.\n\n    **Recurrence formula** (which is associated with the famous \"Pascal's Triangle\"):\n\n    $$ \\binom n k = \\binom {n-1} {k-1} + \\binom {n-1} k $$\n\n    It is easy to deduce this using the analytic formula.\n\n    Note that for $n \\lt k$ the value of $\\binom n k$ is assumed to be zero.\n\n    ## Properties\n\n    Binomial coefficients have many different properties. Here are the simplest of them:\n\n    *   Symmetry rule:\n\n        \\[ \\binom n k = \\binom n {n-k} \\]\n\n    *   Factoring in:\n\n        \\[ \\binom n k = \\frac n k \\binom {n-1} {k-1} \\]\n\n    *   Sum over $k$:\n\n        \\[ \\sum_{k = 0}^n \\binom n k = 2 ^ n \\]\n\n    *   Sum over $n$:\n\n        \\[ \\sum_{m = 0}^n \\binom m k = \\binom {n + 1} {k + 1} \\]\n\n    *   Sum over $n$ and $k$:\n\n        \\[ \\sum_{k = 0}^m  \\binom {n + k} k = \\binom {n + m + 1} m \\]\n\n    *   Sum of the squares:\n\n        \\[ {\\binom n 0}^2 + {\\binom n 1}^2 + \\cdots + {\\binom n n}^2 = \\binom {2n} n \\]\n\n    *   Weighted sum:\n\n        \\[ 1 \\binom n 1 + 2 \\binom n 2 + \\cdots + n \\binom n n = n 2^{n-1} \\]\n\n    *   Connection with the [Fibonacci numbers](../algebra/fibonacci-numbers.md):\n\n        \\[ \\binom n 0 + \\binom {n-1} 1 + \\cdots + \\binom {n-k} k + \\cdots + \\binom 0 n = F_{n+1} \\]\n\n    ## Calculation\n\n    ### Straightforward calculation using analytical formula\n\n    The first, straightforward formula is very easy to code, but this method is likely to overflow even for relatively small values of $n$ and $k$ (even if the answer completely fit into some datatype, the calculation of the intermediate factorials can lead to overflow). Therefore, this method often can only be used with [long arithmetic](../algebra/big-integer.md):\n\n    ```cpp\n    int C(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 1;\n        for (int i = n - k + 1; i <= n; ++i)\n            res *= i;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= k; ++i)\n            res /= i;\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Improved implementation\n\n    Note that in the above implementation numerator and denominator have the same number of factors ($k$), each of which is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, we can replace our fraction with a product $k$ fractions, each of which is real-valued. However, on each step after multiplying current answer by each of the next fractions the answer will still be integer (this follows from the property of factoring in). \n\n    C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int C(int n, int k) {\n        double res = 1;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i)\n            res = res * (n - k + i) / i;\n        return (int)(res + 0.01);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Here we carefully cast the floating point number to an integer, taking into account that due to the accumulated errors, it may be slightly less than the true value (for example, $2.99999$ instead of $3$).\n\n    ### Pascal's Triangle\n\n    By using the recurrence relation we can construct a table of binomial coefficients (Pascal's triangle) and take the result from it. The advantage of this method is that intermediate results never exceed the answer and calculating each new table element requires only one addition. The flaw is slow execution for large $n$ and $k$ if you just need a single value and not the whole table (because in order to calculate $\\binom n k$ you will need to build a table of all $\\binom i j, 1 \\le i \\le n, 1 \\le j \\le n$, or at least to $1 \\le j \\le \\min (i, 2k)$). The time complexity can be considered to be $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.\n\n    C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    const int maxn = ...;\n    int C[maxn + 1][maxn + 1];\n    C[0][0] = 1;\n    for (int n = 1; n <= maxn; ++n) {\n        C[n][0] = C[n][n] = 1;\n        for (int k = 1; k < n; ++k)\n            C[n][k] = C[n - 1][k - 1] + C[n - 1][k];\n    }\n    ```\n\n    If the entire table of values is not necessary, storing only two last rows of it is sufficient (current $n$-th row and the previous $n-1$-th).\n\n    ### Calculation in $O(1)$ {data-toc-label=\"Calculation in O(1)\"}\n\n    Finally, in some situations it is beneficial to precompute all the factorials in order to produce any necessary binomial coefficient with only two divisions later. This can be advantageous when using [long arithmetic](../algebra/big-integer.md), when the memory does not allow precomputation of the whole Pascal's triangle.\n\n\n    ## Computing binomial coefficients modulo $m$ {data-toc-label=\"Computing binomial coefficients modulo m\"}\n\n    Quite often you come across the problem of computing binomial coefficients modulo some $m$.\n\n    ### Binomial coefficient for small $n$ {data-toc-label=\"Binomial coefficient for small n\"}\n\n    The previously discussed approach of Pascal's triangle can be used to calculate all values of $\\binom{n}{k} \\bmod m$ for reasonably small $n$, since it requires time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. This approach can handle any modulo, since only addition operations are used.\n\n\n    ### Binomial coefficient modulo large prime\n\n    The formula for the binomial coefficients is\n\n    $$\\binom n k = \\frac {n!} {k!(n-k)!},$$\n\n    so if we want to compute it modulo some prime $m > n$ we get\n\n    $$\\binom n k \\equiv n! \\cdot (k!)^{-1} \\cdot ((n-k)!)^{-1} \\mod m.$$\n\n    First we precompute all factorials modulo $m$ up to $\\text{MAXN}!$ in $O(\\text{MAXN})$ time.\n\n    ```cpp\n    factorial[0] = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {\n        factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % m;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    And afterwards we can compute the binomial coefficient in $O(\\log m)$ time.\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long binomial_coefficient(int n, int k) {\n        return factorial[n] * inverse(factorial[k] * factorial[n - k] % m) % m;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We even can compute the binomial coefficient in $O(1)$ time if we precompute the inverses of all factorials in $O(\\text{MAXN} \\log m)$ using the regular method for computing the inverse, or even in $O(\\text{MAXN})$ time using the congruence $(x!)^{-1} \\equiv ((x-1)!)^{-1} \\cdot x^{-1}$ and the method for [computing all inverses](../algebra/module-inverse.md#mod-inv-all-num) in $O(n)$.\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long binomial_coefficient(int n, int k) {\n        return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % m * inverse_factorial[n - k] % m;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Combinatorics\n    Section: Binomial coefficients\n    Part: 2/2\n    $,\n    there are 6 solutions:\n\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]\n    \\newcommand\\lax[3]{\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --\n                        (#1+0.5,#2-0.5) -- (#1+0.5,#2+0.5);\n    \\ifthenelse{\\equal{#3}{1}}{\\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}\n    \\ifthenelse{\\equal{#3}{2}}{\\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}\n    \\ifthenelse{\\equal{#3}{2}}{\\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}\n    }\n    \\newcommand\\laa[7]{\n        \\lax{#1}{#2}{#3}\n        \\lax{#1+1.2}{#2}{#4}\n        \\lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}\n        \\lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}\n        \\lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}\n    }\n\n    \\laa{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}\n    \\laa{0}{-2}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}\n    \\laa{8}{0}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}\n    \\laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}\n    \\laa{16}{0}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}\n    \\laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    In this scenario, we can assume that\n    $k$ balls are initially placed in boxes\n    and there is an empty box between each\n    two adjacent boxes.\n    The remaining task is to choose the\n    positions for the remaining empty boxes.\n    There are $n-2k+1$ such boxes and\n    $k+1$ positions for them.\n    Thus, using the formula of scenario 2,\n    the number of solutions is\n    ${n-k+1 \\choose n-2k+1}$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Multinomial coefficients}\n\n    \\index{multinomial coefficient}\n\n    The \\key{multinomial coefficient}\n    \\[ {n \\choose k_1,k_2,\\ldots,k_m} = \\frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! \\cdots k_m!}, \\]\n    equals the number of ways\n    we can divide $n$ elements into subsets\n    of sizes $k_1,k_2,\\ldots,k_m$,\n    where $k_1+k_2+\\cdots+k_m=n$.\n    Multinomial coefficients can be seen as a\n    generalization of binomial cofficients;\n    if $m=2$, the above formula\n    corresponds to the binomial coefficient formula.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
