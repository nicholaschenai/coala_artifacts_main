INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/592 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the products of consecutive binomial coefficients for a given integer `n`. The binomial coefficient, often represented as C(n, k), gives the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements. The function should return the total sum of the products of these coefficients for all consecutive pairs from 0 to `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Calculate the binomial coefficients for the given `n`.
   - For each pair of consecutive coefficients, compute their product.
   - Sum all these products together to get the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_Of_product(n):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for k from 0 to n-1:
           calculate C(n, k) and C(n, k+1)
           product = C(n, k) * C(n, k+1)
           add product to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def binomial_coefficient(n, k):
    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    if k == 0 or k == n:
        return 1
    # Use a multiplicative approach to calculate C(n, k)

        # Add the product to the total sum
        total_sum += product
    # Return the final sum
    return total_sum

    Part: 1/2
    \chapter{Combinatorics}

    \index{combinatorics}

    \key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting
    combinations of objects.
    Usually, the goal is to find a way to
    count the combinations efficiently
    without generating each combination separately.

    As an example, consider the problem
    of counting the number of ways to
    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.
    For example, there are 8 representations
    for $4$:
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1+1+1+1$
    \item $1+1+2$
    \item $1+2+1$
    \item $2+1+1$
    \item $2+2$
    \item $3+1$
    \item $1+3$
    \item $4$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}

    A combinatorial problem can often be solved
    using a recursive function.
    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$
    that gives the number of representations for $n$.
    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.
    The values of the function
    can be recursively calculated as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        f(n) = \begin{cases}
                   1               & n = 0\\
                   f(0)+f(1)+\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case is $f(0)=1$,
    because the empty sum represents the number 0.
    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to
    choose the first number of the sum.
    If the first number is $k$,
    there are $f(n-k)$ representations
    for the remaining part of the sum.
    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values
    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.

    The first values for the function are:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    f(0) & = & 1 \\
    f(1) & = & 1 \\
    f(2) & = & 2 \\
    f(3) & = & 4 \\
    f(4) & = & 8 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced
    with a closed-form formula.
    In this problem,
    \[
    f(n)=2^{n-1},
    \]
    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$
    possible positions for +-signs in the sum
    and we can choose any subset of them.

    \section{Binomial coefficients}

    \index{binomial coefficient}

    The \key{binomial coefficient} ${n \choose k}$
    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset
    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.
    For example, ${5 \choose 3}=10$,
    because the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:
    \[ \{1,2,3\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,2,5\}, \{1,3,4\}, \{1,3,5\}, 
    \{1,4,5\}, \{2,3,4\}, \{2,3,5\}, \{2,4,5\}, \{3,4,5\} \]

    \subsubsection{Formula 1}

    Binomial coefficients can be
    recursively calculated as follows:

    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}
    \]

    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.
    If $x$ is included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k-1$
    elements from $n-1$ elements,
    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.

    The base cases for the recursion are
    \[
    {n \choose 0}  =  {n \choose n} = 1,
    \]
    because there is always exactly
    one way to construct an empty subset
    and a subset that contains all the elements.

    \subsubsection{Formula 2}

    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.
    \]

    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.
    We go through all permutations and always
    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation
    in the subset.
    Since the order of the elements in the subset
    and outside the subset does not matter,
    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$

    \subsubsection{Properties}

    For binomial coefficients,
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n \choose n-k},
    \]
    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into
    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements
    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.

    The sum of binomial coefficients is
    \[
    {n \choose 0}+{n \choose 1}+{n \choose 2}+\ldots+{n \choose n}=2^n.
    \]

    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''
    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to
    the $n$th power:

    \[ (a+b)^n =
    {n \choose 0} a^n b^0 + 
    {n \choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +
    \ldots + 
    {n \choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +
    {n \choose n} a^0 b^n. \]

    \index{Pascal's triangle}

    Binomial coefficients also appear in
    \key{Pascal's triangle}
    where each value equals the sum of two
    above values:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}{0.9}
    \node at (0,0) {1};
    \node at (-0.5,-0.5) {1};
    \node at (0.5,-0.5) {1};
    \node at (-1,-1) {1};
    \node at (0,-1) {2};
    \node at (1,-1) {1};
    \node at (-1.5,-1.5) {1};
    \node at (-0.5,-1.5) {3};
    \node at (0.5,-1.5) {3};
    \node at (1.5,-1.5) {1};
    \node at (-2,-2) {1};
    \node at (-1,-2) {4};
    \node at (0,-2) {6};

    \node at (1,-2.5) {$\ldots$};
    \node at (2,-2.5) {$\ldots$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Boxes and balls}

    ''Boxes and balls'' is a useful model,
    where we count the ways to
    place $k$ balls in $n$ boxes.
    Let us consider three scenarios:

    \textit{Scenario 1}: Each box can contain
    at most one ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 10 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --
                        (#1+0.5,#2-0.5) -- (#1+0.5,#2+0.5);
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{
        \lax{#1}{#2}{#3}
        \lax{#1+1.2}{#2}{#4}
        \lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}
        \lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}
        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{-4}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    In this scenario, the answer is directly the
    binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 2}: A box can contain multiple balls.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 15 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --

    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }

    }

    \laa{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-8}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-6}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{-8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}

    \laa{16}{-8}{0}{0}{0}{0}{2}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The process of placing the balls in the boxes
    can be represented as a string
    that consists of symbols
    ''o'' and ''$\rightarrow$''.
    Initially, assume that we are standing at the leftmost box.
    The symbol ''o'' means that we place a ball
    in the current box, and the symbol
    ''$\rightarrow$'' means that we move to
    the next box to the right.

    Using this notation, each solution is a string
    that contains $k$ times the symbol ''o'' and
    $n-1$ times the symbol ''$\rightarrow$''.
    For example, the upper-right solution
    in the above picture corresponds to the string
    ''$\rightarrow$ $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$''.
    Thus, the number of solutions is
    ${k+n-1 \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 3}: Each box may contain at most one ball,
    and in addition, no two adjacent boxes may both contain a ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2

    Part: 1/2
    # Binomial Coefficients

    Binomial coefficients $\binom n k$ are the number of ways to select a set of $k$ elements from $n$ different elements without taking into account the order of arrangement of these elements (i.e., the number of unordered sets).

    Binomial coefficients are also the coefficients in the expansion of $(a + b) ^ n$ (so-called binomial theorem):

    $$ (a+b)^n = \binom n 0 a^n + \binom n 1 a^{n-1} b + \binom n 2 a^{n-2} b^2 + \cdots + \binom n k a^{n-k} b^k + \cdots + \binom n n b^n $$

    It is believed that this formula, as well as the triangle which allows efficient calculation of the coefficients, was discovered by Blaise Pascal in the 17th century. Nevertheless, it was known to the Chinese mathematician Yang Hui, who lived in the 13th century. Perhaps it was discovered by a Persian scholar Omar Khayyam. Moreover, Indian mathematician Pingala, who lived  earlier in the 3rd. BC, got similar results. The merit of the Newton is that he generalized this formula for exponents that are not natural.

    ## Calculation

    **Analytic formula** for the calculation:

    $$ \binom n k = \frac {n!} {k!(n-k)!} $$

    This formula can be easily deduced from the problem of ordered arrangement (number of ways to select $k$ different elements from $n$ different elements). First, let's count the number of ordered selections of $k$ elements. There are $n$ ways to select the first element, $n-1$ ways to select the second element, $n-2$ ways to select the third element, and so on. As a result, we get the formula of the number of ordered arrangements: $n (n-1) (n-2) \cdots (n - k + 1) = \frac {n!} {(n-k)!}$. We can easily move to unordered arrangements, noting that each unordered arrangement corresponds to exactly $k!$ ordered arrangements ($k!$ is the number of possible permutations of $k$ elements). We get the final formula by dividing $\frac {n!} {(n-k)!}$ by $k!$.

    **Recurrence formula** (which is associated with the famous "Pascal's Triangle"):

    $$ \binom n k = \binom {n-1} {k-1} + \binom {n-1} k $$

    It is easy to deduce this using the analytic formula.

    Note that for $n \lt k$ the value of $\binom n k$ is assumed to be zero.

    ## Properties

    Binomial coefficients have many different properties. Here are the simplest of them:

    *   Symmetry rule:

        \[ \binom n k = \binom n {n-k} \]

    *   Factoring in:

        \[ \binom n k = \frac n k \binom {n-1} {k-1} \]

    *   Sum over $k$:

        \[ \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom n k = 2 ^ n \]

    *   Sum over $n$:

        \[ \sum_{m = 0}^n \binom m k = \binom {n + 1} {k + 1} \]

    *   Sum over $n$ and $k$:

        \[ \sum_{k = 0}^m  \binom {n + k} k = \binom {n + m + 1} m \]

    *   Sum of the squares:

        \[ {\binom n 0}^2 + {\binom n 1}^2 + \cdots + {\binom n n}^2 = \binom {2n} n \]

    *   Weighted sum:

        \[ 1 \binom n 1 + 2 \binom n 2 + \cdots + n \binom n n = n 2^{n-1} \]

    *   Connection with the [Fibonacci numbers](../algebra/fibonacci-numbers.md):

        \[ \binom n 0 + \binom {n-1} 1 + \cdots + \binom {n-k} k + \cdots + \binom 0 n = F_{n+1} \]

    ## Calculation

    ### Straightforward calculation using analytical formula

    The first, straightforward formula is very easy to code, but this method is likely to overflow even for relatively small values of $n$ and $k$ (even if the answer completely fit into some datatype, the calculation of the intermediate factorials can lead to overflow). Therefore, this method often can only be used with [long arithmetic](../algebra/big-integer.md):

    ```cpp
    int C(int n, int k) {
        int res = 1;
        for (int i = n - k + 1; i <= n; ++i)
            res *= i;
        for (int i = 2; i <= k; ++i)
            res /= i;
        return res;
    }
    ```

    ### Improved implementation

    Note that in the above implementation numerator and denominator have the same number of factors ($k$), each of which is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, we can replace our fraction with a product $k$ fractions, each of which is real-valued. However, on each step after multiplying current answer by each of the next fractions the answer will still be integer (this follows from the property of factoring in). 

    C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int C(int n, int k) {
        double res = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i)
            res = res * (n - k + i) / i;
        return (int)(res + 0.01);
    }
    ```

    Here we carefully cast the floating point number to an integer, taking into account that due to the accumulated errors, it may be slightly less than the true value (for example, $2.99999$ instead of $3$).

    ### Pascal's Triangle

    By using the recurrence relation we can construct a table of binomial coefficients (Pascal's triangle) and take the result from it. The advantage of this method is that intermediate results never exceed the answer and calculating each new table element requires only one addition. The flaw is slow execution for large $n$ and $k$ if you just need a single value and not the whole table (because in order to calculate $\binom n k$ you will need to build a table of all $\binom i j, 1 \le i \le n, 1 \le j \le n$, or at least to $1 \le j \le \min (i, 2k)$). The time complexity can be considered to be $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.

    C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    const int maxn = ...;
    int C[maxn + 1][maxn + 1];
    C[0][0] = 1;
    for (int n = 1; n <= maxn; ++n) {
        C[n][0] = C[n][n] = 1;
        for (int k = 1; k < n; ++k)
            C[n][k] = C[n - 1][k - 1] + C[n - 1][k];
    }
    ```

    If the entire table of values is not necessary, storing only two last rows of it is sufficient (current $n$-th row and the previous $n-1$-th).

    ### Calculation in $O(1)$ {data-toc-label="Calculation in O(1)"}

    Finally, in some situations it is beneficial to precompute all the factorials in order to produce any necessary binomial coefficient with only two divisions later. This can be advantageous when using [long arithmetic](../algebra/big-integer.md), when the memory does not allow precomputation of the whole Pascal's triangle.


    ## Computing binomial coefficients modulo $m$ {data-toc-label="Computing binomial coefficients modulo m"}

    Quite often you come across the problem of computing binomial coefficients modulo some $m$.

    ### Binomial coefficient for small $n$ {data-toc-label="Binomial coefficient for small n"}

    The previously discussed approach of Pascal's triangle can be used to calculate all values of $\binom{n}{k} \bmod m$ for reasonably small $n$, since it requires time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. This approach can handle any modulo, since only addition operations are used.


    ### Binomial coefficient modulo large prime

    The formula for the binomial coefficients is

    $$\binom n k = \frac {n!} {k!(n-k)!},$$

    so if we want to compute it modulo some prime $m > n$ we get

    $$\binom n k \equiv n! \cdot (k!)^{-1} \cdot ((n-k)!)^{-1} \mod m.$$

    First we precompute all factorials modulo $m$ up to $\text{MAXN}!$ in $O(\text{MAXN})$ time.

    ```cpp
    factorial[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {
        factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % m;
    }
    ```

    And afterwards we can compute the binomial coefficient in $O(\log m)$ time.

    ```cpp
    long long binomial_coefficient(int n, int k) {
        return factorial[n] * inverse(factorial[k] * factorial[n - k] % m) % m;
    }
    ```

    We even can compute the binomial coefficient in $O(1)$ time if we precompute the inverses of all factorials in $O(\text{MAXN} \log m)$ using the regular method for computing the inverse, or even in $O(\text{MAXN})$ time using the congruence $(x!)^{-1} \equiv ((x-1)!)^{-1} \cdot x^{-1}$ and the method for [computing all inverses](../algebra/module-inverse.md#mod-inv-all-num) in $O(n)$.

    ```cpp
    long long binomial_coefficient(int n, int k) {
        return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % m * inverse_factorial[n - k] % m;
    }

    In this scenario, we can assume that
    $k$ balls are initially placed in boxes
    and there is an empty box between each
    two adjacent boxes.
    The remaining task is to choose the
    positions for the remaining empty boxes.
    There are $n-2k+1$ such boxes and
    $k+1$ positions for them.
    Thus, using the formula of scenario 2,
    the number of solutions is
    ${n-k+1 \choose n-2k+1}$.

    \subsubsection{Multinomial coefficients}

    \index{multinomial coefficient}

    The \key{multinomial coefficient}
    \[ {n \choose k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m} = \frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! \cdots k_m!}, \]
    equals the number of ways
    we can divide $n$ elements into subsets
    of sizes $k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m$,
    where $k_1+k_2+\cdots+k_m=n$.
    Multinomial coefficients can be seen as a
    generalization of binomial cofficients;
    if $m=2$, the above formula
    corresponds to the binomial coefficient formula.
