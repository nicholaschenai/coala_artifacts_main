    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist that has the maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, we will return the first one encountered.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each sublist in the input list. For each sublist, we will check its length. We will keep track of the longest sublist found so far and update our record whenever we find a longer sublist. At the end of the iteration, we will return the longest sublist.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n       max_length = 0\n       max_list = []\n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           if length of sublist > max_length:\n               max_length = length of sublist\n               max_list = sublist\n       return max_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum length and the corresponding sublist\n    max_length = 0\n    max_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Check if the current sublist is longer than the maximum found so far\n        if len(sublist) > max_length:\n            # Update the maximum length and the longest sublist\n            max_length = len(sublist)\n            max_list = sublist\n            \n    # Return the longest sublist found\n    return max_list\n```",
