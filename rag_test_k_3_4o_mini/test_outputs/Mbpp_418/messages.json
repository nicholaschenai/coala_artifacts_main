example\n\n        $$\\begin{array}{ll}\n        a &= \\{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\\} \\\\\n        d &= \\{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\\}\n        \\end{array}$$\n\n        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\\{3, 4, 5\\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\\}$ or $\\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\\{0, 1\\}$ having length 2.\n\n    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.\n    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.\n\n    So let the current index be $i$.\n    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \\dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.\n    Then there are two options:\n\n    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.\n\n    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.\n        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.\n\n        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.\n        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.\n  \n        $$d[i] = \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(1, \\max_{\\substack{j < i \\\\\\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \\left(d[j] + 1\\right)\\right)$$\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {\n                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;\n                    p[i] = j;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if (d[i] > ans) {\n                ans = d[i];\n                pos = i;\n            }\n        }\n\n        vector<int> subseq;\n        while (pos != -1) {\n            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);\n            pos = p[pos];\n        }\n        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());\n        return subseq;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Finding the largest zero submatrix\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Finding the largest zero submatrix\n\n    You are given a matrix with `n` rows and `m` columns. Find the largest submatrix consisting of only zeros (a submatrix is a rectangular area of the matrix).\n\n    ## Algorithm\n\n    Elements of the matrix will be `a[i][j]`, where `i = 0...n - 1`, `j = 0... m - 1`. For simplicity, we will consider all non-zero elements equal to 1.\n\n    ### Step 1: Auxiliary dynamic\n\n    First, we calculate the following auxiliary matrix: `d[i][j]`, nearest row that has a 1 above `a[i][j]`. Formally speaking, `d[i][j]` is the largest row number (from `0` to `i - 1`), in which there is a element equal to `1` in the `j`-th column. \n    While iterating from top-left to bottom-right, when we stand in row `i`, we know the values from the previous row, so, it is enough to update just the elements with value `1`. We can save the values in a simple array `d[i]`, `i = 1...m - 1`, because in the further algorithm we will process the matrix one row at a time and only need the values of the current row.\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> d(m, -1);\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {\n            if (a[i][j] == 1) {\n                d[j] = i;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Step 2: Problem solving\n\n    We can solve the problem in $O(n m^2)$ iterating through rows, considering every possible left and right columns for a submatrix. The bottom of the rectangle will be the current row, and using `d[i][j]` we can find the top row. However, it is possible to go further and significantly improve the complexity of the solution.\n\n    It is clear that the desired zero submatrix is bounded on all four sides by some ones, which prevent it from increasing in size and improving the answer. Therefore,  we will not miss the answer if we act as follows: for every cell `j` in row `i` (the bottom row of a potential zero submatrix) we will have `d[i][j]` as the top row of the current zero submatrix. It now remains to determine the optimal left and right boundaries of the zero submatrix, i.e. maximally push this submatrix to the left and right of the `j`-th column. \n\n    What does it mean to push the maximum to the left? It means to find an index `k1` for which `d[i][k1] > d[i][j]`, and at the same time `k1` - the closest one to the left of the index `j`. It is clear that then `k1 + 1` gives the number of the left column of the required zero submatrix. If there is no such index at all, then put `k1` = `-1`(this means that we were able to extend the current zero submatrix to the left all the way to the border of matrix `a`).\n\n    Symmetrically, you can define an index `k2` for the right border: this is the closest index to the right of `j` such that `d[i][k2] > d[i][j]` (or `m`, if there is no such index).\n\n    So, the indices `k1` and `k2`, if we learn to search for them effectively, will give us all the necessary information about the current zero submatrix. In particular, its area will be equal to `(i - d[i][j]) * (k2 - k1 - 1)`.\n\n    How to look for these indexes `k1` and `k2` effectively with fixed `i` and `j`? We can do that in $O(1)$ on average.\n\n    To achieve such complexity, you can use the stack as follows. Let's first learn how to search for an index `k1`, and save its value for each index `j` within the current row `i` in matrix `d1[i][j]`. To do this, we will look through all the columns `j` from left to right, and we will store in the stack only those columns that have `d[][]` strictly greater than `d[i][j]`. It is clear that when moving from a column `j` to the next column, it is necessary to update the content of the stack. When there is an inappropriate element at the top of the stack (i.e. `d[][] <= d[i][j]`) pop it. It is easy to understand that it is enough to remove from the stack only from its top, and from none of its other places (because the stack will contain an increasing `d` sequence of columns).\n\n    The value `d1[i][j]` for each `j` will be equal to the value lying at that moment on top of the stack.\n\n    The dynamics `d2[i][j]` for finding the indices `k2` is considered similar, only you need to view the columns from right to left.\n\n    It is clear that since there are exactly `m` pieces added to the stack on each line, there could not be more deletions either, the sum of complexities will be linear, so the final complexity of the algorithm is $O(nm)$.\n\n    It should also be noted that this algorithm consumes $O(m)$ memory (not counting the input data - the matrix `a[][]`).\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n    int zero_matrix(vector<vector<int>> a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        int m = a[0].size();\n\n        int ans = 0;\n        vector<int> d(m, -1), d1(m), d2(m);\n        stack<int> st;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {\n                if (a[i][j] == 1)\n                    d[j] = i;\n            }\n\n            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {\n                while (!st.empty() && d[st.top()] <= d[j])\n                    st.pop();\n                d1[j] = st.empty() ? -1 : st.top();\n                st.push(j);\n            }\n            while (!st.empty())\n                st.pop();\n\n            for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; --j) {\n                while (!st.empty() && d[st.top()] <= d[j])\n                    st.pop();\n                d2[j] = st.empty() ? m : st.top();\n                st.push(j);\n            }\n            while (!st.empty())\n                st.pop();\n\n            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j)\n                ans = max(ans, (i - d[j]) * (d2[j] - d1[j] - 1));\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Dynamic programming\n    Section: Longest increasing subsequence\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Longest increasing subsequence}\n\n    \\index{longest increasing subsequence}\n\n    Our first problem is to find the\n    \\key{longest increasing subsequence}\n    in an array of $n$ elements.\n    This is a maximum-length\n    sequence of array elements\n    that goes from left to right,\n    and each element in the sequence is larger\n    than the previous element.\n    For example, in the array\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$3$};\n\n    \\footnotesize\n    \\node at (0.5,1.4) {$0$};\n    \\node at (1.5,1.4) {$1$};\n    \\node at (2.5,1.4) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,1.4) {$3$};\n    \\node at (4.5,1.4) {$4$};\n    \\node at (5.5,1.4) {$5$};\n    \\node at (6.5,1.4) {$6$};\n    \\node at (7.5,1.4) {$7$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    the longest increasing subsequence\n    contains 4 elements:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (2,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (2,0) rectangle (3,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (4,0) rectangle (5,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (6,0) rectangle (7,1);\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$3$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (1.5,-0.25) .. controls (1.75,-1.00) and (2.25,-1.00) ..

At the end of the iteration, we will return the longest sublist.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n       max_length = 0\n       max_list = []\n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           if length of sublist > max_length:\n               max_length = length of sublist\n               max_list = sublist\n       return max_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum length and the corresponding sublist\n    max_length = 0\n    max_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Check if the current sublist is longer than the maximum found so far\n        if len(sublist) > max_length:\n            # Update the maximum length and the longest sublist\n            max_length = len(sublist)\n            max_list = sublist\n            \n    # Return the longest sublist found\n    return max_list\n```"
