INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/64 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a subject name and a corresponding score. The function should sort these tuples based on the score (the second element of each tuple) in ascending order and return the sorted list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in sorting capabilities of Python. We will define a function that takes the list of tuples as input. We will then sort the list using a key that specifies we want to sort by the second element of each tuple. Finally, we will return the sorted list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function subject_marks that takes a list of tuples as input
   Use the sort method on the list with a key that extracts the second element of each tuple
   Return the sorted list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def subject_marks(marks):
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple
    marks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    # Return the sorted list
    return marks

    \index{sorting}

    \key{Sorting}
    is a fundamental algorithm design problem.
    Many efficient algorithms
    use sorting as a subroutine,
    because it is often easier to process
    data if the elements are in a sorted order.

    For example, the problem ''does an array contain
    two equal elements?'' is easy to solve using sorting.
    If the array contains two equal elements,
    they will be next to each other after sorting,
    so it is easy to find them.
    Also, the problem ''what is the most frequent element
    in an array?'' can be solved similarly.

    There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are
    also good examples of how to apply
    different algorithm design techniques.
    The efficient general sorting algorithms
    work in $O(n \log n)$ time,
    and many algorithms that use sorting
    as a subroutine also
    have this time complexity.

    \section{Sorting theory}

    The basic problem in sorting is as follows:
    \begin{framed}
    \noindent
    Given an array that contains $n$ elements,
    your task is to sort the elements
    in increasing order.
    \end{framed}
    \noindent
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    will be as follows after sorting:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};

    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{$O(n^2)$ algorithms}

    \index{bubble sort}

    Simple algorithms for sorting an array
    work in $O(n^2)$ time.
    Such algorithms are short and usually
    consist of two nested loops.
    A famous $O(n^2)$ time sorting algorithm
    is \key{bubble sort} where the elements
    ''bubble'' in the array according to their values.

    Bubble sort consists of $n$ rounds.
    On each round, the algorithm iterates through
    the elements of the array.
    Whenever two consecutive elements are found
    that are not in correct order,
    the algorithm swaps them.
    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) {
            if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
                swap(array[j],array[j+1]);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    After the first round of the algorithm,
    the largest element will be in the correct position,
    and in general, after $k$ rounds, the $k$ largest
    elements will be in the correct positions.
    Thus, after $n$ rounds, the whole array
    will be sorted.

    For example, in the array

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};

    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \noindent
    the first round of bubble sort swaps elements
    as follows:

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Inversions}

    \index{inversion}

    Bubble sort is an example of a sorting
    algorithm that always swaps \emph{consecutive}
    elements in the array.
    It turns out that the time complexity
    of such an algorithm is \emph{always}
    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,
    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.

    A useful concept when analyzing sorting
    algorithms is an \key{inversion}:
    a pair of array elements
    $(\texttt{array}[a],\texttt{array}[b])$ such that
    $a<b$ and $\texttt{array}[a]>\texttt{array}[b]$,
    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    has three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.
    The number of inversions indicates
    how much work is needed to sort the array.
    An array is completely sorted when
    there are no inversions.
    On the other hand, if the array elements
    are in the reverse order,
    the number of inversions is the largest possible:
    \[1+2+\cdots+(n-1)=\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\]

    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are
    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion
    from the array.
    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only
    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes
    at most one inversion, and the time complexity
    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{$O(n \log n)$ algorithms}

    \index{merge sort}

    It is possible to sort an array efficiently
    in $O(n \log n)$ time using algorithms
    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.
    One such algorithm is \key{merge sort}\footnote{According to \cite{knu983},
    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},
    which is based on recursion.

    Merge sort sorts a subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$ as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.
    \item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\lfloor (a+b)/2 \rfloor$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$.
    \item \emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and
    \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    into a sorted subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$.
    \end{enumerate}

    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it
    halves the size of the subarray at each step.
    The recursion consists of $O(\log n)$ levels,
    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.
    Merging the subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.

    For example, consider sorting the following array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};

    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9

    Chapter: Sorting
    Section: Sorting in C++
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Sorting in C++}

    \index{sort@\texttt{sort}}

    It is almost never a good idea to use
    a home-made sorting algorithm
    in a contest, because there are good
    implementations available in programming languages.
    For example, the C++ standard library contains
    the function \texttt{sort} that can be easily used for
    sorting arrays and other data structures.

    There are many benefits in using a library function.
    First, it saves time because there is no need to
    implement the function.
    Second, the library implementation is
    certainly correct and efficient: it is not probable
    that a home-made sorting function would be better.

    In this section we will see how to use the
    C++ \texttt{sort} function.
    The following code sorts
    a vector in increasing order:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    vector<int> v = {4,2,5,3,5,8,3};
    sort(v.begin(),v.end());
    \end{lstlisting}
    After the sorting, the contents of the
    vector will be
    $[2,3,3,4,5,5,8]$.
    The default sorting order is increasing,
    but a reverse order is possible as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    sort(v.rbegin(),v.rend());
    \end{lstlisting}
    An ordinary array can be sorted as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int n = 7; // array size
    int a[] = {4,2,5,3,5,8,3};
    sort(a,a+n);
    \end{lstlisting}
    \newpage
    The following code sorts the string \texttt{s}:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    string s = "monkey";
    sort(s.begin(), s.end());
    \end{lstlisting}
    Sorting a string means that the characters
    of the string are sorted.
    For example, the string ''monkey'' becomes ''ekmnoy''.

    \subsubsection{Comparison operators}

    \index{comparison operator}

    The function \texttt{sort} requires that
    a \key{comparison operator} is defined for the data type
    of the elements to be sorted.
    When sorting, this operator will be used
    whenever it is necessary to find out the order of two elements.

    Most C++ data types have a built-in comparison operator,
    and elements of those types can be sorted automatically.
    For example, numbers are sorted according to their values
    and strings are sorted in alphabetical order.

    \index{pair@\texttt{pair}}

    Pairs (\texttt{pair}) are sorted primarily according to their
    first elements (\texttt{first}).
    However, if the first elements of two pairs are equal,
    they are sorted according to their second elements (\texttt{second}):
    \begin{lstlisting}
    vector<pair<int,int>> v;
    v.push_back({1,5});
    v.push_back({2,3});
    v.push_back({1,2});
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this, the order of the pairs is
    $(1,2)$, $(1,5)$ and $(2,3)$.

    \index{tuple@\texttt{tuple}}

    In a similar way, tuples (\texttt{tuple})
    are sorted primarily by the first element,
    secondarily by the second element, etc.\footnote{Note that in some older compilers,
    the function \texttt{make\_tuple} has to be used to create a tuple instead of
    braces (for example, \texttt{make\_tuple(2,1,4)} instead of \texttt{\{2,1,4\}}).}:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    vector<tuple<int,int,int>> v;
    v.push_back({2,1,4});
    v.push_back({1,5,3});
    v.push_back({2,1,3});
    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this, the order of the tuples is
    $(1,5,3)$, $(2,1,3)$ and $(2,1,4)$.

    \subsubsection{User-defined structs}

    User-defined structs do not have a comparison
    operator automatically.
    The operator should be defined inside
    the struct as a function
    \texttt{operator<},
    whose parameter is another element of the same type.
    The operator should return \texttt{true}
    if the element is smaller than the parameter,
    and \texttt{false} otherwise.

    For example, the following struct \texttt{P}
    contains the x and y coordinates of a point.
    The comparison operator is defined so that
    the points are sorted primarily by the x coordinate
    and secondarily by the y coordinate.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    struct P {
        int x, y;
        bool operator<(const P &p) {
            if (x != p.x) return x < p.x;
            else return y < p.y;
        }
    };
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Comparison functions}

    \index{comparison function}

    It is also possible to give an external
    \key{comparison function} to the \texttt{sort} function
    as a callback function.
    For example, the following comparison function \texttt{comp}
    sorts strings primarily by length and secondarily
    by alphabetical order:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    bool comp(string a, string b) {
        if (a.size() != b.size()) return a.size() < b.size();
        return a < b;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    Now a vector of strings can be sorted as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), comp);
    \end{lstlisting}

    $};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The array will be divided into two subarrays
    as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,1);
    \draw (5,0) grid (9,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};

    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Then, the subarrays will be sorted recursively
    as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,1);
    \draw (5,0) grid (9,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};

    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Finally, the algorithm merges the sorted
    subarrays and creates the final sorted array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Sorting lower bound}

    Is it possible to sort an array faster
    than in $O(n \log n)$ time?
    It turns out that this is \emph{not} possible
    when we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms
    that are based on comparing array elements.

    The lower bound for the time complexity
    can be proved by considering sorting
    as a process where each comparison of two elements
    gives more information about the contents of the array.
    The process creates the following tree:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) rectangle (3,1);
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (-2.5,-1.5);
    \draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (5.5,-1.5);

    \draw (-4,-2.5) rectangle (-1,-1.5);
    \draw (4,-2.5) rectangle (7,-1.5);
    \node at (-2.5,-2) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (5.5,-2) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-4.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-0.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (3.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (7.5,-4);

    \draw (-6,-5) rectangle (-3,-4);
    \draw (-2,-5) rectangle (1,-4);
    \draw (2,-5) rectangle (5,-4);
    \draw (6,-5) rectangle (9,-4);
    \node at (-4.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (-0.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (3.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (7.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-5.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-3.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (0.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (-1.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (2.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (4.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (6.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (8.5,-6);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Here ''$x<y?$'' means that some elements
    $x$ and $y$ are compared.
    If $x<y$, the process continues to the left,
    and otherwise to the right.
    The results of the process are the possible
    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.
    For this reason, the height of the tree
    must be at least
    \[ \log_2(n!) = \log_2(1)+\log_2(2)+\cdots+\log_2(n).\]
    We get a lower bound for this sum
    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and
    changing the value of each element to $\log_2(n/2)$.
    This yields an estimate
    \[ \log_2(n!) \ge (n/2) \cdot \log_2(n/2),\]
    so the height of the tree and the minimum
    possible number of steps in a sorting
    algorithm in the worst case
    is at least $n \log n$.

    \subsubsection{Counting sort}

    \index{counting sort}

    The lower bound $n \log n$ does not apply to
    algorithms that do not compare array elements
    but use some other information.
    An example of such an algorithm is
    \key{counting sort} that sorts an array in
    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array
    is an integer between $0 \ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.

    The algorithm creates a \emph{bookkeeping} array,
    whose indices are elements of the original array.
    The algorithm iterates through the original array
    and calculates how many times each element
    appears in the array.
    \newpage

    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    corresponds to the following bookkeeping array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (9,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$3$};

    \footnotesize

    \node at (0.5,1.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,1.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,1.5) {$3$};
    \node at (3.5,1.5) {$4$};
    \node at (4.5,1.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,1.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,1.5) {$7$};
    \node at (7.5,1.5) {$8$};
    \node at (8.5,1.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    For example, the value at position 3
    in the bookkeeping array is 2,
    because the element 3 appears 2 times
    in the original array.

    Construction of the bookkeeping array
    takes $O(n)$ time. After this, the sorted array
    can be created in $O(n)$ time because
    the number of occurrences of each element can be retrieved
    from the bookkeeping array.
    Thus, the total time complexity of counting
    sort is $O(n)$.

    Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm
    but it can only be used when the constant $c$
    is small enough, so that the array elements can
    be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/64 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a subject name and a corresponding score. The function should sort these tuples based on the score (the second element of each tuple) in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can use a sorting algorithm that compares the second element of each tuple. We will iterate through the list of tuples and compare the scores, rearranging the tuples accordingly until the entire list is sorted.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function subject_marks(marks):
       for i from 0 to length of marks - 1:
           for j from 0 to length of marks - i - 2:
               if marks[j][1] > marks[j + 1][1]:
                   swap marks[j] and marks[j + 1]
       return marks
   ```
