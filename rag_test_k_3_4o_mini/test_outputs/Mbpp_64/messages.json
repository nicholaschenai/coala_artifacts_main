\\emph{consecutive}\n    elements in the array.\n    It turns out that the time complexity\n    of such an algorithm is \\emph{always}\n    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,\n    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.\n\n    A useful concept when analyzing sorting\n    algorithms is an \\key{inversion}:\n    a pair of array elements\n    $(\\texttt{array}[a],\\texttt{array}[b])$ such that\n    $a<b$ and $\\texttt{array}[a]>\\texttt{array}[b]$,\n    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at

three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.\n    The number of inversions indicates\n    how much work is needed to sort the array.\n    An array is completely sorted when\n    there are no inversions.\n    On the other hand, if the array elements\n    are in the reverse order,\n    the number of inversions is the largest possible:\n    \\[1+2+\\cdots+(n-1)=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\\]\n\n    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are\n    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion\n    from the array.\n    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only\n    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes\n    at most one inversion, and the time complexity\n    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{$O(n \\log n)$ algorithms}\n\n    \\index{merge sort}\n\n    It is possible to sort an array efficiently\n    in $O(n \\log n)$ time using algorithms\n    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.\n    One such algorithm is \\key{merge sort}\\footnote{According to \\cite{knu983},\n    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},\n    which is based on recursion.\n\n    Merge sort sorts a subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$ as follows:\n\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.\n    \\item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\\lfloor (a+b)/2 \\rfloor$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$.\n    \\item \\emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and\n    \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    into a sorted subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it\n    halves the size of the subarray at each step.\n    The recursion consists of $O(\\log n)$ levels,\n    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.\n    Merging the subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.\n\n    For example, consider sorting the following array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at

Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Sorting\n    Section: Sorting in C++\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Sorting in C++}\n\n    \\index{sort@\\texttt{sort}}\n\n    It is almost never a good idea to use\n    a home-made sorting algorithm\n    in a contest, because there are good\n    implementations available in programming languages.\n    For example, the C++ standard library contains\n    the function \\texttt{sort} that can be easily used for\n    sorting arrays and other data structures.\n\n    There are many benefits in using a library function.\n    First, it saves time because there is no need to\n    implement the function.\n    Second, the library implementation is\n    certainly correct and efficient: it is not probable\n    that a home-made sorting function would be better.\n\n    In this section we will see how to use the\n    C++ \\texttt{sort} function.\n    The following code sorts\n    a vector in increasing order:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    vector<int> v = {4,2,5,3,5,8,3};\n    sort(v.begin(),v.end());\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After the sorting, the contents of the\n    vector will be\n    $[2,3,3,4,5,5,8]$.\n    The default sorting order is increasing,\n    but a reverse order is possible as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    sort(v.rbegin(),v.rend());\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    An ordinary array can be sorted as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int n = 7; // array size\n    int a[] = {4,2,5,3,5,8,3};\n    sort(a,a+n);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    \\newpage\n    The following code sorts the string \\texttt{s}:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    string s = \"monkey\";\n    sort(s.begin(), s.end());\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    Sorting a string means that the characters\n    of the string are sorted.\n    For example, the string ''monkey'' becomes ''ekmnoy''.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Comparison operators}\n\n    \\index{comparison operator}\n\n    The function \\texttt{sort} requires that\n    a \\key{comparison operator} is defined for the data type\n    of the elements to be sorted.\n    When sorting, this operator will be used\n    whenever it is necessary to find out the order of two elements.\n\n    Most C++ data types have a built-in comparison operator,\n    and elements of those types can be sorted automatically.\n    For example, numbers are sorted according to their values\n    and strings are sorted in alphabetical order.\n\n    \\index{pair@\\texttt{pair}}\n\n    Pairs (\\texttt{pair}) are sorted primarily according to their\n    first elements (\\texttt{first}).\n    However, if the first elements of two pairs are equal,\n    they are sorted according to their second elements (\\texttt{second}):\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    vector<pair<int,int>> v;\n    v.push_back({1,5});\n    v.push_back({2,3});\n    v.push_back({1,2});\n    sort(v.begin(), v.end());\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this, the order of the pairs is\n    $(1,2)$, $(1,5)$ and $(2,3)$.\n\n    \\index{tuple@\\texttt{tuple}}\n\n    In a similar way, tuples (\\texttt{tuple})\n    are sorted primarily by the first element,\n    secondarily by the second element, etc.\\footnote{Note that in some older compilers,\n    the function \\texttt{make\\_tuple} has to be used to create a tuple instead of\n    braces (for example, \\texttt{make\\_tuple(2,1,4)} instead of \\texttt{\\{2,1,4\\}}).}:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    vector<tuple<int,int,int>> v;\n    v.push_back({2,1,4});\n    v.push_back({1,5,3});\n    v.push_back({2,1,3});\n    sort(v.begin(), v.end());\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this, the order of the tuples is\n    $(1,5,3)$, $(2,1,3)$ and $(2,1,4)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{User-defined structs}\n\n    User-defined structs do not have a comparison\n    operator automatically.\n    The operator should be defined inside\n    the struct as a function\n    \\texttt{operator<},\n    whose parameter is another element of the same type.\n    The operator should return \\texttt{true}\n    if the element is smaller than the parameter,\n    and \\texttt{false} otherwise.\n\n    For example, the following struct \\texttt{P}\n    contains the x and y coordinates of a point.\n    The comparison operator is defined so that\n    the points are sorted primarily by the x coordinate\n    and secondarily by the y coordinate.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    struct P {\n        int x, y;\n        bool operator<(const P &p) {\n            if (x != p.x) return x < p.x;\n            else return y < p.y;\n        }\n    };\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Comparison functions}\n\n    \\index{comparison function}\n\n    It is also possible to give an external\n    \\key{comparison function} to the \\texttt{sort} function\n    as a callback function.\n    For example, the following comparison function \\texttt{comp}\n    sorts strings primarily by length and secondarily\n    by alphabetical order:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    bool comp(string a, string b) {\n        if (a.size() != b.size()) return a.size() < b.size();\n        return a < b;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    Now a vector of strings can be sorted as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), comp);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter:

we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms\n    that are based on comparing array elements.\n\n    The lower bound for the time complexity\n    can be proved by considering sorting\n    as a process where each comparison of two elements\n    gives more information about the contents of the array.\n    The process creates the following tree:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n

   \\draw (-4,-2.5) rectangle (-1,-1.5);\n    \\draw (4,-2.5) rectangle (7,-1.5);\n    \\node at (-2.5,-2) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (5.5,-2) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-4.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-0.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (3.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (7.5,-4);\n\n    \\draw (-6,-5) rectangle (-3,-4);\n    \\draw (-2,-5) rectangle (1,-4);\n    \\draw (2,-5) rectangle (5,-4);\n    \\draw (6,-5) rectangle (9,-4);\n    \\node at (-4.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (-0.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (3.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at (7.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-5.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-3.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (0.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (-1.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (2.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (4.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (6.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (8.5,-6);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Here ''$x<y?$'' means that some elements\n    $x$ and $y$ are compared.\n    If $x<y$, the process continues to the left,\n    and otherwise to the right.\n    The results of the process are the possible\n    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.\n    For this reason, the height of the tree\n    must be at least\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) = \\log_2(1)+\\log_2(2)+\\cdots+\\log_2(n).\\]\n    We get a lower bound for this sum\n    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and\n    changing the value of each element to $\\log_2(n/2)$.\n    This yields an estimate\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) \\ge (n/2) \\cdot \\log_2(n/2),\\]\n    so the height of the tree and the minimum\n    possible number of steps in a sorting\n    algorithm in the worst case\n    is at least $n \\log n$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Counting sort}\n\n    \\index{counting sort}\n\n    The lower bound $n \\log n$ does not apply to\n    algorithms that do not compare array elements\n    but use some other information.\n    An example of such an algorithm is\n    \\key{counting sort} that sorts an array in\n    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array\n    is an integer between $0 \\ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.\n\n    The algorithm creates a \\emph{bookkeeping} array,\n    whose indices are elements of the original array.\n    The algorithm iterates through the original array\n    and calculates how many times each element\n    appears in the array.\n    \\newpage\n\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    corresponds to the following bookkeeping array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (9,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$0$};\n    \\node at (8.5,0.5) {$3$};\n\n    \\footnotesize\n\n    \\node at (0.5,1.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,1.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,1.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (3.5,1.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (4.5,1.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (5.5,1.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (6.5,1.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (7.5,1.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (8.5,1.5) {$9$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    For example, the value at position 3\n    in the bookkeeping array is 2,\n    because the element 3 appears 2 times\n    in the original array.\n\n    Construction of the bookkeeping array\n    takes $O(n)$ time. After this, the sorted array\n    can be created in $O(n)$ time because\n    the number of occurrences of each element can be retrieved\n    from the bookkeeping array.\n    Thus, the total time complexity of counting\n    sort is $O(n)$.\n\n    Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm\n    but it can only be used when the constant $c$\n    is small enough, so that the array elements can\n    be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
