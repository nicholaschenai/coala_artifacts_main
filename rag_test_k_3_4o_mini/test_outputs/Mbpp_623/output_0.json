    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of numbers and raises each number in that list to a specified power, `n`. The function should return a new list containing the results of these calculations.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the input list, compute its power using the exponentiation operation, and store the results in a new list. Finally, we will return this new list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function nth_nums(numbers, n):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for each number in numbers:\n           calculate the number raised to the power of n\n           append the result to the result list\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef nth_nums(numbers, n):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Calculate the number raised to the power of n\n        powered_number = number ** n\n        # Append the result to the result list\n        result.append(powered_number)\n    \n    # Return the final list of powered numbers\n    return result\n```",
