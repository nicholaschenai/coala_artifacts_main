    Title: Binary Exponentiation
    Part: 1/2
    # Binary Exponentiation

    Binary exponentiation (also known as exponentiation by squaring) is a trick which allows to calculate $a^n$ using only $O(\log n)$ multiplications (instead of $O(n)$ multiplications required by the naive approach).

    It also has important applications in many tasks unrelated to arithmetic, since it
    can be used with any operations that have the property of **associativity**:

    $$(X \cdot Y) \cdot Z = X \cdot (Y \cdot Z)$$

    Most obviously this applies to modular multiplication, to multiplication of matrices and
    to other problems which we will discuss below.

    ## Algorithm

    Raising $a$ to the power of $n$ is expressed naively as multiplication by $a$ done $n - 1$ times:
    $a^{n} = a \cdot a \cdot \ldots \cdot a$. However, this approach is not practical for large $a$ or $n$.

    $a^{b+c} = a^b \cdot a^c$ and $a^{2b} = a^b \cdot a^b = (a^b)^2$.

    The idea of binary exponentiation is, that we split the work using the binary representation of the exponent.

    Let's write $n$ in base 2, for example:

    $$3^{13} = 3^{1101_2} = 3^8 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 3^1$$

    Since the number $n$ has exactly $\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor + 1$ digits in base 2, we only need to perform $O(\log n)$ multiplications, if we know the powers $a^1, a^2, a^4, a^8, \dots, a^{2^{\lfloor \log n \rfloor}}$.

    So we only need to know a fast way to compute those.
    Luckily this is very easy, since an element in the sequence is just the square of the previous element.

    $$\begin{align}
    3^1 &= 3 \\
    3^2 &= \left(3^1\right)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\
    3^4 &= \left(3^2\right)^2 = 9^2 = 81 \\
    3^8 &= \left(3^4\right)^2 = 81^2 = 6561
    \end{align}$$

    So to get the final answer for $3^{13}$, we only need to multiply three of them (skipping $3^2$ because the corresponding bit in $n$ is not set):
    $3^{13} = 6561 \cdot 81 \cdot 3 = 1594323$

    The final complexity of this algorithm is $O(\log n)$: we have to compute $\log n$ powers of $a$, and then have to do at most $\log n$ multiplications to get the final answer from them.

    The following recursive approach expresses the same idea:

    $$a^n = \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if } n == 0 \\
    \left(a^{\frac{n}{2}}\right)^2 &\text{if } n > 0 \text{ and } n \text{ even}\\
    \left(a^{\frac{n - 1}{2}}\right)^2 \cdot a &\text{if } n > 0 \text{ and } n \text{ odd}\\
    \end{cases}$$

    ## Implementation

    First the recursive approach, which is a direct translation of the recursive formula:

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
        if (b == 0)
            return 1;
        long long res = binpow(a, b / 2);
        if (b % 2)
            return res * res * a;
        else
            return res * res;
    }
    ```

    The second approach accomplishes the same task without recursion.
    It computes all the powers in a loop, and multiplies the ones with the corresponding set bit in $n$.
    Although the complexity of both approaches is identical, this approach will be faster in practice since we don't have the overhead of the recursive calls.

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
        long long res = 1;
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1)
                res = res * a;
            a = a * a;
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```

    ## Applications

    ### Effective computation of large exponents modulo a number

    **Problem:**
    Compute $x^n \bmod m$.
    This is a very common operation. For instance it is used in computing the [modular multiplicative inverse](module-inverse.md).

    **Solution:**
    Since we know that the modulo operator doesn't interfere with multiplications ($a \cdot b \equiv (a \bmod m) \cdot (b \bmod m) \pmod m$), we can directly use the same code, and just replace every multiplication with a modular multiplication:

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b, long long m) {
        a %= m;
        long long res = 1;
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1)
                res = res * a % m;
            a = a * a % m;
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```

    **Note:**
    It's possible to speed this algorithm for large $b >> m$.
    If $m$ is a prime number $x^n \equiv x^{n \bmod (m-1)} \pmod{m}$ for prime $m$, and $x^n \equiv x^{n \bmod{\phi(m)}} \pmod{m}$ for composite $m$.
    This follows directly from Fermat's little theorem and Euler's theorem, see the article about [Modular Inverses](module-inverse.md#fermat-euler) for more details.

    ### Effective computation of Fibonacci numbers

    **Problem:** Compute $n$-th Fibonacci number $F_n$.

    **Solution:** For more details, see the [Fibonacci Number article](fibonacci-numbers.md).
    We will only go through an overview of the algorithm.
    To compute the next Fibonacci number, only the two previous ones are needed, as $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
    We can build a $2 \times 2$ matrix that describes this transformation:
    the transition from $F_i$ and $F_{i+1}$ to $F_{i+1}$ and $F_{i+2}$.
    For example, applying this transformation to the pair $F_0$ and $F_1$ would change it into $F_1$ and $F_2$.
    Therefore, we can raise this transformation matrix to the $n$-th power to find $F_n$ in time complexity $O(\log n)$.

    ### Applying a permutation $k$ times { data-toc-label='Applying a permutation <script type="math/tex">k</script> times' }

    **Problem:** You are given a sequence of length $n$. Apply to it a given permutation $k$ times.

    **Solution:** Simply raise the permutation to $k$-th power using binary exponentiation, and then apply it to the sequence. This will give you a time complexity of $O(n \log k)$.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> applyPermutation(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation) {
        vector<int> newSequence(sequence.size());
        for(int i = 0; i < sequence.size(); i++) {
            newSequence[i] = sequence[permutation[i]];
        }
        return newSequence;
    }

    vector<int> permute(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation, long long b) {
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1) {
                sequence = applyPermutation(sequence, permutation);
            }
            permutation = applyPermutation(permutation, permutation);
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return sequence;
    }

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. 

    \subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \subsubsection{Euler's totient function}

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.
