    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes two tuples of integers as input and returns a new tuple. Each element in the new tuple is calculated by subtracting the corresponding elements of the second tuple from the first tuple. If the result is negative, it should be replaced with zero.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We will iterate through both tuples simultaneously, subtracting each element of the second tuple from the corresponding element of the first tuple. If the result of any subtraction is negative, we will replace it with zero. Finally, we will collect all the results into a new tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n       create an empty list result\n       for each index i from 0 to length of tuple1:\n           difference = tuple1[i] - tuple2[i]\n           if difference < 0:\n               append 0 to result\n           else:\n               append difference to result\n       return tuple(result)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through both tuples simultaneously\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Calculate the difference\n        difference = tuple1[i] - tuple2[i]\n        \n        # If the difference is negative, append 0, otherwise append the difference\n        if difference < 0:\n            result.append(0)\n        else:\n            result.append(difference)\n    \n    # Return the result as a tuple\n    return tuple(result)\n```",
