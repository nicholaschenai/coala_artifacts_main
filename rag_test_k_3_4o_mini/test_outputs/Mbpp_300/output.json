    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many binary sequences of length `2n` exist such that the sum of the first `n` bits is equal to the sum of the last `n` bits. \n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use combinatorial mathematics. The key insight is that for a binary sequence of length `2n`, the sum of the first `n` bits being equal to the sum of the last `n` bits means that both halves must have the same number of `1`s. If we denote the number of `1`s in each half as `k`, then the total number of `1`s in the sequence is `2k`. The number of ways to choose `k` positions for `1`s in the first half and `k` positions for `1`s in the second half can be calculated using binomial coefficients.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_binary_seq(n):\n       total_count = 0\n       for k from 0 to n:\n           # Calculate the number of ways to choose k 1's in the first half\n           ways_first_half = binomial_coefficient(n, k)\n           # Calculate the number of ways to choose k 1's in the second half\n           ways_second_half = binomial_coefficient(n, k)\n           # Total ways for this k\n           total_count += ways_first_half * ways_second_half\n       return total_count\n       \n   function binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n       if k > n:\n           return 0\n       if k == 0 or k == n:\n           return 1\n       return binomial_coefficient(n-1, k-1) + binomial_coefficient(n-1, k)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n    if k > n:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    return binomial_coefficient(n-1, k-1) + binomial_coefficient(n-1, k)\n\ndef count_binary_seq(n):\n    total_count = 0\n    for k in range(n + 1):\n        # Calculate the number of ways to choose k 1's in the first half\n        ways_first_half = binomial_coefficient(n, k)\n        # Calculate the number of ways to choose k 1's in the second half\n        ways_second_half = binomial_coefficient(n, k)\n        # Total ways for this k\n        total_count += ways_first_half * ways_second_half\n    return total_count\n```",
