INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/99 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a decimal (base 10) number as input and converts it into its binary (base 2) representation. The output should be a string that represents the binary number without any leading zeros.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert a decimal number to binary, we can repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary representation is formed by reading these remainders in reverse order. We also need to ensure that if the input is zero, we return '0' as the binary representation.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function decimal_to_binary(n):
       if n is 0:
           return '0'
       initialize an empty list to store remainders
       while n is greater than 0:
           remainder = n % 2
           append remainder to the list
           n = n // 2
       reverse the list of remainders
       convert the list to a string and return it
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:
    # Check if the input number is zero
    if n == 0:
        return '0'
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the binary digits
    binary_digits = []
    
    # Loop until the number is greater than zero
    while n > 0:
        # Get the remainder when n is divided by 2
        remainder = n % 2
        # Append the remainder to the list
        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))
        # Update n to be the quotient of n divided by 2
        n = n // 2
    
    # Reverse the list of binary digits to get the correct order
    binary_digits.reverse()
    
    # Join the list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(binary_digits)

    # Bit manipulation

    ## Binary number

    A **binary number** is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, it is a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).

    We say that a certain bit is **set**, if it is one, and **cleared** if it is zero.

    The binary number $(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2$ represents the number:

    $$(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2 = a_k \cdot 2^k + a_{k-1} \cdot 2^{k-1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot 2^1 + a_0 \cdot 2^0.$$

    For instance the binary number $1101_2$ represents the number $13$:

    $$\begin{align}
    1101_2 &= 1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 \\
           &= 1\cdot 8 + 1 \cdot 4 + 0 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 = 13
    \end{align}$$

    Computers represent integers as binary numbers.
    Positive integers (both signed and unsigned) are just represented with their binary digits, and negative signed numbers (which can be positive and negative) are usually represented with the [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).

    ```cpp
    unsigned int unsigned_number = 13;
    assert(unsigned_number == 0b1101);

    int positive_signed_number = 13;
    assert(positive_signed_number == 0b1101);

    int negative_signed_number = -13;
    assert(negative_signed_number == 0b1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'0011);
    ```

    CPUs are very fast manipulating those bits with specific operations.
    For some problems we can take these binary number representations to our advantage, and speed up the execution time.
    And for some problems (typically in combinatorics or dynamic programming) where we want to track which objects we already picked from a given set of objects, we can just use an large enough integer where each digit represents an object and depending on if we pick or drop the object we set or clear the digit.

    ## Bit operators

    All those introduced operators are instant (same speed as an addition) on a CPU for fixed-length integers.

    ### Bitwise operators

    -   $\&$ : The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand. 
        If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.
 	
    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.

    Examples:

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 01010000
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n | (n-1) = 01011111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    --------------------
    ~n        = 10100111
    ```

    ### Shift operators

    There are two operators for shifting bits.

    -   $\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.
        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \gg 2 = 101_2 \gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\frac{5}{2^2} = \frac{5}{4} = 1$.
        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.

    -   $\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.
        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \ll 3 = 101_2 \ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \cdot 2^3 = 5 \cdot 8 = 40$.

        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.


    ## Useful tricks

    ### Set/flip/clear a bit

    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.
    $1 \ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\sim(1 \ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.

    - $n ~|~ (1 \ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\wedge~ (1 \ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\&~ \sim(1 \ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$

    ### Check if a bit is set

    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.

    ``` cpp
    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {
        return (number >> x) & 1;
    }
    ```

    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2

    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).
    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.
    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.

    ``` cpp
    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {
        return n && !(n & (n - 1));
    }
    ```

    ### Clear the most-right set bit

    The expression $n ~\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.
    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.
    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.

    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:

    ```
    n         = 00110100
    n-1       = 00110011
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 00110000
    ```

    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm

    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.

    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.

    ``` cpp
    int countSetBits(int n)
    {
        int count = 0;
        while (n)
        {
            n = n & (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    Title: Balanced Ternary
    Part: 1/1
    # Balanced Ternary

    !["Setun computer using Balanced Ternary system"](https://earltcampbell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/setun.jpeg?w=300)

    This is a non-standard but still positional **numeral system**. Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.
    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,
    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the
    computers utilizing it.

    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:

    ```nohighlight
        0    0
        1    1
        2    1Z
        3    10
        4    11
        5    1ZZ
        6    1Z0
        7    1Z1
        8    10Z
        9    100
    ```

    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.

    ```nohighlight
        -1   Z
        -2   Z1
        -3   Z0
        -4   ZZ
        -5   Z11
    ```

    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.

    ## Conversion algorithm

    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is
    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,
    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -
    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.

    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.

    The final result is `1Z101`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \cdot 1 + 27 \cdot (-1) + 9 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$

    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.

    The final result is `100Z10`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \cdot 1 + 81 \cdot 0 + 27 \cdot 0 + 9 \cdot (-1) + 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$

    Title: Gray code
    Part: 1/1
    # Gray code

    Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit. 

    For example, the sequence of Gray codes for 3-bit numbers is: 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100, so $G(4) = 6$.

    This code was invented by Frank Gray in 1953.

    ## Finding Gray code

    Let's look at the bits of number $n$ and the bits of number $G(n)$. Notice that $i$-th bit of $G(n)$ equals 1 only when $i$-th bit of $n$ equals 1 and $i + 1$-th bit equals 0 or the other way around ($i$-th bit equals 0 and $i + 1$-th bit equals 1). Thus, $G(n) = n \oplus (n >> 1)$:  

    ```cpp
    int g (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }
    ```

    ## Finding inverse Gray code

    Given Gray code $g$, restore the original number $n$.

    We will move from the most significant bits to the least significant ones (the least significant bit has index 1 and the most significant bit has index $k$). The relation between the bits $n_i$ of number $n$ and the bits $g_i$ of number $g$:

    $$\begin{align}
      n_k &= g_k, \\
      n_{k-1} &= g_{k-1} \oplus n_k = g_k \oplus g_{k-1}, \\
      n_{k-2} &= g_{k-2} \oplus n_{k-1} = g_k \oplus g_{k-1} \oplus g_{k-2}, \\
      n_{k-3} &= g_{k-3} \oplus n_{k-2} = g_k \oplus g_{k-1} \oplus g_{k-2} \oplus g_{k-3},
      \vdots
    \end{align}$$

    The easiest way to write it in code is:

    ```cpp
    int rev_g (int g) {
      int n = 0;
      for (; g; g >>= 1)
        n ^= g;
      return n;
    }
    ```

    ## Practical applications
    Gray codes have some useful applications, sometimes quite unexpected:

    *   Gray code of $n$ bits forms a Hamiltonian cycle on a hypercube, where each bit corresponds to one dimension. 

    *   Gray codes are used to minimize the errors in digital-to-analog signals conversion (for example, in sensors). 

    *   Gray code can be used to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem.
        Let $n$ denote number of disks. Start with Gray code of length $n$ which
        consists of all zeroes ($G(0)$) and move between consecutive Gray codes (from $G(i)$ to $G(i+1)$).
        Let $i$-th bit of current Gray code represent $n$-th disk 
        (the least significant bit corresponds to the smallest disk and the most significant bit to the biggest disk). 
        Since exactly one bit changes on each step, we can treat changing $i$-th bit as moving $i$-th disk.
        Notice that there is exactly one move option for each disk (except the smallest one) on each step (except start and finish positions).
        There are always two move options for the smallest disk but there is a strategy which will always lead to answer:
        if $n$ is odd then sequence of the smallest disk moves looks like $f \to t \to r \to f \to t \to r \to ...$
        where $f$ is the initial rod, $t$ is the terminal rod and $r$ is the remaining rod), and 
        if $n$ is even: $f \to r \to t \to f \to r \to t \to ...$.

    *   Gray codes are also used in genetic algorithms theory.

INFO - raw_msg:
 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a decimal number as input and converts it into its binary representation as a string. The output string should not have any leading zeros.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To convert a decimal number to binary, we can repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary representation is formed by the remainders collected in reverse order. We need to ensure that the output string does not have leading zeros, which can be handled by starting the conversion from the highest significant bit.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function decimal_to_binary(n):
       if n is 0:
           return "0"
       binary_string = ""
       while n > 0:
           remainder = n % 2
           binary_string = str(remainder) + binary_string
           n = n // 2
       return binary_string
   ```

        binary_string = str(remainder) + binary_string
        # Update n to be the quotient of n divided by 2
        n = n // 2
    
    # Return the final binary string
