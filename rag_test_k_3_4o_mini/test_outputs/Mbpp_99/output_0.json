    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a decimal number as input and converts it into its binary representation as a string. The output string should not have any leading zeros.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To convert a decimal number to binary, we can repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. The binary representation is formed by the remainders collected in reverse order. We need to ensure that the output string does not have leading zeros, which can be handled by starting the conversion from the highest significant bit.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function decimal_to_binary(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return \"0\"\n       binary_string = \"\"\n       while n > 0:\n           remainder = n % 2\n           binary_string = str(remainder) + binary_string\n           n = n // 2\n       return binary_string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    # Check if the input number is zero\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to store the binary representation\n    binary_string = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop until the number becomes zero\n    while n > 0:\n        # Get the remainder when n is divided by 2 (this gives the current binary digit)\n        remainder = n % 2\n        # Prepend the remainder to the binary string\n        binary_string = str(remainder) + binary_string\n        # Update n to be the quotient of n divided by 2\n        n = n // 2\n    \n    # Return the final binary string\n    return binary_string\n```",
