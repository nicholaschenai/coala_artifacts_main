    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the product of all unique numbers in a given list. If a number appears multiple times in the list, it should only be counted once in the product calculation.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - First, we need to identify the unique numbers in the list. This can be done by converting the list to a set, which automatically removes duplicates.\n   - Next, we will initialize a variable to hold the product, starting at 1 (since multiplying by 1 does not change the product).\n   - We will then iterate through the unique numbers, multiplying them together to get the final product.\n   - Finally, we will return the computed product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function unique_product(numbers):\n       unique_numbers = set(numbers)  // Get unique numbers\n       product = 1                     // Initialize product\n       for number in unique_numbers:   // Iterate through unique numbers\n           product *= number           // Multiply to product\n       return product                  // Return the final product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef unique_product(numbers):\n    # Get unique numbers by converting the list to a set\n    unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n    \n    # Initialize the product variable to 1\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Iterate through each unique number\n    for number in unique_numbers:\n        # Multiply the current number to the product\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Return the final product of unique numbers\n    return product\n```",
