INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/69 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given list (sublist) is present within another list (main list). The function should return `True` if the sublist is found in the main list and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the sublist exists in the main list, we can iterate through the main list and check for segments of it that match the sublist. We will compare slices of the main list with the sublist. If we find a match, we return `True`. If we finish checking all possible segments without finding a match, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function is_sublist(main_list, sub_list):
       if sub_list is empty:
           return True
       if main_list is empty:

    Part: 1/1
    \section{Meet in the middle}

    \index{meet in the middle}

    \key{Meet in the middle} is a technique
    where the search space is divided into
    two parts of about equal size.
    A separate search is performed
    for both of the parts,
    and finally the results of the searches are combined.

    The technique can be used
    if there is an efficient way to combine the
    results of the searches.
    In such a situation, the two searches may require less
    time than one large search.
    Typically, we can turn a factor of $2^n$
    into a factor of $2^{n/2}$ using the meet in the
    middle technique.

    As an example, consider a problem where
    we are given a list of $n$ numbers and
    a number $x$,
    and we want to find out if it is possible
    to choose some numbers from the list so that
    their sum is $x$.
    For example, given the list $[2,4,5,9]$ and $x=15$,
    we can choose the numbers $[2,4,9]$ to get $2+4+9=15$.
    However, if $x=10$ for the same list,
    it is not possible to form the sum.

    A simple algorithm to the problem is to
    go through all subsets of the elements and
    check if the sum of any of the subsets is $x$.
    The running time of such an algorithm is $O(2^n)$,
    because there are $2^n$ subsets.
    However, using the meet in the middle technique,
    we can achieve a more efficient $O(2^{n/2})$ time algorithm\footnote{This
    idea was introduced in 1974 by E. Horowitz and S. Sahni \cite{hor74}.}.
    Note that $O(2^n)$ and $O(2^{n/2})$ are different
    complexities because $2^{n/2}$ equals $\sqrt{2^n}$.

    The idea is to divide the list into
    two lists $A$ and $B$ such that both
    lists contain about half of the numbers.
    The first search generates all subsets
    of $A$ and stores their sums to a list $S_A$.
    Correspondingly, the second search creates
    a list $S_B$ from $B$.
    After this, it suffices to check if it is possible
    to choose one element from $S_A$ and another
    element from $S_B$ such that their sum is $x$.
    This is possible exactly when there is a way to
    form the sum $x$ using the numbers of the original list.

    For example, suppose that the list is $[2,4,5,9]$ and $x=15$.
    First, we divide the list into $A=[2,4]$ and $B=[5,9]$.
    After this, we create lists
    $S_A=[0,2,4,6]$ and $S_B=[0,5,9,14]$.
    In this case, the sum $x=15$ is possible to form,
    because $S_A$ contains the sum $6$,
    $S_B$ contains the sum $9$, and $6+9=15$.
    This corresponds to the solution $[2,4,9]$.

    We can implement the algorithm so that
    its time complexity is $O(2^{n/2})$.
    First, we generate \emph{sorted} lists $S_A$ and $S_B$,
    which can be done in $O(2^{n/2})$ time using a merge-like technique.
    After this, since the lists are sorted,
    we can check in $O(2^{n/2})$ time if
    the sum $x$ can be created from $S_A$ and $S_B$.

    Title: Check if two segments intersect
    Part: 1/1
    # Check if two segments intersect

    You are given two segments $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$.
    You have to check if they intersect.
    Of course, you may find their intersection and check if it isn't empty, but this can't be done in integers for segments with integer coordinates.
    The approach described here can work in integers.

    ## Algorithm

    Firstly, consider the case when the segments are part of the same line.
    In this case it is sufficient to check if their projections on $Ox$ and $Oy$ intersect.
    In the other case $a$ and $b$ must not lie on the same side of line $(c, d)$, and $c$ and $d$ must not lie on the same side of line $(a, b)$.
    It can be checked with a couple of cross products.

    ## Implementation

    The given algorithm is implemented for integer points. Of course, it can be easily modified to work with doubles.

    ```{.cpp file=check-segments-inter}
    struct pt {
        long long x, y;
        pt() {}
        pt(long long _x, long long _y) : x(_x), y(_y) {}
        pt operator-(const pt& p) const { return pt(x - p.x, y - p.y); }
        long long cross(const pt& p) const { return x * p.y - y * p.x; }
        long long cross(const pt& a, const pt& b) const { return (a - *this).cross(b - *this); }
    };

    int sgn(const long long& x) { return x >= 0 ? x ? 1 : 0 : -1; }

    bool inter1(long long a, long long b, long long c, long long d) {
        if (a > b)
            swap(a, b);
        if (c > d)
            swap(c, d);
        return max(a, c) <= min(b, d);
    }

    bool check_inter(const pt& a, const pt& b, const pt& c, const pt& d) {
        if (c.cross(a, d) == 0 && c.cross(b, d) == 0)
            return inter1(a.x, b.x, c.x, d.x) && inter1(a.y, b.y, c.y, d.y);
        return sgn(a.cross(b, c)) != sgn(a.cross(b, d)) &&
               sgn(c.cross(d, a)) != sgn(c.cross(d, b));
    }

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 1/2
    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum

    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).

    ## Problem statement

    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:

    $$ \max_{ 1 \le l \le r \le n } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.
    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.

    ## Algorithm 1

    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm is very simple.

    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.

    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.

    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.

    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.

    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.

    ### Implementation

    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ — we will only need the current element from it.

    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.

    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);
        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);
    }
    ```

    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        int cur = sum - min_sum;
        if (cur > ans) {
            ans = cur;
            ans_l = min_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = sum;
            min_pos = r;
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Algorithm 2

    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.

    **Proof:**

    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum — so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.

    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.

    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a "critical" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.

    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.

    ### Implementation

    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum);
        sum = max(sum, 0);
    }
    ```

    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        if (sum > ans) {
            ans = sum;
            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < 0) {
            sum = 0;
            minus_pos = r;
        }
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/69 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that checks if a given list contains a specific sublist. The function should return `True` if the sublist is found within the list, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To determine if a sublist exists within a list, we can iterate through the main list and check for matches with the sublist. We will compare slices of the main list with the sublist. If we find a match, we return `True`. If we finish checking all possible starting points without finding a match, we return `False`.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   - Define a function `is_sublist(main_list, sub_list)`.
   - Get the lengths of both lists.
   - If the length of the sublist is greater than the main list, return `False`.
   - Loop through the main list from index `0` to `len(main_list) - len(sub_list)`.
     - For each index, check if the slice of the main list from that index to the length of the sublist matches the sublist.
