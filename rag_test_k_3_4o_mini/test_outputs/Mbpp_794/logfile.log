    Title: Balanced bracket sequences
    Part: 1/2
    # Balanced bracket sequences

    A **balanced bracket sequence** is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence, when inserted certain numbers and mathematical operations, gives a valid mathematical expression.
    Formally you can define balanced bracket sequence with:

    - $e$ (the empty string) is a balanced bracket sequence.
    - if $s$ is a balanced bracket sequence, then so is $(s)$.
    - if $s$ and $t$ are balanced bracket sequences, then so is $s t$.

    For instance $(())()$ is a balanced bracket sequence, but $())($ is not.

    Of course you can define other bracket sequences also with multiple bracket types in a similar fashion.

    In this article we discuss some classic problems involving balanced bracket sequences (for simplicity we will only call them sequences): validation, number of sequences, finding the lexicographical next sequence, generating all sequences of a certain size, finding the index of sequence, and generating the $k$-th sequences.
    We will also discuss two variations for the problems, the simpler version when only one type of brackets is allowed, and the harder case when there are multiple types.

    ## Balance validation

    We want to check if a given string is balanced or not.

    At first suppose there is only one type of bracket.
    For this case there exists a very simple algorithm.
    Let $\text{depth}$ be the current number of open brackets.
    Initially $\text{depth} = 0$.
    We iterate over all character of the string, if the current bracket character is an opening bracket, then we increment $\text{depth}$, otherwise we decrement it.
    If at any time the variable $\text{depth}$ gets negative, or at the end it is different from $0$, then the string is not a balanced sequence.
    Otherwise it is.

    If there are several bracket types involved, then the algorithm needs to be changes.
    Instead of a counter $\text{depth}$ we create a stack, in which we will store all opening brackets that we meet.
    If the current bracket character is an opening one, we put it onto the stack.
    If it is a closing one, then we check if the stack is non-empty, and if the top element of the stack is of the same type as the current closing bracket.
    If both conditions are fulfilled, then we remove the opening bracket from the stack.
    If at any time one of the conditions is not fulfilled, or at the end the stack is not empty, then the string is not balanced.
    Otherwise it is.

    ## Number of balanced sequences

    ### Formula

    The number of balanced bracket sequences with only one bracket type can be calculated using the [Catalan numbers](catalan-numbers.md).
    The number of balanced bracket sequences of length $2n$ ($n$ pairs of brackets) is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$$

    If we allow $k$ types of brackets, then each pair be of any of the $k$ types (independently of the others), thus the number of balanced bracket sequences is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} k^n$$

    ### Dynamic programming

    On the other hand these numbers can be computed using **dynamic programming**.
    Let $d[n]$ be the number of regular bracket sequences with $n$ pairs of bracket.
    Note that in the first position there is always an opening bracket.
    And somewhere later is the corresponding closing bracket of the pair.
    It is clear that inside this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence, and similarly after this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence.
    So to compute $d[n]$, we will look at how many balanced sequences of $i$ pairs of brackets are inside this first bracket pair, and how many balanced sequences with $n-1-i$ pairs are after this pair.
    Consequently the formula has the form:

    $$d[n] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d[i] \cdot d[n-1-i]$$

    The initial value for this recurrence is $d[0] = 1$.

    ## Finding the lexicographical next balanced sequence

    Here we only consider the case with one valid bracket type.

    Given a balanced sequence, we have to find the next (in lexicographical order) balanced sequence.

    It should be obvious, that we have to find the rightmost opening bracket, which we can replace by a closing bracket without violation the condition, that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets up to this position.
    After replacing this position, we can fill the remaining part of the string with the lexicographically minimal one: i.e. first with as much opening brackets as possible, and then fill up the remaining positions with closing brackets.
    In other words we try to leave a long as possible prefix unchanged, and the suffix gets replaced by the lexicographically minimal one.

    To find this position, we can iterate over the character from right to left, and maintain the balance $\text{depth}$ of open and closing brackets.
    When we meet an opening brackets, we will decrement $\text{depth}$, and when we meet a closing bracket, we increase it.
    If we are at some point meet an opening bracket, and the balance after processing this symbol is positive, then we have found the rightmost position that we can change.
    We change the symbol, compute the number of opening and closing brackets that we have to add to the right side, and arrange them in the lexicographically minimal way.

    If we find do suitable position, then this sequence is already the maximal possible one, and there is no answer.

    ```{.cpp file=next_balanced_brackets_sequence}
    bool next_balanced_sequence(string & s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '(')
                depth--;
            else
                depth++;

            if (s[i] == '(' && depth > 0) {
                depth--;
                int open = (n - i - 1 - depth) / 2;
                int close = n - i - 1 - open;
                string next = s.substr(0, i) + ')' + string(open, '(') + string(close, ')');
                s.swap(next);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    \chapter{String algorithms}

    This chapter deals with efficient algorithms
    for string processing.
    Many string problems can be easily solved
    in $O(n^2)$ time, but the challenge is to
    find algorithms that work in $O(n)$ or $O(n \log n)$
    time.

    \index{pattern matching}

    For example, a fundamental string processing
    problem is the \key{pattern matching} problem:
    given a string of length $n$ and a pattern of length $m$,
    our task is to find the occurrences of the pattern
    in the string.
    For example, the pattern \texttt{ABC} occurs two
    times in the string \texttt{ABABCBABC}.

    The pattern matching problem can be easily solved
    in $O(nm)$ time by a brute force algorithm that
    tests all positions where the pattern may
    occur in the string.
    However, in this chapter, we will see that there
    are more efficient algorithms that require only
    $O(n+m)$ time.

    \index{string}

    \section{String terminology}

    \index{alphabet}

    Throughout the chapter, we assume that
    zero-based indexing is used in strings.
    Thus, a string \texttt{s} of length $n$
    consists of characters
    $\texttt{s}[0],\texttt{s}[1],\ldots,\texttt{s}[n-1]$.
    The set of characters that may appear
    in strings is called an \key{alphabet}.
    For example, the alphabet
    $\{\texttt{A},\texttt{B},\ldots,\texttt{Z}\}$
    consists of the capital letters of English.

    \index{substring}

    A \key{substring} is a sequence of consecutive
    characters in a string.
    We use the notation $\texttt{s}[a \ldots b]$
    to refer to a substring of \texttt{s}
    that begins at position $a$ and ends at position $b$.
    A string of length $n$ has $n(n+1)/2$ substrings.
    For example, the substrings of
    \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}, \texttt{D},
    \texttt{AB}, \texttt{BC}, \texttt{CD},
    \texttt{ABC}, \texttt{BCD} and \texttt{ABCD}.

    \index{subsequence}

    A \key{subsequence} is a sequence of
    (not necessarily consecutive) characters
    in a string in their original order.
    A string of length $n$ has $2^n-1$ subsequences.
    For example, the subsequences of
    \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}, \texttt{D},
    \texttt{AB}, \texttt{AC}, \texttt{AD},
    \texttt{BC}, \texttt{BD}, \texttt{CD},
    \texttt{ABC}, \texttt{ABD}, \texttt{ACD},
    \texttt{BCD} and \texttt{ABCD}.

    \index{prefix}
    \index{suffix}

    A \key{prefix} is a substring that starts at the beginning
    of a string,
    and a \key{suffix} is a substring that ends at the end
    of a string.
    For example,
    the prefixes of \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{A}, \texttt{AB}, \texttt{ABC} and \texttt{ABCD},
    and the suffixes of \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{D}, \texttt{CD}, \texttt{BCD} and \texttt{ABCD}.

    \index{rotation}

    A \key{rotation} can be generated by moving
    the characters of a string one by one from the beginning
    to the end (or vice versa).
    For example, the rotations of \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{ABCD}, \texttt{BCDA}, \texttt{CDAB} and \texttt{DABC}.

    \index{period}

    A \key{period} is a prefix of a string such that
    the string can be constructed by repeating the period.
    The last repetition may be partial and contain
    only a prefix of the period.
    For example, the shortest period of
    \texttt{ABCABCA} is \texttt{ABC}.

    \index{border}

    A \key{border} is a string that is both
    a prefix and a suffix of a string.
    For example, the borders of \texttt{ABACABA}
    are \texttt{A}, \texttt{ABA} and \texttt{ABACABA}.

    \index{lexicographical order}

    Strings are compared using the \key{lexicographical order}
    (which corresponds to the alphabetical order).
    It means that $x<y$ if either $x \neq y$ and $x$ is a prefix of $y$,
    or there is a position $k$ such that
    $x[i]=y[i]$ when $i<k$ and $x[k]<y[k]$.

   We need to create a function that checks if a given string starts with the letter 'a', followed by any characters, and ends with the letter 'b'.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: 
   To solve this problem, we can check the first character of the string to see if it is 'a' and the last character to see if it is 'b'. If both conditions are satisfied, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function text_starta_endb(s: str) -> bool:
       if s is empty:
           return False
       if s[0] is 'a' and s[-1] is 'b':
           return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def text_starta_endb(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the string is empty
    if not s:
        return False
    # Check if the first character is 'a' and the last character is 'b'
    if s[0] == 'a' and s[-1] == 'b':
        return True
    return False
```
