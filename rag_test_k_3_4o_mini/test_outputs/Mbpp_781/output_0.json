    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if the number of divisors of a given integer is even. If the count of divisors is even, the function should return `True`, otherwise it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To determine if the count of divisors of a number `n` is even, we can iterate through all integers from `1` to `n` and count how many of them divide `n` without leaving a remainder. After counting the divisors, we check if this count is even or odd.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_divisors(n):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           if n is divisible by i:\n               increment count\n       return count is even\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Initialize a counter for the number of divisors\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            count += 1  # Increment the count if it is a divisor\n    \n    # Return True if the count of divisors is even, otherwise False\n    return count % 2 == 0\n```",
