However, this approach is not practical for large $a$ or $n$.\n\n    $a^{b+c} = a^b \\cdot a^c$ and $a^{2b} = a^b \\cdot a^b = (a^b)^2$.\n\n    The idea of binary exponentiation is, that we split the work using the binary representation of the exponent.\n\n    Let's write $n$ in base 2, for example:\n\n    $$3^{13} = 3^{1101_2} = 3^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 3^1$$\n\n    Since the number $n$ has exactly $\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor + 1$ digits in base 2, we only need to perform $O(\\log n)$ multiplications, if we know the powers $a^1, a^2, a^4, a^8, \\dots, a^{2^{\\lfloor \\log n \\rfloor}}$.\n\n    So we only need to know a fast way to compute those.\n    Luckily this is very easy, since an element in the sequence is just the square of the previous element.\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    3^1 &= 3 \\\\\n    3^2 &= \\left(3^1\\right)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\\\\n    3^4 &= \\left(3^2\\right)^2 = 9^2 = 81 \\\\\n    3^8 &= \\left(3^4\\right)^2 = 81^2 = 6561\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    So to get the final answer for $3^{13}$, we only need to multiply three of them (skipping $3^2$ because the corresponding bit in $n$ is not set):\n    $3^{13} = 6561 \\cdot 81 \\cdot 3 = 1594323$\n\n    The final complexity of this algorithm is $O(\\log n)$: we have to compute $\\log n$ powers of $a$, and then have to do at most $\\log n$ multiplications to get the final answer from them.\n\n    The following recursive approach expresses the same idea:\n\n    $$a^n = \\begin{cases}\n    1 &\\text{if } n == 0 \\\\\n    \\left(a^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\right)^2 &\\text{if } n > 0 \\text{ and } n \\text{ even}\\\\\n    \\left(a^{\\frac{n - 1}{2}}\\right)^2 \\cdot a &\\text{if } n > 0 \\text{ and } n \\text{ odd}\\\\\n    \\end{cases}$$\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    First the recursive approach, which is a direct translation of the recursive formula:\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {\n        if (b == 0)\n            return 1;\n        long long res = binpow(a, b / 2);\n        if (b % 2)\n            return res * res * a;\n        else\n            return res * res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The second approach accomplishes the same task without recursion.\n    It computes all the powers in a loop, and multiplies the ones with the corresponding set bit in $n$.\n    Although the complexity of both approaches is identical, this approach will be faster in practice since we don't have the overhead of the recursive calls.\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {\n        long long res = 1;\n        while (b > 0) {\n            if (b & 1)\n                res = res * a;\n            a = a * a;\n            b >>= 1;\n        }\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Applications\n\n    ### Effective computation of large exponents modulo a number\n\n    **Problem:**\n    Compute $x^n \\bmod m$.\n    This is a very common operation. For instance it is used in computing the [modular multiplicative inverse](module-inverse.md).\n\n    **Solution:**\n    Since we know that the modulo operator doesn't interfere with multiplications ($a \\cdot b \\equiv (a \\bmod m) \\cdot (b \\bmod m) \\pmod m$), we can directly use the same code, and just replace every multiplication with a modular multiplication:\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long binpow(long long a, long long b, long long m) {\n        a %= m;\n        long long res = 1;\n        while (b > 0) {\n            if (b & 1)\n                res = res * a % m;\n            a = a * a % m;\n            b >>= 1;\n        }\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Note:**\n    It's possible to speed this algorithm for large $b >> m$.\n    If $m$ is a prime number $x^n \\equiv x^{n \\bmod (m-1)} \\pmod{m}$ for prime $m$, and $x^n \\equiv x^{n \\bmod{\\phi(m)}} \\pmod{m}$ for composite $m$.\n    This follows directly from Fermat's little theorem and Euler's theorem, see the article about [Modular Inverses](module-inverse.md#fermat-euler) for more details.\n\n    ### Effective computation of Fibonacci numbers\n\n    **Problem:** Compute $n$-th Fibonacci number $F_n$.\n\n    **Solution:** For more details, see the [Fibonacci Number article](fibonacci-numbers.md).\n    We will only go through an overview of the algorithm.\n    To compute the next Fibonacci number, only the two previous ones are needed, as $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.\n    We can build a $2 \\times 2$ matrix that describes this transformation:\n    the transition from $F_i$ and $F_{i+1}$ to $F_{i+1}$ and $F_{i+2}$.\n    For example, applying this transformation to the pair $F_0$ and $F_1$ would change it into $F_1$ and $F_2$.\n    Therefore, we can raise this transformation matrix to the $n$-th power to find $F_n$ in time complexity $O(\\log n)$.\n\n    ### Applying a permutation $k$ times { data-toc-label='Applying a permutation <script type=\"math/tex\">k</script> times' }\n\n    **Problem:** You are given a sequence of length $n$. Apply to it a given permutation $k$ times.\n\n    **Solution:** Simply raise the permutation to $k$-th power using binary exponentiation, and then apply it to the sequence. This will give you a time complexity of $O(n \\log k)$.\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> applyPermutation(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation) {\n        vector<int> newSequence(sequence.size());\n        for(int i = 0; i < sequence.size(); i++) {\n            newSequence[i] = sequence[permutation[i]];\n        }\n        return newSequence;\n    }\n\n    vector<int> permute(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation, long long b) {\n        while (b > 0) {\n            if (b & 1) {\n                sequence = applyPermutation(sequence, permutation);\n            }\n            permutation = applyPermutation(permutation, permutation);\n            b >>= 1;\n        }\n        return sequence;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Continued fractions\n    Part: 8/12\n    ```\n\n        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\\frac{x+y \\sqrt{n}}{z}$.\n\n    !!! example \"[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)\"\n        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square.
