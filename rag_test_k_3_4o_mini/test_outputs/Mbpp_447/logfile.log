    Title: Binary Exponentiation
    Part: 1/2
    # Binary Exponentiation

    Binary exponentiation (also known as exponentiation by squaring) is a trick which allows to calculate $a^n$ using only $O(\log n)$ multiplications (instead of $O(n)$ multiplications required by the naive approach).

    It also has important applications in many tasks unrelated to arithmetic, since it
    can be used with any operations that have the property of **associativity**:

    $$(X \cdot Y) \cdot Z = X \cdot (Y \cdot Z)$$

    Most obviously this applies to modular multiplication, to multiplication of matrices and
    to other problems which we will discuss below.

    ## Algorithm

    Raising $a$ to the power of $n$ is expressed naively as multiplication by $a$ done $n - 1$ times:
    $a^{n} = a \cdot a \cdot \ldots \cdot a$. However, this approach is not practical for large $a$ or $n$.

    $a^{b+c} = a^b \cdot a^c$ and $a^{2b} = a^b \cdot a^b = (a^b)^2$.

    The idea of binary exponentiation is, that we split the work using the binary representation of the exponent.

    Let's write $n$ in base 2, for example:

    $$3^{13} = 3^{1101_2} = 3^8 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 3^1$$

    Since the number $n$ has exactly $\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor + 1$ digits in base 2, we only need to perform $O(\log n)$ multiplications, if we know the powers $a^1, a^2, a^4, a^8, \dots, a^{2^{\lfloor \log n \rfloor}}$.

    So we only need to know a fast way to compute those.
    Luckily this is very easy, since an element in the sequence is just the square of the previous element.

    $$\begin{align}
    3^1 &= 3 \\
    3^2 &= \left(3^1\right)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\
    3^4 &= \left(3^2\right)^2 = 9^2 = 81 \\
    3^8 &= \left(3^4\right)^2 = 81^2 = 6561
    \end{align}$$

    So to get the final answer for $3^{13}$, we only need to multiply three of them (skipping $3^2$ because the corresponding bit in $n$ is not set):
    $3^{13} = 6561 \cdot 81 \cdot 3 = 1594323$

    The final complexity of this algorithm is $O(\log n)$: we have to compute $\log n$ powers of $a$, and then have to do at most $\log n$ multiplications to get the final answer from them.

    The following recursive approach expresses the same idea:

    $$a^n = \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if } n == 0 \\
    \left(a^{\frac{n}{2}}\right)^2 &\text{if } n > 0 \text{ and } n \text{ even}\\
    \left(a^{\frac{n - 1}{2}}\right)^2 \cdot a &\text{if } n > 0 \text{ and } n \text{ odd}\\
    \end{cases}$$

    ## Implementation

    First the recursive approach, which is a direct translation of the recursive formula:

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
        if (b == 0)
            return 1;
        long long res = binpow(a, b / 2);
        if (b % 2)
            return res * res * a;
        else
            return res * res;
    }
    ```

    The second approach accomplishes the same task without recursion.
    It computes all the powers in a loop, and multiplies the ones with the corresponding set bit in $n$.
    Although the complexity of both approaches is identical, this approach will be faster in practice since we don't have the overhead of the recursive calls.

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
        long long res = 1;
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1)
                res = res * a;
            a = a * a;
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```

    ## Applications

    ### Effective computation of large exponents modulo a number

    **Problem:**
    Compute $x^n \bmod m$.
    This is a very common operation. For instance it is used in computing the [modular multiplicative inverse](module-inverse.md).

    **Solution:**
    Since we know that the modulo operator doesn't interfere with multiplications ($a \cdot b \equiv (a \bmod m) \cdot (b \bmod m) \pmod m$), we can directly use the same code, and just replace every multiplication with a modular multiplication:

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b, long long m) {
        a %= m;
        long long res = 1;
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1)
                res = res * a % m;
            a = a * a % m;
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```

    **Note:**
    It's possible to speed this algorithm for large $b >> m$.
    If $m$ is a prime number $x^n \equiv x^{n \bmod (m-1)} \pmod{m}$ for prime $m$, and $x^n \equiv x^{n \bmod{\phi(m)}} \pmod{m}$ for composite $m$.
    This follows directly from Fermat's little theorem and Euler's theorem, see the article about [Modular Inverses](module-inverse.md#fermat-euler) for more details.

    ### Effective computation of Fibonacci numbers

    **Problem:** Compute $n$-th Fibonacci number $F_n$.

    **Solution:** For more details, see the [Fibonacci Number article](fibonacci-numbers.md).
    We will only go through an overview of the algorithm.
    To compute the next Fibonacci number, only the two previous ones are needed, as $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
    We can build a $2 \times 2$ matrix that describes this transformation:
    the transition from $F_i$ and $F_{i+1}$ to $F_{i+1}$ and $F_{i+2}$.
    For example, applying this transformation to the pair $F_0$ and $F_1$ would change it into $F_1$ and $F_2$.
    Therefore, we can raise this transformation matrix to the $n$-th power to find $F_n$ in time complexity $O(\log n)$.

    ### Applying a permutation $k$ times { data-toc-label='Applying a permutation <script type="math/tex">k</script> times' }

    **Problem:** You are given a sequence of length $n$. Apply to it a given permutation $k$ times.

    **Solution:** Simply raise the permutation to $k$-th power using binary exponentiation, and then apply it to the sequence. This will give you a time complexity of $O(n \log k)$.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> applyPermutation(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation) {
        vector<int> newSequence(sequence.size());
        for(int i = 0; i < sequence.size(); i++) {
            newSequence[i] = sequence[permutation[i]];
        }
        return newSequence;
    }

    vector<int> permute(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation, long long b) {
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1) {
                sequence = applyPermutation(sequence, permutation);
            }
            permutation = applyPermutation(permutation, permutation);
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return sequence;
    }

        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\frac{x+y \sqrt{n}}{z}$.

    !!! example "[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)"
        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.
