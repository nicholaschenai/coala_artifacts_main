Calculation of the hash of a string\n\n    The good and widely used way to define the hash of a string $s$ of length $n$ is\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    \\text{hash}(s) &= s[0] + s[1] \\cdot p + s[2] \\cdot p^2 + ... + s[n-1] \\cdot p^{n-1} \\mod m \\\\\n    &= \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \\cdot p^i \\mod m,\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    where $p$ and $m$ are some chosen, positive numbers.\n    It is called a **polynomial rolling hash function**.\n\n    It is reasonable to make $p$ a prime number roughly equal to the number of characters in the input alphabet.\n    For example, if the input is composed of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, $p = 31$ is a good choice.\n    If the input may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, then $p = 53$ is a possible choice.\n    The code in this article will use $p = 31$.\n\n    Obviously $m$ should be a large number since the probability of two random strings colliding is about $\\approx \\frac{1}{m}$.\n    Sometimes $m = 2^{64}$ is chosen, since then the integer overflows of 64-bit integers work exactly like the modulo operation.\n    However, there exists a method, which generates colliding strings (which work independently from the choice of $p$).\n    So in practice, $m = 2^{64}$ is not recommended.\n    A good choice for $m$ is some large prime number.\n    The code in this article will just use $m = 10^9+9$.\n    This is a large number, but still small enough so that we can perform multiplication of two values using 64-bit integers.\n\n    Here is an example of calculating the hash of a string $s$, which contains only lowercase letters.\n    We convert each character of $s$ to an integer.\n    Here we use the conversion $a \\rightarrow 1$, $b \\rightarrow 2$, $\\dots$, $z \\rightarrow 26$.\n    Converting $a \\rightarrow 0$ is not a good idea, because then the hashes of the strings $a$, $aa$, $aaa$, $\\dots$ all evaluate to $0$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=hashing_function}\n    long long compute_hash(string const& s) {\n        const int p = 31;\n        const int m = 1e9 + 9;\n        long long hash_value = 0;\n        long long p_pow = 1;\n        for (char c : s) {\n            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;\n            p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;\n        }\n        return hash_value;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Precomputing the powers of $p$ might give a performance boost.\n\n    ## Example tasks\n\n    ### Search for duplicate strings in an array of strings\n\n    Problem: Given a list of $n$ strings $s_i$, each no longer than $m$ characters, find all the duplicate strings and divide them into groups.\n\n    From the obvious algorithm involving sorting the strings, we would get a time complexity of $O(n m \\log n)$ where the sorting requires $O(n \\log n)$ comparisons and each comparison take $O(m)$ time.\n    However, by using hashes, we reduce the comparison time to $O(1)$, giving us an algorithm that runs in $O(n m + n \\log n)$ time.\n\n    We calculate the hash for each string, sort the hashes together with the indices, and then group the indices by identical hashes.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=hashing_group_identical_strings}\n    vector<vector<int>> group_identical_strings(vector<string> const& s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<pair<long long, int>> hashes(n);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n            hashes[i] = {compute_hash(s[i]), i};\n\n        sort(hashes.begin(), hashes.end());\n\n        vector<vector<int>> groups;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            if (i == 0 || hashes[i].first != hashes[i-1].first)\n                groups.emplace_back();\n            groups.back().push_back(hashes[i].second);\n        }\n        return groups;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Balanced Ternary\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Balanced Ternary\n\n    ![\"Setun computer using Balanced Ternary system\"](https://earltcampbell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/setun.jpeg?w=300)\n\n    This is a non-standard but still positional **numeral system**. Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.\n    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,\n    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the\n    computers utilizing it.\n\n    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:\n\n    ```nohighlight\n        0    0\n        1    1\n        2    1Z\n        3    10\n        4    11\n        5    1ZZ\n        6    1Z0\n        7    1Z1\n        8    10Z\n        9    100\n    ```\n\n    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.\n\n    ```nohighlight\n        -1   Z\n        -2   Z1\n        -3   Z0\n        -4   ZZ\n        -5   Z11\n    ```\n\n    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.\n\n    ## Conversion algorithm\n\n    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is\n    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,\n    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -\n    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.\n\n    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n\n    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$\n\n    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:\n\n    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.\n\n    The final result is `1Z101`.\n\n    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n\n    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \\cdot 1 + 27 \\cdot (-1) + 9 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$\n\n    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n\n    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$\n\n    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:\n\n    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.\n    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.\n    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.\n\n    The final result is `100Z10`.\n\n    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n\n    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \\cdot 1 + 81 \\cdot 0 + 27 \\cdot 0 + 9 \\cdot (-1) + 3 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
