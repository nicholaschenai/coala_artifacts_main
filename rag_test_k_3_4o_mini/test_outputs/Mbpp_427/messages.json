Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.\n    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,\n    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the\n    computers utilizing it.\n\n    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:\n\n    ```nohighlight\n        0    0\n        1    1\n        2    1Z\n        3    10\n        4    11\n        5    1ZZ\n        6    1Z0\n        7    1Z1\n        8    10Z\n        9    100\n    ```\n\n    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.\n\n    ```nohighlight\n        -1   Z\n        -2   Z1\n        -3   Z0\n        -4   ZZ\n        -5   Z11\n    ```\n\n    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.\n\n    ## Conversion algorithm\n\n    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is\n    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,\n    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -\n    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.\n\n    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n\n    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$\n\n    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:\n\n    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.\n\n    The final result is `1Z101`.\n\n    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n\n    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \\cdot 1 + 27 \\cdot (-1) + 9 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$\n\n    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n\n    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$\n\n    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:\n\n    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.\n    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.\n    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.\n\n    The final result is `100Z10`.\n\n    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n\n    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \\cdot 1 + 81 \\cdot 0 + 27 \\cdot 0 + 9 \\cdot (-1) + 3 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Introduction\n    Section: Programming languages\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\chapter{Introduction}\n\n    Competitive programming combines two topics:\n    (1) the design of algorithms and (2) the implementation of algorithms.\n\n    The \\key{design of algorithms} consists of problem solving\n    and mathematical thinking.\n    Skills for analyzing problems and solving them\n    creatively are needed.\n    An algorithm for solving a problem\n    has to be both correct and efficient,\n    and the core of the problem is often\n    about inventing an efficient algorithm.\n\n    Theoretical knowledge of algorithms\n    is important to competitive programmers.\n    Typically, a solution to a problem is\n    a combination of well-known techniques and\n    new insights.\n    The techniques that appear in competitive programming\n    also form the basis for the scientific research\n    of algorithms.\n\n    The \\key{implementation of algorithms} requires good\n    programming skills.\n    In competitive programming, the solutions\n    are graded by testing an implemented algorithm\n    using a set of test cases.\n    Thus, it is not enough that the idea of the\n    algorithm is correct, but the implementation also\n    has to be correct.\n\n    A good coding style in contests is\n    straightforward and concise.\n    Programs should be written quickly,\n    because there is not much time available.\n    Unlike in traditional software engineering,\n    the programs are short (usually at most a few\n    hundred lines of code), and they do not need to \n    be maintained after the contest.\n\n    \\section{Programming languages}\n\n    \\index{programming language}\n\n    At the moment, the most popular programming\n    languages used in contests are C++, Python and Java.\n    For example, in Google Code Jam 2017,\n    among the best 3,000 participants,\n    79 \\% used C++,\n    16 \\% used Python and\n    8 \\% used Java \\cite{goo17}.\n    Some participants also used several languages.\n\n    Many people think that C++ is the best choice\n    for a competitive programmer,\n    and C++ is nearly always available in\n    contest systems.\n    The benefits of using C++ are that\n    it is a very efficient language and\n    its standard library contains a \n    large collection\n    of data structures and algorithms.\n\n    On the other hand, it is good to\n    master several languages and understand\n    their strengths.\n    For example, if large integers are needed\n    in the problem,\n    Python can be a good choice, because it\n    contains built-in operations for\n    calculating with large integers.\n    Still, most problems in programming contests\n    are set so that\n    using a specific programming language\n    is not an unfair advantage.\n\n    All example programs in this book are written in C++,\n    and the standard library's\n    data structures and algorithms are often used.\n    The programs follow the C++11 standard,\n    which can be used in most contests nowadays.\n    If you cannot program in C++ yet,\n    now is a good time to start learning.\n\n    \\subsubsection{C++ code template}\n\n    A typical C++ code template for competitive programming\n    looks like this:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\n    using namespace std;\n\n    int main() {\n        // solution comes here\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The \\texttt{\\#include} line at the beginning\n    of the code is a feature of the \\texttt{g++} compiler\n    that allows us to include the entire standard library.\n    Thus, it is not needed to separately include\n    libraries such as \\texttt{iostream},\n    \\texttt{vector} and \\texttt{algorithm},\n    but rather they are available automatically.\n\n    The \\texttt{using} line declares\n    that the classes and functions\n    of the standard library can be used directly\n    in the code.\n    Without the \\texttt{using} line we would have\n    to write, for example, \\texttt{std::cout},\n    but now it suffices to write \\texttt{cout}.\n\n    The code can be compiled using the following command:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall test.cpp -o test\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    This command produces a binary file \\texttt{test}\n    from the source code \\texttt{test.cpp}.\n    The compiler follows the C++11 standard\n    (\\texttt{-std=c++11}),\n    optimizes the code (\\texttt{-O2})\n    and shows warnings about possible errors (\\texttt{-Wall}).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
