INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/427 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a date in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" and converts it to the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert the date format, we can split the input string by the hyphen ("-") to separate the year, month, and day. After splitting, we can rearrange these components to form the new date format and then join them back together with hyphens.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `change_date_format` that takes a string input `date_str`.
   - Split `date_str` using the hyphen to get a list of components (year, month, day).
   - Rearrange the components to form a new list in the order of day, month, year.
   - Join the new list into a string with hyphens.
   - Return the newly formatted date string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def change_date_format(date_str: str) -> str:
    # Split the input date string by the hyphen
    components = date_str.split('-')
    
    # Rearrange the components to the new format (day-month-year)
    new_format = [components[2], components[1], components[0]]
    
    # Join the new format components with hyphens
    formatted_date = '-'.join(new_format)
    
    # Return the newly formatted date string
    return formatted_date

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    # Balanced Ternary

    !["Setun computer using Balanced Ternary system"](https://earltcampbell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/setun.jpeg?w=300)

    This is a non-standard but still positional **numeral system**. Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.
    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,
    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the
    computers utilizing it.

    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:

    ```nohighlight
        0    0
        1    1
        2    1Z
        3    10
        4    11
        5    1ZZ
        6    1Z0
        7    1Z1
        8    10Z
        9    100
    ```

    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.

    ```nohighlight
        -1   Z
        -2   Z1
        -3   Z0
        -4   ZZ
        -5   Z11
    ```

    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.

    ## Conversion algorithm

    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is
    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,
    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -
    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.

    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.

    The final result is `1Z101`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \cdot 1 + 27 \cdot (-1) + 9 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$

    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.

    The final result is `100Z10`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \cdot 1 + 81 \cdot 0 + 27 \cdot 0 + 9 \cdot (-1) + 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$

    Chapter: Introduction
    Section: Programming languages
    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{Introduction}

    Competitive programming combines two topics:
    (1) the design of algorithms and (2) the implementation of algorithms.

    The \key{design of algorithms} consists of problem solving
    and mathematical thinking.
    Skills for analyzing problems and solving them
    creatively are needed.
    An algorithm for solving a problem
    has to be both correct and efficient,
    and the core of the problem is often
    about inventing an efficient algorithm.

    Theoretical knowledge of algorithms
    is important to competitive programmers.
    Typically, a solution to a problem is
    a combination of well-known techniques and
    new insights.
    The techniques that appear in competitive programming
    also form the basis for the scientific research
    of algorithms.

    The \key{implementation of algorithms} requires good
    programming skills.
    In competitive programming, the solutions
    are graded by testing an implemented algorithm
    using a set of test cases.
    Thus, it is not enough that the idea of the
    algorithm is correct, but the implementation also
    has to be correct.

    A good coding style in contests is
    straightforward and concise.
    Programs should be written quickly,
    because there is not much time available.
    Unlike in traditional software engineering,
    the programs are short (usually at most a few
    hundred lines of code), and they do not need to 
    be maintained after the contest.

    \section{Programming languages}

    \index{programming language}

    At the moment, the most popular programming
    languages used in contests are C++, Python and Java.
    For example, in Google Code Jam 2017,
    among the best 3,000 participants,
    79 \% used C++,
    16 \% used Python and
    8 \% used Java \cite{goo17}.
    Some participants also used several languages.

    Many people think that C++ is the best choice
    for a competitive programmer,
    and C++ is nearly always available in
    contest systems.
    The benefits of using C++ are that
    it is a very efficient language and
    its standard library contains a 
    large collection
    of data structures and algorithms.

    On the other hand, it is good to
    master several languages and understand
    their strengths.
    For example, if large integers are needed
    in the problem,
    Python can be a good choice, because it
    contains built-in operations for
    calculating with large integers.
    Still, most problems in programming contests
    are set so that
    using a specific programming language
    is not an unfair advantage.

    All example programs in this book are written in C++,
    and the standard library's
    data structures and algorithms are often used.
    The programs follow the C++11 standard,
    which can be used in most contests nowadays.
    If you cannot program in C++ yet,
    now is a good time to start learning.

    \subsubsection{C++ code template}

    A typical C++ code template for competitive programming
    looks like this:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    #include <bits/stdc++.h>

    using namespace std;

    int main() {
        // solution comes here
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The \texttt{\#include} line at the beginning
    of the code is a feature of the \texttt{g++} compiler
    that allows us to include the entire standard library.
    Thus, it is not needed to separately include
    libraries such as \texttt{iostream},
    \texttt{vector} and \texttt{algorithm},
    but rather they are available automatically.

    The \texttt{using} line declares
    that the classes and functions
    of the standard library can be used directly
    in the code.
    Without the \texttt{using} line we would have
    to write, for example, \texttt{std::cout},
    but now it suffices to write \texttt{cout}.

    The code can be compiled using the following command:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall test.cpp -o test
    \end{lstlisting}

    This command produces a binary file \texttt{test}
    from the source code \texttt{test.cpp}.
    The compiler follows the C++11 standard
    (\texttt{-std=c++11}),
    optimizes the code (\texttt{-O2})
    and shows warnings about possible errors (\texttt{-Wall}).
