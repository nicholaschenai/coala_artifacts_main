INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/103 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that calculates the Eulerian number, denoted as A(n, m), which counts the number of permutations of n elements with exactly m ascents. An ascent is defined as a position in the permutation where the next element is greater than the current one.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To compute the Eulerian number A(n, m), we can use a recursive relationship based on the properties of permutations. The Eulerian numbers can be defined using the following recurrence relation:
   - A(n, 0) = 1 for all n >= 0 (there is one way to arrange n elements with no ascents).
   - A(n, n) = 0 for all n > 0 (there are no arrangements of n elements with n ascents).
   - For 0 < m < n, the relation is:
     A(n, m) = (m + 1) * A(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * A(n - 1, m - 1)
   This means that we can compute A(n, m) using previously computed values of A(n-1, m) and A(n-1, m-1).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function eulerian_num(n, m):
       if m == 0:
           return 1
       if n == m:
           return 0
       return (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def eulerian_num(n: int, m: int) -> int:
    # Base case: if m is 0, there is exactly one permutation with no ascents
    if m == 0:
        return 1
    # Base case: if n equals m, there are no permutations with n ascents
    if n == m:
        return 0
    # Recursive case: use the recurrence relation to calculate the Eulerian number
    return (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)

    Title: Euler's totient function
    Part: 1/1
    # Euler's totient function

    Euler's totient function, also known as **phi-function** $\phi (n)$, counts the number of integers between 1 and $n$ inclusive, which are coprime to $n$. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals $1$ ($1$ is considered to be coprime to any number).

    Here are values of $\phi(n)$ for the first few positive integers:

    $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 21 \\\\ \hline
    \phi(n) & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 4 & 6 & 4 & 10 & 4 & 12 & 6 & 8 & 8 & 16 & 6 & 18 & 8 & 12 \\\\ \hline
    \end{array}$$

    ## Properties

    The following properties of Euler totient function are sufficient to calculate it for any number:

      - If $p$ is a prime number, then $\gcd(p, q) = 1$ for all $1 \le q < p$. Therefore we have:
  
    $$\phi (p) = p - 1.$$

      - If $p$ is a prime number and $k \ge 1$, then there are exactly $p^k / p$ numbers between $1$ and $p^k$ that are divisible by $p$.
        Which gives us:
    
    $$\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}.$$

      - If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, then:
    
        \[\phi(a b) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b).\]
    
        This relation is not trivial to see. It follows from the [Chinese remainder theorem](chinese-remainder-theorem.md). The Chinese remainder theorem guarantees, that for each $0 \le x < a$ and each $0 \le y < b$, there exists a unique $0 \le z < a b$ with $z \equiv x \pmod{a}$ and $z \equiv y \pmod{b}$. It's not hard to show that $z$ is coprime to $a b$ if and only if $x$ is coprime to $a$ and $y$ is coprime to $b$. Therefore the amount of integers coprime to $a b$ is equal to product of the amounts of $a$ and $b$.

      - In general, for not coprime $a$ and $b$, the equation

        \[\phi(ab) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b) \cdot \dfrac{d}{\phi(d)}\]

        with $d = \gcd(a, b)$ holds.

    Thus, using the first three properties, we can compute $\phi(n)$ through the factorization of $n$ (decomposition of $n$ into a product of its prime factors).
    If $n = {p_1}^{a_1} \cdot {p_2}^{a_2} \cdots {p_k}^{a_k}$, where $p_i$ are prime factors of $n$,

    $$\begin{align}
    \phi (n) &= \phi ({p_1}^{a_1}) \cdot \phi ({p_2}^{a_2}) \cdots  \phi ({p_k}^{a_k}) \\\\
    &= \left({p_1}^{a_1} - {p_1}^{a_1 - 1}\right) \cdot \left({p_2}^{a_2} - {p_2}^{a_2 - 1}\right) \cdots \left({p_k}^{a_k} - {p_k}^{a_k - 1}\right) \\\\
    &= p_1^{a_1} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \cdots p_k^{a_k} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right) \\\\
    &= n \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \cdots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right)
    \end{align}$$

    ## Implementation

    Here is an implementation using factorization in $O(\sqrt{n})$:

    ```cpp
    int phi(int n) {
        int result = n;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                while (n % i == 0)
                    n /= i;
                result -= result / i;
            }
        }
        if (n > 1)
            result -= result / n;
        return result;
    }
    ```

    ## Euler totient function from $1$ to $n$ in $O(n \log\log{n})$ { #etf_1_to_n data-toc-label="Euler totient function from 1 to n in <script type=\"math/tex\">O(n log log n)</script>" }

    If we need all all the totient of all numbers between $1$ and $n$, then factorizing all $n$ numbers is not efficient.
    We can use the same idea as the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](sieve-of-eratosthenes.md).
    It is still based on the property shown above, but instead of updating the temporary result for each prime factor for each number, we find all prime numbers and for each one update the temporary results of all numbers that are divisible by that prime number.

    Since this approach is basically identical to the Sieve of Eratosthenes, the complexity will also be the same: $O(n \log \log n)$

    ```cpp
    void phi_1_to_n(int n) {
        vector<int> phi(n + 1);
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
            phi[i] = i;
    
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            if (phi[i] == i) {
                for (int j = i; j <= n; j += i)
                    phi[j] -= phi[j] / i;
            }
        }
    }
    ```


    ## Divisor sum property { #divsum}

    This interesting property was established by Gauss:

    $$ \sum_{d|n} \phi{(d)} = n$$

    Here the sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.

    For instance the divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10.
    Hence $\phi{(1)} + \phi{(2)} + \phi{(5)} + \phi{(10)} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10$.

    ### Finding the totient from 1 to $n$ using the divisor sum property { data-toc-label="Finding the totient from 1 to n using the divisor sum property" }

    The divisor sum property also allows us to compute the totient of all numbers between 1 and $n$.
    This implementation is a little simpler than the previous implementation based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes, however also has a slightly worse complexity: $O(n \log n)$

    ```cpp
    void phi_1_to_n(int n) {
        vector<int> phi(n + 1);
        phi[0] = 0;
        phi[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
            phi[i] = i - 1;
    
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
            for (int j = 2 * i; j <= n; j += i)
                  phi[j] -= phi[i];
    }
    ```

    ## Application in Euler's theorem { #application }

    The most famous and important property of Euler's totient function is expressed in **Euler's theorem**: 

    $$a^{\phi(m)} \equiv 1 \pmod m \quad \text{if } a \text{ and } m \text{ are relatively prime.}$$

    In the particular case when $m$ is prime, Euler's theorem turns into **Fermat's little theorem**:

    $$a^{m - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod m$$

    Euler's theorem and Euler's totient function occur quite often in practical applications, for example both are used to compute the [modular multiplicative inverse](module-inverse.md).

    As immediate consequence we also get the equivalence:

    $$a^n \equiv a^{n \bmod \phi(m)} \pmod m$$

    This allows computing $x^n \bmod m$ for very big $n$, especially if $n$ is the result of another computation, as it allows to compute $n$ under a modulo.

    ## Generalization

    There is a less known version of the last equivalence, that allows computing $x^n \bmod m$ efficiently for not coprime $x$ and $m$.
    For arbitrary $x, m$ and $n \geq \log_2 m$:

    $$x^{n}\equiv x^{\phi(m)+[n \bmod \phi(m)]} \mod m$$

    Proof:

    Let $p_1, \dots, p_t$ be common prime divisors of $x$ and $m$, and $k_i$ their exponents in $m$.
    With those we define $a = p_1^{k_1} \dots p_t^{k_t}$, which makes $\frac{m}{a}$ coprime to $x$.
    And let $k$ be the smallest number such that $a$ divides $x^k$.
    Assuming $n \ge k$, we can write:

    $$\begin{align}x^n \bmod m &= \frac{x^k}{a}ax^{n-k}\bmod m \\
    &= \frac{x^k}{a}\left(ax^{n-k}\bmod m\right) \bmod m \\
    &= \frac{x^k}{a}\left(ax^{n-k}\bmod a \frac{m}{a}\right) \bmod m \\
    &=\frac{x^k}{a} a \left(x^{n-k} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m \\
    &= x^k\left(x^{n-k} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m
    \end{align}$$

    The equivalence between the third and forth line follows from the fact that $ab \bmod ac = a(b \bmod c)$.
    Indeed if $b = cd + r$ with $r < c$, then $ab = acd + ar$ with $ar < ac$.

    Since $x$ and $\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime, we can apply Euler's theorem and get the efficient (since $k$ is very small; in fact $k \le \log_2 m$) formula:

    $$x^n \bmod m = x^k\left(x^{n-k \bmod \phi(\frac{m}{a})} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m.$$

    This formula is difficult to apply, but we can use it to analyze the behavior of $x^n \bmod m$. We can see that the sequence of powers $(x^1 \bmod m, x^2 \bmod m, x^3 \bmod m, \dots)$ enters a cycle of length $\phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)$ after the first $k$ (or less) elements. 
    $\phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)$ divides $\phi(m)$ (because $a$ and $\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime we have $\phi(a) \cdot \phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right) = \phi(m)$), therefore we can also say that the period has length $\phi(m)$.
    And since $\phi(m) \ge \log_2 m \ge k$, we can conclude the desired, much simpler, formula:

    $$ x^n \equiv x^{\phi(m)} x^{(n - \phi(m)) \bmod \phi(m)} \bmod m \equiv x^{\phi(m)+[n \bmod \phi(m)]} \mod m.$$

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 5/5
    ```

    The asymptotics of our solution is $O(n \log n)$, as for almost every number up to $n$ we make $n/i$ iterations on the nested loop.

    ### The number of permutations without fixed points (derangements)

    Prove that the number of permutations of length $n$ without fixed points (i.e. no number $i$ is in position $i$ - also called a derangement) is equal to the following number:

    $$n! - \binom{n}{1} \cdot (n-1)! + \binom{n}{2} \cdot (n-2)! - \binom{n}{3} \cdot (n-3)! + \cdots \pm \binom{n}{n} \cdot (n-n)! $$

    and approximately equal to:

    $$ \frac{ n! }{ e } $$

    (if you round this expression to the nearest whole number — you get exactly the number of permutations without fixed points)

    Denote by $A_k$ the set of permutations of length $n$ with a fixed point at position $k$ ($1 \le k \le n$) (i.e. element $k$ is at position $k$).

    We now use the formula of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of permutations with at least one fixed point. For this we need to learn to count sizes of an intersection of sets $A_i$, as follows:

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    \left| A_p \right| &=& (n-1)!\ , \\
    \left| A_p \cap A_q \right| &=& (n-2)!\ , \\
    \left| A_p \cap A_q \cap A_r \right| &=& (n-3)!\ , \\
    \cdots ,
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    because if we know that the number of fixed points is equal $x$, then we know the position of $x$ elements of the permutation, and all other $(n-x)$ elements can be placed anywhere.

    Substituting this into the formula of inclusion-exclusion, and given that the number of ways to choose a subset of size $x$ from the set of $n$ elements is equal to $\binom{n}{x}$, we obtain a formula for the number of permutations with at least one fixed point:

    $$\binom{n}{1} \cdot (n-1)! - \binom{n}{2} \cdot (n-2)! + \binom{n}{3} \cdot (n-3)! - \cdots \pm \binom{n}{n} \cdot (n-n)! $$

    Then the number of permutations without fixed points is equal to:

    $$n! - \binom{n}{1} \cdot (n-1)! + \binom{n}{2} \cdot (n-2)! - \binom{n}{3} \cdot (n-3)! + \cdots \pm \binom{n}{n} \cdot (n-n)! $$

    Simplifying this expression, we obtain **exact and approximate expressions for the number of permutations without fixed points**:

    $$ n! \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \cdots \pm \frac{1}{n!} \right ) \approx \frac{n!}{e} $$

    (because the sum in brackets are the first $n+1$ terms of the expansion in Taylor series $e^{-1}$)

    It is worth noting that a similar problem can be solved this way: when you need the fixed points were not among the $m$ first elements of permutations (and not among all, as we just solved). The formula obtained is as the given above accurate formula, but it will go up to the sum of $k$, instead of $n$.

    Title: Finding the Eulerian path in $O(M)$
    Part: 1/1
    # Finding the Eulerian path in $O(M)$

    A Eulerian path is a path in a graph that passes through all of its edges exactly once.
    A Eulerian cycle is a Eulerian path that is a cycle.

    The problem is to find the Eulerian path in an **undirected multigraph with loops**.

    ## Algorithm

    First we can check if there is an Eulerian path.
    We can use the following theorem. An Eulerian cycle exists if and only if the degrees of all vertices are even.
    And an Eulerian path exists if and only if the number of vertices with odd degrees is two (or zero, in the case of the existence of a Eulerian cycle).
    In addition, of course, the graph must be sufficiently connected (i.e., if you remove all isolated vertices from it, you should get a connected graph).

    To find the Eulerian path / Eulerian cycle we can use the following strategy:
    We find all simple cycles and combine them into one - this will be the Eulerian cycle.
    If the graph is such that the Eulerian path is not a cycle, then add the missing edge, find the Eulerian cycle, then remove the extra edge.

    Looking for all cycles and combining them can be done with a simple recursive procedure:

    ```nohighlight
    procedure FindEulerPath(V)
      1. iterate through all the edges outgoing from vertex V;
           remove this edge from the graph,
           and call FindEulerPath from the second end of this edge;
      2. add vertex V to the answer.
    ```

    The complexity of this algorithm is obviously linear with respect to the number of edges.

    But we can write the same algorithm in the non-recursive version:

    ```nohighlight
    stack St;
    put start vertex in St;
    until St is empty
      let V be the value at the top of St;
      if degree(V) = 0, then
        add V to the answer;
        remove V from the top of St;
      otherwise
        find any edge coming out of V;
        remove it from the graph;
        put the second end of this edge in St;
    ```

    It is easy to check the equivalence of these two forms of the algorithm. However, the second form is obviously faster, and the code will be much more efficient.

    ## The Domino problem

    We give here a classical Eulerian cycle problem - the Domino problem.

    There are $N$ dominoes, as it is known, on both ends of the Domino one number is written(usually from 1 to 6, but in our case it is not important). You want to put all the dominoes in a row so that the numbers on any two adjacent dominoes, written on their common side, coincide. Dominoes are allowed to turn.

    Reformulate the problem. Let the numbers written on the bottoms be the vertices of the graph, and the dominoes be the edges of this graph (each Domino with numbers $(a,b)$ are the edges $(a,b)$ and $(b, a)$). Then our problem is reduced to the problem of finding the Eulerian path in this graph.

    ## Implementation

    The program below searches for and outputs a Eulerian loop or path in a graph, or outputs $-1$ if it does not exist.

    First, the program checks the degree of vertices: if there are no vertices with an odd degree, then the graph has an Euler cycle, if there are $2$ vertices with an odd degree, then in the graph there is only an Euler path (but no Euler cycle), if there are more than $2$ such vertices, then in the graph there is no Euler cycle or Euler path.
    To find the Euler path (not a cycle), let's do this: if $V1$ and $V2$ are two vertices of odd degree, then just add an edge $(V1, V2)$, in the resulting graph we find the Euler cycle (it will obviously exist), and then remove the "fictitious" edge $(V1, V2)$ from the answer.
    We will look for the Euler cycle exactly as described above (non-recursive version), and at the same time at the end of this algorithm we will check whether the graph was connected or not (if the graph was not connected, then at the end of the algorithm some edges will remain in the graph, and in this case we need to print $-1$).
    Finally, the program takes into account that there can be isolated vertices in the graph.

    Notice that we use an adjacency matrix in this problem.
    Also this implementation handles finding the next with brute-force, which requires to iterate over the complete row in the matrix over and over.
    A better way would be to store the graph as an adjacency list, and remove edges in $O(1)$ and mark the reversed edges in separate list.
    This way we can archive a $O(N)$ algorithm.

    ```cpp
    int main() {
        int n;
        vector<vector<int>> g(n, vector<int>(n));
        // reading the graph in the adjacency matrix

        vector<int> deg(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
                deg[i] += g[i][j];
        }

        int first = 0;
        while (first < n && !deg[first])
            ++first;
        if (first == n) {
            cout << -1;
            return 0;

        bool bad = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/103 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that calculates the Eulerian number \( a(n, m) \). The Eulerian number represents the number of permutations of \( n \) elements with exactly \( m \) ascents. An ascent is defined as a position \( i \) where the \( i \)-th element is less than the \( (i+1) \)-th element.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To compute the Eulerian number \( a(n, m) \), we can use a recursive relationship based on the properties of permutations. The Eulerian numbers can be computed using the following recurrence relation:
   - \( a(n, m) = (m + 1) \cdot a(n - 1, m) + (n - m) \cdot a(n - 1, m - 1) \)
   - Base cases:
     - \( a(0, 0) = 1 \) (the empty permutation)
     - \( a(n, 0) = 1 \) for all \( n \geq 0 \) (only one way to arrange \( n \) elements with no ascents)
     - \( a(n, n) = 1 \) (only one way to arrange \( n \) elements with \( n \) ascents)

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function eulerian_num(n, m):
       if m == 0:
           return 1
       if n == 0:
           return 0
       if m > n:
           return 0
       return (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def eulerian_num(n: int, m: int) -> int:
    # Base case: if there are no elements and no ascents, there's one way (the empty permutation)
