    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the Eulerian number \\( a(n, m) \\). The Eulerian number represents the number of permutations of \\( n \\) elements with exactly \\( m \\) ascents. An ascent is defined as a position \\( i \\) where the \\( i \\)-th element is less than the \\( (i+1) \\)-th element.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To compute the Eulerian number \\( a(n, m) \\), we can use a recursive relationship based on the properties of permutations. The Eulerian numbers can be computed using the following recurrence relation:\n   - \\( a(n, m) = (m + 1) \\cdot a(n - 1, m) + (n - m) \\cdot a(n - 1, m - 1) \\)\n   - Base cases:\n     - \\( a(0, 0) = 1 \\) (the empty permutation)\n     - \\( a(n, 0) = 1 \\) for all \\( n \\geq 0 \\) (only one way to arrange \\( n \\) elements with no ascents)\n     - \\( a(n, n) = 1 \\) (only one way to arrange \\( n \\) elements with \\( n \\) ascents)\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function eulerian_num(n, m):\n       if m == 0:\n           return 1\n       if n == 0:\n           return 0\n       if m > n:\n           return 0\n       return (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef eulerian_num(n: int, m: int) -> int:\n    # Base case: if there are no elements and no ascents, there's one way (the empty permutation)\n    if m == 0:\n        return 1\n    # If there are no elements, there can't be any ascents\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    # If the number of ascents is greater than the number of elements, it's impossible\n    if m > n:\n        return 0\n    # Recursive case: use the recurrence relation to calculate the Eulerian number\n    return (m + 1) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m) + (n - m) * eulerian_num(n - 1, m - 1)\n```",
