INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/93 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two numbers, 'a' and 'b', and calculates 'a' raised to the power of 'b'. For example, if 'a' is 3 and 'b' is 4, the function should return 81, since 3 to the power of 4 equals 81.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To calculate 'a' to the power of 'b', we can use a loop to multiply 'a' by itself 'b' times. If 'b' is 0, we should return 1, since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. If 'b' is negative, we can calculate the positive power and then take the reciprocal of the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function power(a, b):
       if b is 0:
           return 1
       if b is negative:
           result = 1
           for i from 1 to abs(b):
               result = result * a
           return 1 / result
       result = 1

           result = result * a
       return result
   ```

        result = 1
        # Calculate the positive power

    Title: Binary Exponentiation
    Part: 1/2
    # Binary Exponentiation

    Binary exponentiation (also known as exponentiation by squaring) is a trick which allows to calculate $a^n$ using only $O(\log n)$ multiplications (instead of $O(n)$ multiplications required by the naive approach).

    It also has important applications in many tasks unrelated to arithmetic, since it
    can be used with any operations that have the property of **associativity**:

    $$(X \cdot Y) \cdot Z = X \cdot (Y \cdot Z)$$

    Most obviously this applies to modular multiplication, to multiplication of matrices and
    to other problems which we will discuss below.

    ## Algorithm

    Raising $a$ to the power of $n$ is expressed naively as multiplication by $a$ done $n - 1$ times:
    $a^{n} = a \cdot a \cdot \ldots \cdot a$. However, this approach is not practical for large $a$ or $n$.

    $a^{b+c} = a^b \cdot a^c$ and $a^{2b} = a^b \cdot a^b = (a^b)^2$.

    The idea of binary exponentiation is, that we split the work using the binary representation of the exponent.

    Let's write $n$ in base 2, for example:

    $$3^{13} = 3^{1101_2} = 3^8 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 3^1$$

    Since the number $n$ has exactly $\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor + 1$ digits in base 2, we only need to perform $O(\log n)$ multiplications, if we know the powers $a^1, a^2, a^4, a^8, \dots, a^{2^{\lfloor \log n \rfloor}}$.

    So we only need to know a fast way to compute those.
    Luckily this is very easy, since an element in the sequence is just the square of the previous element.

    $$\begin{align}
    3^1 &= 3 \\
    3^2 &= \left(3^1\right)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\
    3^4 &= \left(3^2\right)^2 = 9^2 = 81 \\
    3^8 &= \left(3^4\right)^2 = 81^2 = 6561
    \end{align}$$

    So to get the final answer for $3^{13}$, we only need to multiply three of them (skipping $3^2$ because the corresponding bit in $n$ is not set):
    $3^{13} = 6561 \cdot 81 \cdot 3 = 1594323$

    The final complexity of this algorithm is $O(\log n)$: we have to compute $\log n$ powers of $a$, and then have to do at most $\log n$ multiplications to get the final answer from them.

    The following recursive approach expresses the same idea:

    $$a^n = \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if } n == 0 \\
    \left(a^{\frac{n}{2}}\right)^2 &\text{if } n > 0 \text{ and } n \text{ even}\\
    \left(a^{\frac{n - 1}{2}}\right)^2 \cdot a &\text{if } n > 0 \text{ and } n \text{ odd}\\
    \end{cases}$$

    ## Implementation

    First the recursive approach, which is a direct translation of the recursive formula:

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
        if (b == 0)
            return 1;
        long long res = binpow(a, b / 2);
        if (b % 2)
            return res * res * a;
        else
            return res * res;
    }
    ```

    The second approach accomplishes the same task without recursion.
    It computes all the powers in a loop, and multiplies the ones with the corresponding set bit in $n$.
    Although the complexity of both approaches is identical, this approach will be faster in practice since we don't have the overhead of the recursive calls.

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
        long long res = 1;
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1)
                res = res * a;
            a = a * a;
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```

    ## Applications

    ### Effective computation of large exponents modulo a number

    **Problem:**
    Compute $x^n \bmod m$.
    This is a very common operation. For instance it is used in computing the [modular multiplicative inverse](module-inverse.md).

    **Solution:**
    Since we know that the modulo operator doesn't interfere with multiplications ($a \cdot b \equiv (a \bmod m) \cdot (b \bmod m) \pmod m$), we can directly use the same code, and just replace every multiplication with a modular multiplication:

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b, long long m) {
        a %= m;
        long long res = 1;
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1)
                res = res * a % m;
            a = a * a % m;
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```

    **Note:**
    It's possible to speed this algorithm for large $b >> m$.
    If $m$ is a prime number $x^n \equiv x^{n \bmod (m-1)} \pmod{m}$ for prime $m$, and $x^n \equiv x^{n \bmod{\phi(m)}} \pmod{m}$ for composite $m$.
    This follows directly from Fermat's little theorem and Euler's theorem, see the article about [Modular Inverses](module-inverse.md#fermat-euler) for more details.

    ### Effective computation of Fibonacci numbers

    **Problem:** Compute $n$-th Fibonacci number $F_n$.

    **Solution:** For more details, see the [Fibonacci Number article](fibonacci-numbers.md).
    We will only go through an overview of the algorithm.
    To compute the next Fibonacci number, only the two previous ones are needed, as $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
    We can build a $2 \times 2$ matrix that describes this transformation:
    the transition from $F_i$ and $F_{i+1}$ to $F_{i+1}$ and $F_{i+2}$.
    For example, applying this transformation to the pair $F_0$ and $F_1$ would change it into $F_1$ and $F_2$.
    Therefore, we can raise this transformation matrix to the $n$-th power to find $F_n$ in time complexity $O(\log n)$.

    ### Applying a permutation $k$ times { data-toc-label='Applying a permutation <script type="math/tex">k</script> times' }

    **Problem:** You are given a sequence of length $n$. Apply to it a given permutation $k$ times.

    **Solution:** Simply raise the permutation to $k$-th power using binary exponentiation, and then apply it to the sequence. This will give you a time complexity of $O(n \log k)$.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> applyPermutation(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation) {
        vector<int> newSequence(sequence.size());
        for(int i = 0; i < sequence.size(); i++) {
            newSequence[i] = sequence[permutation[i]];
        }
        return newSequence;
    }

    vector<int> permute(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation, long long b) {
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1) {
                sequence = applyPermutation(sequence, permutation);
            }
            permutation = applyPermutation(permutation, permutation);
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return sequence;
    }

    ```

        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\frac{x+y \sqrt{n}}{z}$.

    !!! example "[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)"
        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

    Title: Operations on polynomials and series
    Part: 1/4
    # Operations on polynomials and series

    Problems in competitive programming, especially the ones involving enumeration some kind, are often solved by reducing the problem to computing something on polynomials and formal power series.

    This includes concepts such as polynomial multiplication, interpolation, and more complicated ones, such as polynomial logarithms and exponents. In this article, a brief overview of such operations and common approaches to them is presented.

    ## Basic Notion and facts

    In this section, we focus more on the definitions and "intuitive" properties of various polynomial operations. The technical details of their implementation and complexities will be covered in later sections.

    ### Polynomial multiplication

    !!! info "Definition"
    	**Univariate polynomial** is an expression of form $A(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_n x^n$.

    The values $a_0, \dots, a_n$ are polynomial coefficients, typically taken from some set of numbers or number-like structures. In this article, we assume that the coefficients are taken from some [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)), meaning that operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are well-defined for them (except for division by $0$) and they generally behave in a similar way to real numbers.
	
    Typical example of such field is the field of remainders modulo prime number $p$.

    For simplicity we will drop the term _univariate_, as this is the only kind of polynomials we consider in this article. We will also write $A$ instead of $A(x)$ wherever possible, which will be understandable from the context. It is assumed that either $a_n \neq 0$ or $A(x)=0$.

    !!! info "Definition"
    	The **product** of two polynomials is defined by expanding it as an arithmetic expression:

    	$$
    	A(x) B(x) = \left(\sum\limits_{i=0}^n a_i x^i \right)\left(\sum\limits_{j=0}^m b_j x^j\right) = \sum\limits_{i,j} a_i b_j x^{i+j} = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n+m} c_k x^k = C(x).
    	$$

    	The sequence $c_0, c_1, \dots, c_{n+m}$ of the coefficients of $C(x)$ is called the **convolution** of $a_0, \dots, a_n$ and $b_0, \dots, b_m$.

    !!! info "Definition"
    	The **degree** of a polynomial $A$ with $a_n \neq 0$ is defined as $\deg A = n$.
	
    	For consistency, degree of $A(x) = 0$ is defined as $\deg A = -\infty$.

    In this notion, $\deg AB = \deg A + \deg B$ for any polynomials $A$ and $B$.

    Convolutions are the basis of solving many enumerative problems.

    !!! Example
    	You have $n$ objects of the first kind and $m$ objects of the second kind.

    	Objects of first kind are valued $a_1, \dots, a_n$, and objects of the second kind are valued $b_1, \dots, b_m$.

    	You pick a single object of the first kind and a single object of the second kind. How many ways are there to get the total value $k$?

    ??? hint "Solution"
    	Consider the product $(x^{a_1} + \dots + x^{a_n})(x^{b_1} + \dots + x^{b_m})$. If you expand it, each monomial will correspond to the pair $(a_i, b_j)$ and contribute to the coefficient near $x^{a_i+b_j}$. In other words, the answer is the coefficient near $x^k$ in the product.

    !!! Example
    	You throw a $6$-sided die $n$ times and sum up the results from all throws. What is the probability of getting sum of $k$?

    ??? hint "Solution"
    	The answer is the number of outcomes having the sum $k$, divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $6^n$.

    	What is the number of outcomes having the sum $k$? For $n=1$, it may be represented by a polynomial $A(x) = x^1+x^2+\dots+x^6$.

    	For $n=2$, using the same approach as in the example above, we conclude that it is represented by the polynomial $(x^1+x^2+\dots+x^6)^2$.

    	That being said, the answer to the problem is the $k$-th coefficient of $(x^1+x^2+\dots+x^6)^n$, divided by $6^n$.

    The coefficient near $x^k$ in the polynomial $A(x)$ is denoted shortly as $[x^k]A$.

    ### Formal power series

    !!! info "Definition"
    	A **formal power series** is an infinite sum $A(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots$, considered regardless of its convergence properties.

    In other words, when we consider e.g. a sum $1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\dots=2$, we imply that it _converges_ to $2$ when the number of summands approach infinity. However, formal series are only considered in terms of sequences that make them.

    !!! info "Definition"
    	The **product** of formal power series $A(x)$ and $B(x)$, is also defined by expanding it as an arithmetic expression:


    	$$
    	A(x) B(x) = \left(\sum\limits_{i=0}^\infty a_i x^i \right)\left(\sum\limits_{j=0}^\infty b_j x^j\right) = \sum\limits_{i,j} a_i b_j x^{i+j} = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k x^k = C(x),
    	$$

    	where the coefficients $c_0, c_1, \dots$ are define as finite sums

    	$$
    	c_k = \sum\limits_{i=0}^k a_i b_{k-i}.
    	$$

    	The sequence $c_0, c_1, \dots$ is also called a **convolution** of $a_0, a_1, \dots$ and $b_0, b_1, \dots$, generalizing the concept to infinite sequences.

    Thus, polynomials may be considered formal power series, but with finite number of coefficients.

    Formal power series play a crucial role in enumerative combinatorics, where they're studied as [generating functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function) for various sequences. Detailed explanation of generating functions and the intuition behind them will, unfortunately, be out of scope for this article, therefore the curious reader is referenced e.g. [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/103979) for details about their combinatorial meaning.

    However, we will very briefly mention that if $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ are generating functions for sequences that enumerate some objects by number of "atoms" in them (e.g. trees by the number of vertices), then the product $A(x) B(x)$ enumerates objects that can be described as pairs of objects of kinds $A$ and $B$, enumerates by the total number of "atoms" in the pair.

    !!! Example
    	Let $A(x) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^\infty 2^i x^i$ enumerate packs of stones, each stone colored in one of $2$ colors (so, there are $2^i$ such packs of size $i$) and $B(x) = \sum\limits_{j=0}^{\infty} 3^j x^j$ enumerate packs of stones, each stone colored in one of $3$ colors. Then $C(x) = A(x) B(x) = \sum\limits_{k=0}^\infty c_k x^k$ would enumerate objects that may be described as "two packs of stones, first pack only of stones of type $A$, second pack only of stones of type $B$, with total number of stones being $k$" for $c_k$.

    In a similar way, there is an intuitive meaning to some other functions over formal power series.

    ### Long polynomial division

    Similar to integers, it is possible to define long division on polynomials.

    !!! info "Definition"

    	For any polynomials $A$ and $B \neq 0$, one may represent $A$ as

    	$$
    	A = D \cdot B + R,~ \deg R < \deg B,
    	$$

    	where $R$ is called the **remainder** of $A$ modulo $B$ and $D$ is called the **quotient**.

    Denoting $\deg A = n$ and $\deg B = m$, naive way to do it is to use long division, during which you multiply $B$ by the monomial $\frac{a_n}{b_m} x^{n - m}$ and subtract it from $A$, until the degree of $A$ is smaller than that of $B$. What remains of $A$ in the end will be the remainder (hence the name), and the polynomials with which you multiplied $B$ in the process, summed together, form the quotient.

    !!! info "Definition"
    	If $A$ and $B$ have the same remainder modulo $C$, they're said to be **equivalent** modulo $C$, which is denoted as
	
    	$$
    	A \equiv B \pmod{C}.
    	$$
	
    Polynomial long division is useful because of its many important properties:

    - $A$ is a multiple of $B$ if and only if $A \equiv 0 \pmod B$.

    - It implies that $A \equiv B \pmod C$ if and only if $A-B$ is a multiple of $C$.

    - In particular, $A \equiv B \pmod{C \cdot D}$ implies $A \equiv B \pmod{C}$.

    - For any linear polynomial $x-r$ it holds that $A(x) \equiv A(r) \pmod{x-r}$.

    - It implies that $A$ is a multiple of $x-r$ if and only if $A(r)=0$.

    - For modulo being $x^k$, it holds that $A \equiv a_0 + a_1 x + \dots + a_{k-1} x^{k-1} \pmod{x^k}$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/93 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   We need to create a Python function that calculates the value of a number 'a' raised to the power of 'b' (i.e., \( a^b \)). The function should be able to handle any integer values for 'a' and 'b'.

2. **Conceptualization of the Solution**: 
   The simplest way to compute \( a^b \) is to multiply 'a' by itself 'b' times. However, this approach is inefficient for large values of 'b'. Instead, we can use a more efficient method called binary exponentiation, which reduces the number of multiplications needed by leveraging the properties of exponents. This method works by breaking down the exponent into smaller parts based on its binary representation.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function power(a, b):
       if b == 0:
           return 1
       if b is even:
           half_power = power(a, b // 2)
           return half_power * half_power
       else:
           return a * power(a, b - 1)
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def power(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Base case: any number to the power of 0 is 1
    if b == 0:
        return 1
    # If b is even, use the property a^b = (a^(b/2))^2
    if b % 2 == 0:
        half_power = power(a, b // 2)
        return half_power * half_power
    # If b is odd, use the property a^b = a * a^(b-1)
    else:
        return a * power(a, b - 1)
