    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that calculates the median length of a trapezium given the lengths of its two parallel sides. The function should take three parameters: the lengths of the two parallel sides and the height of the trapezium. The expected output is the median length of the trapezium.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the median length of a trapezium, we can use the formula for the median of a trapezium, which is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Median} = \\frac{(a + b)}{2}\n   \\]\n   where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the lengths of the two parallel sides. The height of the trapezium is not needed for calculating the median length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION median_trapezium(a, b, height):\n       median_length = (a + b) / 2\n       RETURN median_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Function to calculate the median length of a trapezium\ndef median_trapezium(a: int, b: int, height: int) -> float:\n    # Calculate the median length using the formula\n    median_length = (a + b) / 2\n    # Return the calculated median length\n    return median_length\n```",
