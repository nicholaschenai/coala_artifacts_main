    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the median of those three numbers. The median is the middle value when the numbers are sorted.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the median of three numbers, we can sort the three numbers and then select the second number from the sorted list, as it will be the median. Since there are only three numbers, this approach is efficient and straightforward.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function median_numbers(a, b, c):\n       create a list with a, b, c\n       sort the list\n       return the second element of the sorted list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef median_numbers(a: float, b: float, c: float) -> float:\n    # Create a list with the three numbers\n    numbers = [a, b, c]\n    # Sort the list\n    numbers.sort()\n    # Return the second element, which is the median\n    return numbers[1]\n```",
