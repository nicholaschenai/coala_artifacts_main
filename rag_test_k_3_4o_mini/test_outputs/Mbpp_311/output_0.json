    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes an integer as input and sets the leftmost bit that is currently unset (0) to 1. The output should be the new integer after this modification.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to identify the leftmost unset bit in the binary representation of the given integer. Once we find this bit, we can set it to 1. The leftmost unset bit can be found by shifting the bits of the number to the right until we encounter a 0. We can then use a bitwise OR operation to set this bit.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function set_left_most_unset_bit(n):\n       Initialize a variable 'mask' to 1\n       Initialize a variable 'position' to 0\n       \n       while n is not 0:\n           if (n & mask) is 0:\n               break\n           mask = mask << 1\n           position += 1\n       \n       return n | mask\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize a variable 'mask' to 1, which will help us find the leftmost unset bit\n    mask = 1\n    \n    # Loop to find the leftmost unset bit\n    while n & mask:  # While the current bit in n is set (1)\n        mask <<= 1    # Shift mask to the left to check the next bit\n    \n    # Set the leftmost unset bit in n using bitwise OR\n    return n | mask\n\n```",
