On this board there are $15$ playing tiles numbered from 1 to 15. One cell is left empty (denoted by 0). You need to get the board to the position presented below by repeatedly moving one of the tiles to the free space:\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\ 13 & 14 & 15 & 0 \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    The game \"15 Puzzle\u201d was created by Noyes Chapman in 1880.\n\n    ## Existence Of The Solution\n\n    Let's consider this problem: given a position on the board, determine whether a sequence of moves which leads to a solution exists.\n\n    Suppose we have some position on the board:\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \\\\ a_5 & a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \\\\ a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    where one of the elements equals zero and indicates an empty cell $a_z  = 0$\n\n    Let\u2019s consider the permutation:\n\n    $$a_1 a_2 ... a_{z-1} a_{z+1} ... a_{15} a_{16}$$\n\n    i.e. the permutation of numbers corresponding to the position on the board without a zero element\n\n    Let $N$ be the number of inversions in this permutation (i.e. the number of such elements $a_i$  and $a_j$  that $i < j$, but $a_i  > a_j$).\n\n    Suppose $K$ is an index of a row where the empty element is located (i.e. using our convention, $K = (z - 1) \\div \\ 4 + 1$).\n\n    Then, **the solution exists iff $N + K$ is even**.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    The algorithm above can be illustrated with the following program code:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int a[16];\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        cin >> a[i];\n\n    int inv = 0;\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        if (a[i])\n            for (int j=0; j<i; ++j)\n                if (a[j] > a[i])\n                    ++inv;\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        if (a[i] == 0)\n            inv += 1 + i / 4;\n\n    puts ((inv & 1) ? \"No Solution\" : \"Solution Exists\");\n    ```\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    In 1879 Johnson proved that if $N + K$ is odd, then the solution doesn\u2019t exist, and in the same year Story proved that all positions when $N + K$ is even have a solution.\n\n    However, all these proofs were quite complex.\n\n    In 1999 Archer proposed a much simpler proof (you can download his article [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf)).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Primality tests\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n\n    It's also possible to do the check with only 7 bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504 and 1795265022.\n    However, since these numbers (except 2) are not prime, you need to check additionally if the number you are checking is equal to any prime divisor of those bases: 2, 3, 5, 13, 19, 73, 193, 407521, 299210837.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n    Part: 2/5\n    <div id=\"the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation\"></div>\n    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }\n\n    Consider the following equation:\n\n    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$\n\n    where $0 \\le x_i \\le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\\ldots 6)$.\n\n    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.\n\n    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):\n    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:\n\n    $$N_0 = \\binom{25}{5}$$\n\n    We will now calculate the number of \"bad\" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The \"bad\" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.\n\n    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \\ge 9$, and all other $x_i \\ge 0 ~ (i \\ne k)$ (they may be $\\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:\n\n    $$ | A_k | = \\binom{16}{5} $$\n\n    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \\ne p$) is equal to:\n\n    $$ \\left| A_k \\cap A_p \\right| = \\binom{7}{5}$$\n\n    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.\n\n    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:\n\n    $$\\binom{25}{5} - \\left(\\binom{6}{1} \\cdot \\binom{16}{5} - \\binom{6}{2} \\cdot \\binom{7}{5}\\right) $$\n\n    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval\n\n    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).\n\n    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.\n\n    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\\cdots k)$.\n\n    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:\n\n    $$ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{ r }{ p_i } \\right\\rfloor $$\n\n    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.\n\n    Here is a C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int solve (int n, int r) {\n    \tvector<int> p;\n    \tfor (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)\n    \t\tif (n % i == 0) {\n    \t\t\tp.push_back (i);\n    \t\t\twhile (n % i == 0)\n    \t\t\t\tn /= i;\n    \t\t}\n    \tif (n > 1)\n    \t\tp.push_back (n);\n\n    \tint sum = 0;\n    \tfor (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {\n    \t\tint mult = 1,\n    \t\t\tbits = 0;\n    \t\tfor (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)\n    \t\t\tif (msk & (1<<i)) {\n    \t\t\t\t++bits;\n    \t\t\t\tmult *= p[i];\n    \t\t\t}\n\n    \t\tint cur = r / mult;\n    \t\tif (bits % 2 == 1)\n    \t\t\tsum += cur;\n    \t\telse\n    \t\t\tsum -= cur;\n    \t}\n\n    \treturn r - sum;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
