INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/472 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given list of numbers contains consecutive integers. Consecutive integers are numbers that follow one after the other without any gaps.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the numbers in the list are consecutive, we can follow these steps:
   - First, we need to sort the list of numbers.
   - Then, we will check if each number in the sorted list is exactly one more than the previous number.
   - If we find any number that does not follow this pattern, we will conclude that the list does not contain consecutive numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_Consecutive(numbers):
       if the list is empty:
           return False
       sort the list of numbers
       for i from 1 to length of numbers - 1:
           if numbers[i] is not equal to numbers[i - 1] + 1:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def check_Consecutive(numbers):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not numbers:
        return False
    
    # Sort the list of numbers
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Check for consecutive numbers
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # If the current number is not equal to the previous number + 1, return False
        if numbers[i] != numbers[i - 1] + 1:
            return False
            
    # If all checks passed, return True
    return True

    Title: 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution
    Part: 1/1
    # 15 Puzzle Game: Existence Of The Solution

    This game is played on a $4 \times 4$ board. On this board there are $15$ playing tiles numbered from 1 to 15. One cell is left empty (denoted by 0). You need to get the board to the position presented below by repeatedly moving one of the tiles to the free space:

    $$\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\ 13 & 14 & 15 & 0 \end{matrix}$$

    The game "15 Puzzle‚Äù was created by Noyes Chapman in 1880.

    ## Existence Of The Solution

    Let's consider this problem: given a position on the board, determine whether a sequence of moves which leads to a solution exists.

    Suppose we have some position on the board:

    $$\begin{matrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \\ a_5 & a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \\ a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} \end{matrix}$$

    where one of the elements equals zero and indicates an empty cell $a_z  = 0$

    Let‚Äôs consider the permutation:

    $$a_1 a_2 ... a_{z-1} a_{z+1} ... a_{15} a_{16}$$

    i.e. the permutation of numbers corresponding to the position on the board without a zero element

    Let $N$ be the number of inversions in this permutation (i.e. the number of such elements $a_i$  and $a_j$  that $i < j$, but $a_i  > a_j$).

    Suppose $K$ is an index of a row where the empty element is located (i.e. using our convention, $K = (z - 1) \div \ 4 + 1$).

    Then, **the solution exists iff $N + K$ is even**.

    ## Implementation

    The algorithm above can be illustrated with the following program code:

    ```cpp
    int a[16];
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        cin >> a[i];

    int inv = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        if (a[i])
            for (int j=0; j<i; ++j)
                if (a[j] > a[i])
                    ++inv;
    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)
        if (a[i] == 0)
            inv += 1 + i / 4;

    puts ((inv & 1) ? "No Solution" : "Solution Exists");
    ```

    ## Proof

    In 1879 Johnson proved that if $N + K$ is odd, then the solution doesn‚Äôt exist, and in the same year Story proved that all positions when $N + K$ is even have a solution.

    However, all these proofs were quite complex.

    In 1999 Archer proposed a much simpler proof (you can download his article [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf)).

    However, since these numbers (except 2) are not prime, you need to check additionally if the number you are checking is equal to any prime divisor of those bases: 2, 3, 5, 13, 19, 73, 193, 407521, 299210837.

    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }
