    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that checks if all characters in a given string are the same. If they are the same, the function should return `True`, and if they are not, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and compare each character to the first character. If we find any character that is different from the first one, we can immediately return `False`. If we finish checking all characters and they are all the same, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function all_Characters_Same(s):\n       if the string is empty:\n           return True\n       first_character = s[0]\n       for each character in s:\n           if character is not equal to first_character:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is empty\n    if not s:\n        return True  # An empty string can be considered as having all same characters\n    first_character = s[0]  # Store the first character\n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for character in s:\n        # If any character is different from the first one\n        if character != first_character:\n            return False  # Return False if a different character is found\n    return True  # Return True if all characters are the same\n```",
