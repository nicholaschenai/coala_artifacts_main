i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0;

Bentley's\n    book \\emph{Programming Pearls} \\cite{ben86} made the problem popular.}.\n    The problem is interesting when there may be\n    negative values in the array.\n    For example, in the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    \\begin{samepage}\n    the following subarray produces the maximum sum $10$:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (6,1);\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    \\end{samepage}\n\n    We assume that an empty subarray is allowed,\n    so the maximum subarray sum is always at least $0$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    A straightforward way to solve the problem\n    is to go through all possible subarrays,\n    calculate the sum of values in each subarray and maintain\n    the maximum sum.\n    The following code implements this algorithm:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int best = 0;\n    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {\n        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {\n            int sum = 0;\n            for (int k = a; k <= b; k++) {\n                sum += array[k];\n            }\n            best = max(best,sum);\n        }\n    }\n    cout << best << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The variables \\texttt{a} and \\texttt{b} fix the first and\n    last index of the subarray,\n    and the sum of values is calculated to the variable \\texttt{sum}.\n    The variable \\texttt{best} contains the maximum sum found during the search.\n\n    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^3)$,\n    because it consists of three nested loops \n    that go through the input.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    It is easy to make Algorithm 1 more efficient\n    by removing one loop from it.\n    This is possible by calculating the sum at the same\n    time when the right end of the subarray moves.\n    The result is the following code:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int best = 0;\n    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {\n        int sum = 0;\n        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {\n            sum += array[b];\n            best = max(best,sum);\n        }\n    }\n    cout << best << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this change, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 3}\n\n    Surprisingly, it is possible to solve the problem\n    in $O(n)$ time\\footnote{In \\cite{ben86}, this linear-time algorithm\n    is attributed to J. B. Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes\n    called \\index{Kadane's algorithm} \\key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means\n    that just one loop is enough.\n    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,\n    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.\n    After this, the answer for the problem is the\n    maximum of those sums.\n\n    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray\n    that ends at position $k$.\n    There are two possibilities:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.\n    \\item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends\n    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    In the latter case, since we want to\n    find a subarray with maximum sum,\n    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$\n    should also have the maximum sum.\n    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently\n    by calculating the maximum subarray sum\n    for each ending position from left to right.\n\n    The following code implements the algorithm:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int best = 0, sum = 0;\n    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);\n        best = max(best,sum);\n    }\n    cout << best << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The algorithm only contains one loop\n    that goes through the input,\n    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.\n    This is also the best possible time complexity,\n    because any algorithm for the problem\n    has to examine all array elements at least once.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    It is interesting to study how efficient \n    algorithms are in practice.\n    The following table shows the running times\n    of the above algorithms for different\n    values of $n$ on a modern computer.\n\n    In each test, the input was generated randomly.\n    The time needed for reading the input was not\n    measured.\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n    array size $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $10^2$ & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^3$ & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^4$ & > $10.0$ s & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^5$ & > $10.0$ s & $5.3$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^6$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^7$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    The comparison shows that all algorithms\n    are efficient when the input size is small,\n    but larger inputs bring out remarkable\n    differences in the running times of the algorithms.\n    Algorithm 1 becomes slow\n    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2\n    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.\n    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process\n    even the largest inputs instantly.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
