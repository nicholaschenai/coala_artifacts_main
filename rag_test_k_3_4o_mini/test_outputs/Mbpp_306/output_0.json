We will maintain an array that keeps track of the maximum sum of increasing subsequences that end at each index. We will iterate through the list up to index `i`, updating our maximum sums, and then we will include the element at index `k` if it can extend any of the subsequences we have calculated.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n       if k <= i:\n           return 0  // Invalid case, k must be greater than i\n       \n       // Create an array to store the maximum sums\n       max_sum = [0] * n\n       \n       // Calculate maximum sums for increasing subsequences up to index i\n       for j from 0 to i-1:\n           max_sum[j] = arr[j]  // Each element can be a subsequence by itself\n           for m from 0 to j-1:\n               if arr[m] < arr[j]:\n                   max_sum[j] = max(max_sum[j], max_sum[m] + arr[j])\n       \n       // Now include the element at index k\n       max_result = 0\n       for j from 0 to i-1:\n           if arr[j] < arr[k]:\n               max_result = max(max_result, max_sum[j] + arr[k])\n       \n       return max_result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n    # Check if k is valid\n    if k <= i:\n        return 0  # Invalid case, k must be greater than i\n    \n    # Create an array to store the maximum sums\n    max_sum = [0] * n\n    \n    # Calculate maximum sums for increasing subsequences up to index i\n    for j in range(i):\n        max_sum[j] = arr[j]  # Each element can be a subsequence by itself\n        for m in range(j):\n            if arr[m] < arr[j]:\n                max_sum[j] = max(max_sum[j], max_sum[m] + arr[j])\n    \n    # Now include the element at index k\n    max_result = 0\n    for j in range(i):\n        if arr[j] < arr[k]:\n            max_result = max(max_result, max_sum[j] + arr[k])\n    \n    return max_result\n```",
