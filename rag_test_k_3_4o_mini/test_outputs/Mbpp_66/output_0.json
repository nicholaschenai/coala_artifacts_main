    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that counts how many positive numbers are present in a given list of integers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the list and check if it is greater than zero. We will maintain a count of how many such positive numbers we find. At the end of the iteration, we will return this count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function pos_count(numbers):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is greater than 0:\n               increment count by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_positive(numbers):\n    # Initialize a counter for positive numbers\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is positive\n        if number > 0:\n            # Increment the count if the number is positive\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of positive numbers\n    return count\n\ndef pos_count(numbers: list[int]) -> int:\n    return count_positive(numbers)\n```",
