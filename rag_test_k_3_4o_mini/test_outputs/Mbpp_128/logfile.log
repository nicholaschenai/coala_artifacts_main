INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/128 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a number `n` and a string of words. The function should return a list of words from that string that are longer than `n` characters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - First, we will split the input string into individual words.
   - Then, we will check the length of each word.
   - If a word's length is greater than `n`, we will add it to a new list.
   - Finally, we will return the list of words that are longer than `n` characters.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function long_words(n, words_string):
       split the words_string into a list of words
       create an empty list to hold long words
       for each word in the list of words:
           if the length of the word is greater than n:
               add the word to the list of long words
       return the list of long words
   ```

    Let $\texttt{length}(k)$ denote
    the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position $k$.
    Thus, if we calculate all values of
    $\texttt{length}(k)$ where $0 \le k \le n-1$,
    we will find out the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence.
    For example, the values of the function
    for the above array are as follows:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{length}(0) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(4) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{length}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(6) & = & 4 \\
    \texttt{length}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{length}(6)=4$,
    because the longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position 6 consists of 4 elements.

    To calculate a value of $\texttt{length}(k)$,
    we should find a position $i<k$
    for which $\texttt{array}[i]<\texttt{array}[k]$
    and $\texttt{length}(i)$ is as large as possible.
    Then we know that
    $\texttt{length}(k)=\texttt{length}(i)+1$,
    because this is an optimal way to add
    $\texttt{array}[k]$ to a subsequence.
    However, if there is no such position $i$,
    then $\texttt{length}(k)=1$,
    which means that the subsequence only contains
    $\texttt{array}[k]$.

    Since all values of the function can be calculated
    from its smaller values,
    we can use dynamic programming.
    In the following code, the values
    of the function will be stored in an array
    $\texttt{length}$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        length[k] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (array[i] < array[k]) {
                length[k] = max(length[k],length[i]+1);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    This code works in $O(n^2)$ time,
    because it consists of two nested loops.
    However, it is also possible to implement
    the dynamic programming calculation
    more efficiently in $O(n \log n)$ time.
    Can you find a way to do this?

    Title: Longest increasing subsequence
    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of words and an integer `n`, and returns a list of words that are longer than `n` characters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will iterate through the list of words.
   - For each word, we will check its length.
   - If the length of the word is greater than `n`, we will add it to a new list.
   - Finally, we will return the new list containing all the words that are longer than `n` characters.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function long_words(n, words):
       create an empty list called result
       for each word in words:
           if length of word is greater than n:
               add word to result
       return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def long_words(n: int, words: str) -> list:
    # Split the input string into a list of words
    word_list = words.split()
    # Create an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    # Iterate through each word in the list
    for word in word_list:
        # Check if the length of the word is greater than n
        if len(word) > n:
            # If true, add the word to the result list
            result.append(word)
    # Return the list of words that are longer than n characters
    return result
```
