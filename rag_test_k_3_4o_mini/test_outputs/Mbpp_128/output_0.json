    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of words and an integer `n`, and returns a list of words that are longer than `n` characters.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the list of words.\n   - For each word, we will check its length.\n   - If the length of the word is greater than `n`, we will add it to a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return the new list containing all the words that are longer than `n` characters.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function long_words(n, words):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for each word in words:\n           if length of word is greater than n:\n               add word to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef long_words(n: int, words: str) -> list:\n    # Split the input string into a list of words\n    word_list = words.split()\n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    # Iterate through each word in the list\n    for word in word_list:\n        # Check if the length of the word is greater than n\n        if len(word) > n:\n            # If true, add the word to the result list\n            result.append(word)\n    # Return the list of words that are longer than n characters\n    return result\n```",
