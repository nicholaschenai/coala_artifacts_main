This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):\n    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:\n\n    $$N_0 = \\binom{25}{5}$$\n\n    We will now calculate the number of \"bad\" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The \"bad\" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.\n\n    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \\ge 9$, and all other $x_i \\ge 0 ~ (i \\ne k)$ (they may be $\\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:\n\n    $$ | A_k | = \\binom{16}{5} $$\n\n    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \\ne p$) is equal to:\n\n    $$ \\left| A_k \\cap A_p \\right| = \\binom{7}{5}$$\n\n    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.\n\n    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:\n\n    $$\\binom{25}{5} - \\left(\\binom{6}{1} \\cdot \\binom{16}{5} - \\binom{6}{2} \\cdot \\binom{7}{5}\\right) $$\n\n    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval\n\n    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).\n\n    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.\n\n    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\\cdots k)$.\n\n    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:\n\n    $$ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{ r }{ p_i } \\right\\rfloor $$\n\n    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.\n\n    Here is a C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int solve (int n, int r) {\n    \tvector<int> p;\n    \tfor (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)\n    \t\tif (n % i == 0) {\n    \t\t\tp.push_back (i);\n    \t\t\twhile (n % i == 0)\n    \t\t\t\tn /= i;\n    \t\t}\n    \tif (n > 1)\n    \t\tp.push_back (n);\n\n    \tint sum = 0;\n    \tfor (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {\n    \t\tint mult = 1,\n    \t\t\tbits = 0;\n    \t\tfor (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)\n    \t\t\tif (msk & (1<<i)) {\n    \t\t\t\t++bits;\n    \t\t\t\tmult *= p[i];\n    \t\t\t}\n\n    \t\tint cur = r / mult;\n    \t\tif (bits % 2 == 1)\n    \t\t\tsum += cur;\n    \t\telse\n    \t\t\tsum -= cur;\n    \t}\n\n    \treturn r - sum;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Bit manipulation\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Bit manipulation\n\n    ## Binary number\n\n    A **binary number** is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, it is a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically \"0\" (zero) and \"1\" (one).\n\n    We say that a certain bit is **set**, if it is one, and **cleared** if it is zero.\n\n    The binary number $(a_k a_{k-1} \\dots a_1 a_0)_2$ represents the number:\n\n    $$(a_k a_{k-1} \\dots a_1 a_0)_2 = a_k \\cdot 2^k + a_{k-1} \\cdot 2^{k-1} + \\dots + a_1 \\cdot 2^1 + a_0 \\cdot 2^0.$$\n\n    For instance the binary number $1101_2$ represents the number $13$:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    1101_2 &= 1 \\cdot 2^3 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 0 \\cdot 2^1 + 1 \\cdot 2^0 \\\\\n           &= 1\\cdot 8 + 1 \\cdot 4 + 0 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 13\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    Computers represent integers as binary numbers.\n    Positive integers (both signed and unsigned) are just represented with their binary digits, and negative signed numbers (which can be positive and negative) are usually represented with the [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).\n\n    ```cpp\n    unsigned int unsigned_number = 13;\n    assert(unsigned_number == 0b1101);\n\n    int positive_signed_number = 13;\n    assert(positive_signed_number == 0b1101);\n\n    int negative_signed_number = -13;\n    assert(negative_signed_number == 0b1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'0011);\n    ```\n\n    CPUs are very fast manipulating those bits with specific operations.\n    For some problems we can take these binary number representations to our advantage, and speed up the execution time.\n    And for some problems (typically in combinatorics or dynamic programming) where we want to track which objects we already picked from a given set of objects, we can just use an large enough integer where each digit represents an object and depending on if we pick or drop the object we set or clear the digit.\n\n    ## Bit operators\n\n    All those introduced operators are instant (same speed as an addition) on a CPU for fixed-length integers.\n\n    ### Bitwise operators\n\n    -   $\\&$ : The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand. \n        If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n \t\n    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.\n\n    Examples:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 01010000\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n | (n-1) = 01011111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    --------------------\n    ~n        = 10100111\n    ```\n\n    ### Shift operators\n\n    There are two operators for shifting bits.\n\n    -   $\\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.\n        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\gg 2 = 101_2 \\gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\\frac{5}{2^2} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1$.\n        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.\n\n    -   $\\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.\n        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\ll 3 = 101_2 \\ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \\cdot 2^3 = 5 \\cdot 8 = 40$.\n\n        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.\n\n\n    ## Useful tricks\n\n    ### Set/flip/clear a bit\n\n    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.\n    $1 \\ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\\sim(1 \\ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.\n\n    - $n ~|~ (1 \\ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\wedge~ (1 \\ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\&~ \\sim(1 \\ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n\n    ### Check if a bit is set\n\n    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {\n        return (number >> x) & 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2\n\n    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).\n    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.\n    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {\n        return n && !(n & (n - 1));\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Clear the most-right set bit\n\n    The expression $n ~\\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.\n    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.\n    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.\n\n    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 00110100\n    n-1       = 00110011\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 00110000\n    ```\n\n    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm\n\n    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.\n\n    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    int countSetBits(int n)\n    {\n        int count = 0;\n        while (n)\n        {\n            n = n & (n - 1);\n            count++;\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Data structures\n    Section: Comparison to sorting\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Comparison to sorting}\n\n    It is often possible to solve a problem\n    using either data structures or sorting.\n    Sometimes there are remarkable differences\n    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,\n    which may be hidden in their time complexities.\n\n    Let us consider a problem where\n    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$\n    that both contain $n$ elements.\n    Our task is to calculate the number of elements\n    that belong to both of the lists.\n    For example, for the lists\n    \\[A = [5,2,8,9] \\hspace{10px} \\textrm{and} \\hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\\]\n    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5\n    and 9 belong to both of the lists.\n\n    A straightforward solution to the problem is\n    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,\n    but next we will focus on\n    more efficient algorithms.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,\n    and after this, we iterate through the elements\n    of $B$ and check for each elements if it\n    also belongs to $A$.\n    This is efficient because the elements of $A$\n    are in a set.\n    Using the \\texttt{set} structure,\n    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,\n    so instead of the \\texttt{set} structure\n    we can also use the \\texttt{unordered\\_set} structure.\n    This is an easy way to make the algorithm\n    more efficient, because we only have to change\n    the underlying data structure.\n    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 3}\n\n    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.\n    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.\n    After this, we iterate through both the lists\n    at the same time and find the common elements.\n    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,\n    so the total time complexity is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    The following table shows how efficient\n    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and\n    the elements of the lists are random\n    integers between $1 \\ldots 10^9$:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\\\\n    $2 \\cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\\\\n    $3 \\cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\\\\n    $4 \\cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\\\\n    $5 \\cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that\n    they use different set structures.\n    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on\n    the running time, because Algorithm 2\n    is 4\u20135 times faster than Algorithm 1.\n\n    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3\n    which uses sorting.\n    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.\n    Interestingly, the time complexity of both\n    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.\n    This can be explained by the fact that\n    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done\n    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.\n    On the other hand,\n    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree\n    during the whole algorithm.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
