INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/252 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that converts a complex number into its polar coordinates. The polar coordinates consist of a radius (magnitude) and an angle (phase) in radians. The function should take a complex number as input and return a tuple containing these two values.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert a complex number to polar coordinates, we can use the following formulas:
   - The radius (magnitude) can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
     \]
     where \(a\) is the real part and \(b\) is the imaginary part of the complex number.
   - The angle (phase) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \theta = \text{atan2}(b, a)
     \]
     This function computes the angle in radians based on the signs of both \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function convert(complex_number):
       a = real part of complex_number
       b = imaginary part of complex_number
       radius = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
       angle = atan2(b, a)
       return (radius, angle)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python

# Function to convert a complex number to polar coordinates
def convert(complex_number):
    # Extract the real and imaginary parts
    a = complex_number.real

    # Calculate the radius (magnitude)
    radius = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle (phase) in radians
    angle = math.atan2(b, a)
    
    # Return the polar coordinates as a tuple
    return (radius, angle)

    Chapter: Geometry
    Section: Complex numbers
    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{Geometry}

    \index{geometry}

    In geometric problems, it is often challenging
    to find a way to approach the problem so that
    the solution to the problem can be conveniently implemented
    and the number of special cases is small.

    As an example, consider a problem where
    we are given the vertices of a quadrilateral
    (a polygon that has four vertices),
    and our task is to calculate its area.
    For example, a possible input for the problem is as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]

    \draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (5,6) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[thick] (6,2) -- (5,6) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    One way to approach the problem is to divide
    the quadrilateral into two triangles by a straight
    line between two opposite vertices:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]

    \draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (5,6) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];

    \draw[thick] (6,2) -- (5,6) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);
    \draw[dashed,thick] (2,5) -- (6,2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    After this, it suffices to sum the areas
    of the triangles.
    The area of a triangle can be calculated,
    for example, using \key{Heron's formula}
    %\footnote{Heron of Alexandria (c. 10--70) was a Greek mathematician.}
    \[ \sqrt{s (s-a) (s-b) (s-c)},\]
    where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are the lengths
    of the triangle's sides and
    $s=(a+b+c)/2$.
    \index{Heron's formula}

    This is a possible way to solve the problem,
    but there is one pitfall:
    how to divide the quadrilateral into triangles?
    It turns out that sometimes we cannot just pick
    two arbitrary opposite vertices.
    For example, in the following situation,
    the division line is \emph{outside} the quadrilateral:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]

    \draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (3,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[thick] (6,2) -- (3,2) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);

    \draw[dashed,thick] (2,5) -- (6,2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    However, another way to draw the line works:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]

    \draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (3,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[thick] (6,2) -- (3,2) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);

    \draw[dashed,thick] (3,2) -- (1,1);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    It is clear for a human which of the lines is the correct
    choice, but the situation is difficult for a computer.
                           
    However, it turns out that we can solve the problem using
    another method that is more convenient to a programmer.
    Namely, there is a general formula
    \[x_1y_2-x_2y_1+x_2y_3-x_3y_2+x_3y_4-x_4y_3+x_4y_1-x_1y_4,\]
    that calculates the area of a quadrilateral
    whose vertices are
    $(x_1,y_1)$,
    $(x_2,y_2)$,
    $(x_3,y_3)$ and
    $(x_4,y_4)$.
    This formula is easy to implement, there are no special
    cases, and we can even generalize the formula
    to \emph{all} polygons.

    \section{Complex numbers}

    \index{complex number}
    \index{point}
    \index{vector}

    A \key{complex number} is a number of the form $x+y i$,
    where $i = \sqrt{-1}$ is the \key{imaginary unit}.
    A geometric interpretation of a complex number is
    that it represents a two-dimensional point $(x,y)$
    or a vector from the origin to a point $(x,y)$.

    For example, $4+2i$ corresponds to the
    following point and vector:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]

    \draw[->,thick] (-5,0)--(5,0);
    \draw[->,thick] (0,-5)--(0,5);

    \draw[fill] (4,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[->,thick] (0,0)--(4-0.1,2-0.1);

    \node at (4,2.8) {$(4,2)$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \index{complex@\texttt{complex}}

    The C++ complex number class \texttt{complex} is
    useful when solving geometric problems.
    Using the class we can represent points and vectors
    as complex numbers, and the class contains tools
    that are useful in geometry.

    In the following code, \texttt{C} is the type of
    a coordinate and \texttt{P} is the type of a point or a vector.
    In addition, the code defines macros \texttt{X} and \texttt{Y}
    that can be used to refer to x and y coordinates.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    typedef long long C;
    typedef complex<C> P;
    #define X real()
    #define Y imag()
    \end{lstlisting}

    For example, the following code defines a point $p=(4,2)$
    and prints its x and y coordinates:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    P p = {4,2};
    cout << p.X << " " << p.Y << "\n"; // 4 2
    \end{lstlisting}

    The following code defines vectors $v=(3,1)$ and $u=(2,2)$,
    and after that calculates the sum $s=v+u$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    P v = {3,1};
    P u = {2,2};
    P s = v+u;
    cout << s.X << " " << s.Y << "\n"; // 5 3
    \end{lstlisting}

    In practice,
    an appropriate coordinate type is usually
    \texttt{long long} (integer) or \texttt{long double}
    (real number).
    It is a good idea to use integer whenever possible,
    because calculations with integers are exact.
    If real numbers are needed,
    precision errors should be taken into account
    when comparing numbers.
    A safe way to check if real numbers $a$ and $b$ are equal
    is to compare them using $|a-b|<\epsilon$,
    where $\epsilon$ is a small number (for example, $\epsilon=10^{-9}$).

    \subsubsection*{Functions}

    In the following examples, the coordinate type is
    \texttt{long double}.

    The function $\texttt{abs}(v)$ calculates the length
    $|v|$ of a vector $v=(x,y)$
    using the formula $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.
    The function can also be used for
    calculating the distance between points
    $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$,
    because that distance equals the length
    of the vector $(x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1)$.

    The following code calculates the distance
    between points $(4,2)$ and $(3,-1)$:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    P a = {4,2};
    P b = {3,-1};
    cout << abs(b-a) << "\n"; // 3.16228
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function $\texttt{arg}(v)$ calculates the
    angle of a vector $v=(x,y)$ with respect to the x axis.
    The function gives the angle in radians,
    where $r$ radians equals $180 r/\pi$ degrees.
    The angle of a vector that points to the right is 0,
    and angles decrease clockwise and increase
    counterclockwise.

    The function $\texttt{polar}(s,a)$ constructs a vector
    whose length is $s$ and that points to an angle $a$.
    A vector can be rotated by an angle $a$
    by multiplying it by a vector with length 1 and angle $a$.

    The following code calculates the angle of
    the vector $(4,2)$, rotates it $1/2$ radians
    counterclockwise, and then calculates the angle again:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    P v = {4,2};
    cout << arg(v) << "\n"; // 0.463648
    v *= polar(1.0,0.5);
    cout << arg(v) << "\n"; // 0.963648
    \end{lstlisting}

        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\frac{x+y \sqrt{n}}{z}$.

    !!! example "[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)"
        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

   - The radius (magnitude) can be calculated using the formula: \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), where \( x \) is the real part and \( y \) is the imaginary part of the complex number.
   - The angle (argument) can be calculated using the formula: \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \), which gives the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point \( (x, y) \).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function convert(complex_number):
       x = real part of complex_number
       y = imaginary part of complex_number
       radius = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
       angle = atan2(y, x)
       return (radius, angle)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
import math

# Function to calculate the radius and angle of a complex number
def polar_coordinates(complex_number):
    # Extract the real and imaginary parts
    x = complex_number.real
    y = complex_number.imag
    
    # Calculate the radius (magnitude)
    radius = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle (argument) in radians
    angle = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Return the radius and angle as a tuple
    return (radius, angle)

# Function to convert a complex number to polar coordinates
def convert(complex_number):
    return polar_coordinates(complex_number)
```
