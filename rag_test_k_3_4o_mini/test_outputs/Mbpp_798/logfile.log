   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers (an array) as input and returns the total sum of those numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the sum of the numbers in the list, we can initialize a variable to hold the total sum, iterate through each number in the list, and add each number to the total sum. Finally, we will return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function _sum(array):

       for each number in array:
           add number to total_sum
       return total_sum

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 1/2
    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum

    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).

    ## Problem statement

    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:

    $$ \max_{ 1 \le l \le r \le n } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.
    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.

    ## Algorithm 1

    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm is very simple.

    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.

    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.

    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.

    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.

    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.

    ### Implementation

    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ â€” we will only need the current element from it.

    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.

    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);
        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);
    }
    ```

    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        int cur = sum - min_sum;
        if (cur > ans) {
            ans = cur;
            ans_l = min_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = sum;
            min_pos = r;
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Algorithm 2

    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.

    **Proof:**

    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum â€” so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.

    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.

    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a "critical" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.

    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.

    ### Implementation

    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum);
        sum = max(sum, 0);
    }
    ```

    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        if (sum > ans) {
            ans = sum;
            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < 0) {
            sum = 0;
            minus_pos = r;
        }
    }

    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.

    Part: 1/2
    \section{Mathematics}

    Mathematics plays an important role in competitive
    programming, and it is not possible to become
    a successful competitive programmer without
    having good mathematical skills.
    This section discusses some important
    mathematical concepts and formulas that
    are needed later in the book.

    \subsubsection{Sum formulas}

    Each sum of the form
    \[\sum_{x=1}^n x^k = 1^k+2^k+3^k+\ldots+n^k,\]
    where $k$ is a positive integer,
    has a closed-form formula that is a
    polynomial of degree $k+1$.
    For example\footnote{\index{Faulhaber's formula}
    There is even a general formula for such sums, called \key{Faulhaber's formula},
    but it is too complex to be presented here.},
    \[\sum_{x=1}^n x = 1+2+3+\ldots+n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\]
    and
    \[\sum_{x=1}^n x^2 = 1^2+2^2+3^2+\ldots+n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.\]

    An \key{arithmetic progression} is a \index{arithmetic progression}
    sequence of numbers
    where the difference between any two consecutive
    numbers is constant.
    For example,
    \[3, 7, 11, 15\]
    is an arithmetic progression with constant 4.
    The sum of an arithmetic progression can be calculated
    using the formula
    \[\underbrace{a + \cdots + b}_{n \,\, \textrm{numbers}} = \frac{n(a+b)}{2}\]
    where $a$ is the first number,
    $b$ is the last number and
    $n$ is the amount of numbers.
    For example,
    \[3+7+11+15=\frac{4 \cdot (3+15)}{2} = 36.\]
    The formula is based on the fact
    that the sum consists of $n$ numbers and
    the value of each number is $(a+b)/2$ on average.

    \index{geometric progression}
    A \key{geometric progression} is a sequence
    of numbers
    where the ratio between any two consecutive
    numbers is constant.
    For example,
    \[3,6,12,24\]
    is a geometric progression with constant 2.
    The sum of a geometric progression can be calculated
    using the formula
    \[a + ak + ak^2 + \cdots + b = \frac{bk-a}{k-1}\]
    where $a$ is the first number,
    $b$ is the last number and the
    ratio between consecutive numbers is $k$.
    For example,
    \[3+6+12+24=\frac{24 \cdot 2 - 3}{2-1} = 45.\]

    This formula can be derived as follows. Let
    \[ S = a + ak + ak^2 + \cdots + b .\]
    By multiplying both sides by $k$, we get
    \[ kS = ak + ak^2 + ak^3 + \cdots + bk,\]
    and solving the equation
    \[ kS-S = bk-a\]
    yields the formula.

    A special case of a sum of a geometric progression is the formula
    \[1+2+4+8+\ldots+2^{n-1}=2^n-1.\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    A \key{harmonic sum} is a sum of the form
    \[ \sum_{x=1}^n \frac{1}{x} = 1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\ldots+\frac{1}{n}.\]

    An upper bound for a harmonic sum is $\log_2(n)+1$.
    Namely, we can
    modify each term $1/k$ so that $k$ becomes
    the nearest power of two that does not exceed $k$.
    For example, when $n=6$, we can estimate
    the sum as follows:
    \[ 1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{6} \le
    1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}.\]
    This upper bound consists of $\log_2(n)+1$ parts
    ($1$, $2 \cdot 1/2$, $4 \cdot 1/4$, etc.),
    and the value of each part is at most 1.

    \subsubsection{Set theory}

    \index{set theory}
    \index{set}
    \index{intersection}
    \index{union}
    \index{difference}
    \index{subset}
    \index{universal set}
    \index{complement}

    A \key{set} is a collection of elements.
    For example, the set
    \[X=\{2,4,7\}\]
    contains elements 2, 4 and 7.
    The symbol $\emptyset$ denotes an empty set,
    and $|S|$ denotes the size of a set $S$,
    i.e., the number of elements in the set.
    For example, in the above set, $|X|=3$.

    If a set $S$ contains an element $x$,
    we write $x \in S$,
    and otherwise we write $x \notin S$.
    For example, in the above set
    \[4 \in X \hspace{10px}\textrm{and}\hspace{10px} 5 \notin X.\]

    \begin{samepage}
    New sets can be constructed using set operations:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The \key{intersection} $A \cap B$ consists of elements
    that are in both $A$ and $B$.
    For example, if $A=\{1,2,5\}$ and $B=\{2,4\}$,
    then $A \cap B = \{2\}$.
    \item The \key{union} $A \cup B$ consists of elements
    that are in $A$ or $B$ or both.
    For example, if $A=\{3,7\}$ and $B=\{2,3,8\}$,
    then $A \cup B = \{2,3,7,8\}$.
    \item The \key{complement} $\bar A$ consists of elements
    that are not in $A$.
    The interpretation of a complement depends on
    the \key{universal set}, which contains all possible elements.
    For example, if $A=\{1,2,5,7\}$ and the universal set is
    $\{1,2,\ldots,10\}$, then $\bar A = \{3,4,6,8,9,10\}$.
    \item The \key{difference} $A \setminus B = A \cap \bar B$
    consists of elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.
    Note that $B$ can contain elements that are not in $A$.
    For example, if $A=\{2,3,7,8\}$ and $B=\{3,5,8\}$,
    then $A \setminus B = \{2,7\}$.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{samepage}

    If each element of $A$ also belongs to $S$,
    we say that $A$ is a \key{subset} of $S$,
    denoted by $A \subset S$.
    A set $S$ always has $2^{|S|}$ subsets,
    including the empty set.
    For example, the subsets of the set $\{2,4,7\}$ are
    \begin{center}
    $\emptyset$,
    $\{2\}$, $\{4\}$, $\{7\}$, $\{2,4\}$, $\{2,7\}$, $\{4,7\}$ and $\{2,4,7\}$.
    \end{center}

    Some often used sets are
    $\mathbb{N}$ (natural numbers),
    $\mathbb{Z}$ (integers),
    $\mathbb{Q}$ (rational numbers) and
    $\mathbb{R}$ (real numbers).
    The set $\mathbb{N}$
    can be defined in two ways, depending
    on the situation:
    either $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$
    or $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,...\}$.

    We can also construct a set using a rule of the form
    \[\{f(n) : n \in S\},\]
    where $f(n)$ is some function.
    This set contains all elements of the form $f(n)$,
    where $n$ is an element in $S$.
    For example, the set
    \[X=\{2n : n \in \mathbb{Z}\}\]
    contains all even integers.

    \subsubsection{Logic}

    \index{logic}
    \index{negation}
    \index{conjuction}
    \index{disjunction}
    \index{implication}
    \index{equivalence}

    The value of a logical expression is either
    \key{true} (1) or \key{false} (0).
    The most important logical operators are
    $\lnot$ (\key{negation}),
    $\land$ (\key{conjunction}),
    $\lor$ (\key{disjunction}),
    $\Rightarrow$ (\key{implication}) and
    $\Leftrightarrow$ (\key{equivalence}).
    The following table shows the meanings of these operators:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rr|rrrrrrr}
    $A$ & $B$ & $\lnot A$ & $\lnot B$ & $A \land B$ & $A \lor B$ & $A \Rightarrow B$ & $A \Leftrightarrow B$ \\
    \hline
    0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    The expression $\lnot A$ has the opposite value of $A$.
    The expression $A \land B$ is true if both $A$ and $B$
    are true,
    and the expression $A \lor B$ is true if $A$ or $B$ or both
    are true.
    The expression $A \Rightarrow B$ is true
    if whenever $A$ is true, also $B$ is true.
    The expression $A \Leftrightarrow B$ is true
    if $A$ and $B$ are both true or both false.

    \index{predicate}

    A \key{predicate} is an expression that is true or false
    depending on its parameters.
    Predicates are usually denoted by capital letters.
    For example, we can define a predicate $P(x)$
    that is true exactly when $x$ is a prime number.
    Using this definition, $P(7)$ is true but $P(8)$ is false.

    \index{quantifier}

    A \key{quantifier} connects a logical expression
    to the elements of a set.
    The most important quantifiers are
    $\forall$ (\key{for all}) and $\exists$ (\key{there is}).
    For example,
    \[\forall x (\exists y (y < x))\]
    means that for each element $x$ in the set,
    there is an element $y$ in the set
    such that $y$ is smaller than $x$.
    This is true in the set of integers,
    but false in the set of natural numbers.

    Using the notation described above,
    we can express many kinds of logical propositions.
    For example,
    \[\forall x ((x>1 \land \lnot P(x)) \Rightarrow (\exists a (\exists b (a > 1 \land b > 1 \land x = ab))))\]
    means that if a number $x$ is larger than 1
    and not a prime number,
    then there are numbers $a$ and $b$
    that are larger than $1$ and whose product is $x$.
    This proposition is true in the set of integers.

    \subsubsection{Functions}

    The function $\lfloor x \rfloor$ rounds the number $x$
    down to an integer, and the function
    $\lceil x \rceil$ rounds the number $x

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/798 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a Python function that takes a list of numbers (an array) as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the sum of the numbers in the array, we can initialize a variable to hold the sum (starting at zero). We will then iterate through each number in the array, adding each number to the sum variable. Finally, we will return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function _sum(array):
       initialize sum to 0
       for each number in array:
           add number to sum
       return sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a helper function to calculate the sum of an array
def calculate_sum(arr):
    total = 0  # Initialize the sum to 0
    for number in arr:  # Iterate through each number in the array
        total += number  # Add the current number to the total
    return total  # Return the total sum

# Define the main function that will be called
def _sum(arr: list[int]) -> int:
    return calculate_sum(arr)  # Call the helper function and return its result
