INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/111 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (nested lists) and finds the elements that are common across all the inner lists. The output should be a list of these common elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the common elements in the nested lists, we can start by taking the first inner list as a reference. We will then check each element in this reference list to see if it exists in all the other inner lists. If an element is found in all lists, we will add it to our result list. Finally, we will return the list of common elements.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
       if nested_lists is empty:
           return empty list
       
       initialize common_elements as an empty list
       take the first inner list as reference_list
       
       for each element in reference_list:
           set is_common to true
           for each inner_list in nested_lists:
               if element is not in inner_list:
                   set is_common to false
                   break
           if is_common is true:
               add element to common_elements
       
       return common_elements
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
    # Check if the input list is empty
    if not nested_lists:
        return []
    
    # Initialize a list to hold common elements
    common_elements = []
    
    # Take the first inner list as the reference list
    reference_list = nested_lists[0]
    
    # Iterate through each element in the reference list
    for element in reference_list:
        is_common = True  # Assume the element is common
        
        # Check if the element is present in all other inner lists
        for inner_list in nested_lists:
            if element not in inner_list:
                is_common = False  # Element is not common
                break  # No need to check further
        
        # If the element is common, add it to the common_elements list
        if is_common:
            common_elements.append(element)
    
    # Return the list of common elements
    return common_elements

    Chapter: Complete search
    Section: Meet in the middle
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Meet in the middle}

    \index{meet in the middle}

    \key{Meet in the middle} is a technique
    where the search space is divided into
    two parts of about equal size.
    A separate search is performed
    for both of the parts,
    and finally the results of the searches are combined.

    The technique can be used
    if there is an efficient way to combine the
    results of the searches.
    In such a situation, the two searches may require less
    time than one large search.
    Typically, we can turn a factor of $2^n$
    into a factor of $2^{n/2}$ using the meet in the
    middle technique.

    As an example, consider a problem where
    we are given a list of $n$ numbers and
    a number $x$,
    and we want to find out if it is possible
    to choose some numbers from the list so that
    their sum is $x$.
    For example, given the list $[2,4,5,9]$ and $x=15$,
    we can choose the numbers $[2,4,9]$ to get $2+4+9=15$.
    However, if $x=10$ for the same list,
    it is not possible to form the sum.

    A simple algorithm to the problem is to
    go through all subsets of the elements and
    check if the sum of any of the subsets is $x$.
    The running time of such an algorithm is $O(2^n)$,
    because there are $2^n$ subsets.
    However, using the meet in the middle technique,
    we can achieve a more efficient $O(2^{n/2})$ time algorithm\footnote{This
    idea was introduced in 1974 by E. Horowitz and S. Sahni \cite{hor74}.}.
    Note that $O(2^n)$ and $O(2^{n/2})$ are different
    complexities because $2^{n/2}$ equals $\sqrt{2^n}$.

    The idea is to divide the list into
    two lists $A$ and $B$ such that both
    lists contain about half of the numbers.
    The first search generates all subsets
    of $A$ and stores their sums to a list $S_A$.
    Correspondingly, the second search creates
    a list $S_B$ from $B$.
    After this, it suffices to check if it is possible
    to choose one element from $S_A$ and another
    element from $S_B$ such that their sum is $x$.
    This is possible exactly when there is a way to
    form the sum $x$ using the numbers of the original list.

    For example, suppose that the list is $[2,4,5,9]$ and $x=15$.
    First, we divide the list into $A=[2,4]$ and $B=[5,9]$.
    After this, we create lists
    $S_A=[0,2,4,6]$ and $S_B=[0,5,9,14]$.
    In this case, the sum $x=15$ is possible to form,
    because $S_A$ contains the sum $6$,
    $S_B$ contains the sum $9$, and $6+9=15$.
    This corresponds to the solution $[2,4,9]$.

    We can implement the algorithm so that
    its time complexity is $O(2^{n/2})$.
    First, we generate \emph{sorted} lists $S_A$ and $S_B$,
    which can be done in $O(2^{n/2})$ time using a merge-like technique.
    After this, since the lists are sorted,
    we can check in $O(2^{n/2})$ time if
    the sum $x$ can be created from $S_A$ and $S_B$.

    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{Complete search}

    \key{Complete search}
    is a general method that can be used
    to solve almost any algorithm problem.
    The idea is to generate all possible
    solutions to the problem using brute force,
    and then select the best solution or count the
    number of solutions, depending on the problem.

    Complete search is a good technique
    if there is enough time to go through all the solutions,
    because the search is usually easy to implement
    and it always gives the correct answer.
    If complete search is too slow,
    other techniques, such as greedy algorithms or
    dynamic programming, may be needed.

    \section{Generating subsets}

    \index{subset}

    We first consider the problem of generating
    all subsets of a set of $n$ elements.
    For example, the subsets of $\{0,1,2\}$ are
    $\emptyset$, $\{0\}$, $\{1\}$, $\{2\}$, $\{0,1\}$,
    $\{0,2\}$, $\{1,2\}$ and $\{0,1,2\}$.
    There are two common methods to generate subsets:
    we can either perform a recursive search
    or exploit the bit representation of integers.

    \subsubsection{Method 1}

    An elegant way to go through all subsets
    of a set is to use recursion.
    The following function \texttt{search}
    generates the subsets of the set
    $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$.
    The function maintains a vector \texttt{subset}
    that will contain the elements of each subset.
    The search begins when the function is called
    with parameter 0.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    void search(int k) {
        if (k == n) {
            // process subset
        } else {
            search(k+1);
            subset.push_back(k);
            search(k+1);
            subset.pop_back();
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    When the function \texttt{search}
    is called with parameter $k$,
    it decides whether to include the
    element $k$ in the subset or not,
    and in both cases,
    then calls itself with parameter $k+1$
    However, if $k=n$, the function notices that
    all elements have been processed
    and a subset has been generated.

    The following tree illustrates the function calls when $n=3$.
    We can always choose either the left branch
    ($k$ is not included in the subset) or the right branch
    ($k$ is included in the subset).

        \path[draw,thick,->] (12,-8-0.5) -- (14,-12+0.5);
    \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Method 2}

    Another way to generate subsets is based on
    the bit representation of integers.
    Each subset of a set of $n$ elements
    can be represented as a sequence of $n$ bits,
    which corresponds to an integer between $0 \ldots 2^n-1$.
    The ones in the bit sequence indicate
    which elements are included in the subset.

    The usual convention is that
    the last bit corresponds to element 0,
    the second last bit corresponds to element 1,
    and so on.
    For example, the bit representation of 25
    is 11001, which corresponds to the subset $\{0,3,4\}$.

    The following code goes through the subsets
    of a set of $n$ elements

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int b = 0; b < (1<<n); b++) {
        // process subset
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The following code shows how we can find
    the elements of a subset that corresponds to a bit sequence.
    When processing each subset,
    the code builds a vector that contains the
    elements in the subset.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int b = 0; b < (1<<n); b++) {
        vector<int> subset;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (b&(1<<i)) subset.push_back(i);
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 3/5
    ```

    Asymptotics of the solution is $O (\sqrt{n})$.

    ### The number of integers in a given interval which are multiple of at least one of the given numbers

    Given $n$ numbers $a_i$ and number $r$. You want to count the number of integers in the interval $[1; r]$ that are multiple of at least one of the $a_i$.

    The solution algorithm is almost identical to the one for previous task — construct the formula of inclusion-exclusion on the numbers $a_i$, i.e. each term in this formula is the number of numbers divisible by a given subset of numbers $a_i$ (in other words, divisible by their [least common multiple](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md)).

    So we will now iterate over all $2^n$ subsets of integers $a_i$ with $O(n \log r)$ operations to find their least common multiple, adding or subtracting the number of multiples of it in the interval. Asymptotics is $O (2^n\cdot n\cdot \log r)$.

    ### The number of strings that satisfy a given pattern

    Consider $n$ patterns of strings of the same length, consisting only of letters ($a...z$) or question marks. You're also given a number $k$. A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. The task is to count the number of strings that match exactly $k$ of the patterns (first problem) and at least $k$ of the patterns (second problem).

    Notice first that we can easily count the number of strings that satisfy at once all of the specified patterns. To do this, simply "cross" patterns: iterate though the positions ("slots") and look at a position over all patterns. If all patterns have a question mark in this position, the character can be any letter from $a$ to $z$. Otherwise, the character of this position is uniquely defined by the patterns that do not contain a question mark.

    Learn now to solve the first version of the problem: when the string must satisfy exactly $k$ of the patterns.

    To solve it, iterate and fix a specific subset $X$ from the set of patterns consisting of $k$ patterns. Then we have to count the number of strings that satisfy this set of patterns, and only matches it, that is, they don't match any other pattern. We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a slightly different manner: we sum on all supersets $Y$ (subsets from the original set of strings that contain $X$), and either add to the current answer or subtract it from the number of strings:

    $$ ans(X) = \sum_{Y \supseteq X} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Where $f(Y)$ is the number of strings that match $Y$ (at least $Y$).

    (If you have a hard time figuring out this, you can try drawing Venn Diagrams.)

    If we sum up on all $ans(X)$, we will get the final answer:

    $$ ans = \sum_{X ~ : ~ |X| = k} ans(X) $$

    However, asymptotics of this solution is $O(3^k \cdot k)$. To improve it, notice that different $ans(X)$ computations very often share $Y$ sets.

    We will reverse the formula of inclusion-exclusion and sum in terms of $Y$ sets. Now it becomes clear that the same set $Y$ would be taken into account in the computation of $ans(X)$ of $\binom{|Y|}{k}$ sets with the same sign $(-1)^{|Y| - k}$.

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Now our solution has asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    We will now solve the second version of the problem: find the number of strings that match **at least** $k$ of the patterns.

    Of course, we can just use the solution to the first version of the problem and add the answers for sets with size greater than $k$. However, you may notice that in this problem, a set |Y| is considered in the formula for all sets with size $\ge k$ which are contained in $Y$. That said, we can write the part of the expression that is being multiplied by $f(Y)$ as:


    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-1} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+1} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-2} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+2} + \cdots + (-1)^{|Y|-|Y|} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{|Y|} $$

    Looking at Graham's (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. "Concrete mathematics" [1998] ), we see a well-known formula for [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \cdot \binom{n}{k} = (-1)^m \cdot \binom{n-1}{m} $$

    Applying it here, we find that the entire sum of binomial coefficients is minimized:

    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} $$

    Thus, for this task, we also obtained a solution with the asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$:

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    ### The number of ways of going from a cell to another

    There is a field $n \times m$, and $k$ of its cells are impassable walls. A robot is initially at the cell $(1,1)$ (bottom left). The robot can only move right or up, and eventually it needs to get into the cell $(n,m)$, avoiding all obstacles. You need to count the number of ways he can do it.

    Assume that the sizes $n$ and $m$ are very large (say, $10^9$), and the number $k$ is small (around $100$).

    For now, sort the obstacles by their coordinate $x$, and in case of equality — coordinate $y$.

    Also just learn how to solve a problem without obstacles: i.e. learn how to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another. In one axis, we need to go through $x$ cells, and on the other, $y$ cells. From simple combinatorics, we get a formula using [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$\binom{x+y}{x}$$

    Now to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another, avoiding all obstacles, you can use inclusion-exclusion to solve the inverse problem: count the number of ways to walk through the board stepping at a subset of obstacles (and subtract it from the total number of ways).

    When iterating over a subset of the obstacles that we'll step, to count the number of ways to do this simply multiply the number of all paths from starting cell to the first of the selected obstacles, a first obstacle to the second, and so on, and then add or subtract this number from the answer, in accordance with the standard formula of inclusion-exclusion.

    However, this will again be non-polynomial in complexity $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    Here goes a polynomial solution:

    We will use dynamic programming. For convenience, push (1,1) to the beginning and (n,m) at the end of the obstacles array. Let's compute the numbers $d[i]$ — the number of ways to get from the starting point ($0-th$) to $i-th$, without stepping on any other obstacle (except for $i$, of course). We will compute this number for all the obstacle cells, and also for the ending one.

    Let's forget for a second the obstacles and just count the number of paths from cell $0$ to $i$. We need to consider some "bad" paths, the ones that pass through the obstacles, and subtract them from the total number of ways of going from $0$ to $i$.

    When considering an obstacle $t$ between $0$ and $i$ ($0 < t < i$), on which we can step, we see that the number of paths from $0$ to $i$ that pass through $t$ which have $t$ as the **first obstacle between start and $i$**. We can compute that as: $d[t]$ multiplied by the number of arbitrary paths from $t$ to $i$. We can count the number of "bad" ways summing this for all $t$ between $0$ and $i$.

    We can compute $d[i]$ in $O(k)$ for $O(k)$ obstacles, so this solution has complexity $O(k^2)$.

    ### The number of coprime quadruples

    You're given $n$ numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You are required to count the number of ways to choose four numbers so that their combined greatest common divisor is equal to one.

    We will solve the inverse problem — compute the number of "bad" quadruples, i.e. quadruples in which all numbers are divisible by a number $d > 1$.

    We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle while summing over all possible groups of four numbers divisible by a divisor $d$.

    $$ans = \sum_{d \ge 2} (-1)^{deg(d)-1} \cdot f(d)$$

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/111 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (nested lists) and finds the elements that are common across all the lists. The output should be a list of these common elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find common elements in nested lists, we can start by taking the first list as a reference and then check each element in this list against all other lists. If an element is found in all lists, we add it to our result. We can use a set to keep track of common elements for efficiency.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
       if nested_lists is empty:
           return empty list
       
       initialize common_elements with the first list converted to a set
       
       for each list in nested_lists starting from the second:
           convert the current list to a set
           update common_elements to keep only elements that are also in the current list
       
       return the list of common_elements
   ```

def common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
