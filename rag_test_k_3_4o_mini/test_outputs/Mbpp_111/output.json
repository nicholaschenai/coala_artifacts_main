    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists (nested lists) and finds the elements that are common across all the lists. The output should be a list of these common elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find common elements in nested lists, we can start by taking the first list as a reference and then check each element in this list against all other lists. If an element is found in all lists, we add it to our result. We can use a set to keep track of common elements for efficiency.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n       if nested_lists is empty:\n           return empty list\n       \n       initialize common_elements with the first list converted to a set\n       \n       for each list in nested_lists starting from the second:\n           convert the current list to a set\n           update common_elements to keep only elements that are also in the current list\n       \n       return the list of common_elements\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not nested_lists:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize common_elements with the first list converted to a set\n    common_elements = set(nested_lists[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through each list in the nested lists starting from the second\n    for lst in nested_lists[1:]:\n        # Convert the current list to a set\n        current_set = set(lst)\n        # Update common_elements to keep only elements that are also in the current list\n        common_elements.intersection_update(current_set)\n    \n    # Return the list of common elements\n    return list(common_elements)\n```",
