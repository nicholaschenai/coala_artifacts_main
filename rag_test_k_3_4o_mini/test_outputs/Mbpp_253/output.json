    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many elements in a given list are integers. The function should take a list as input and return the count of integer elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the list and check if it is an integer. We can maintain a counter that increments each time we find an integer. Finally, we will return the counter as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_integer(list):\n       initialize counter to 0\n       for each element in list:\n           if element is an integer:\n               increment counter\n       return counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_integer(lst):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of integer elements\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through each element in the provided list\n    for element in lst:\n        # Check if the current element is an integer\n        if isinstance(element, int):\n            # Increment the counter if it is an integer\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of integer elements\n    return count\n```",
