INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/563 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the values that are enclosed in quotation marks. The output should be a list of these extracted values.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and look for quotation marks. When we find an opening quotation mark, we can start collecting characters until we reach a closing quotation mark. Once we find the closing quotation mark, we can store the collected characters as a value in a list. We will continue this process until we have scanned the entire string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function extract_values(input_string):
       initialize an empty list to store results
       initialize an empty string to collect characters
       set a flag to indicate if we are inside quotes
       
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is a quotation mark:
               if we are inside quotes:
                   add the collected string to results
                   reset the collected string

    Title: Expression parsing
    Part: 1/2
    # Expression parsing

    A string containing a mathematical expression containing numbers and various operators is given.
    We have to compute the value of it in $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.

    The algorithm discussed here translates an expression into the so-called **reverse Polish notation** (explicitly or implicitly), and evaluates this expression.

    ## Reverse Polish notation

    The reverse Polish notation is a form of writing mathematical expressions, in which the operators are located after their operands.
    For example the following expression

    $$a + b * c * d + (e - f) * (g * h + i)$$

    can be written in reverse Polish notation in the following way:

    $$a b c * d * + e f - g h * i + * +$$

    The reverse Polish notation was developed by the Australian philosopher and computer science specialist Charles Hamblin in the mid 1950s on the basis of the Polish notation, which was proposed in 1920 by the Polish mathematician Jan ≈Åukasiewicz.

    The convenience of the reverse Polish notation is, that expressions in this form are very **easy to evaluate** in linear time.
    We use a stack, which is initially empty.
    We will iterate over the operands and operators of the expression in reverse Polish notation.
    If the current element is a number, then we put the value on top of the stack, if the current element is an operator, then we get the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and put the result back on top of the stack.
    In the end there will be exactly one element left in the stack, which will be the value of the expression.

    Obviously this simple evaluation runs in $O(n)$ time.

    ## Parsing of simple expressions

    For the time being we only consider a simplified problem:
    we assume that all operators are **binary** (i.e. they take two arguments), and all are **left-associative** (if the priorities are equal, they get executed from left to right).
    Parentheses are allowed.

    We will set up two stacks: one for numbers, and one for operators and parentheses.
    Initially both stacks are empty.
    For the second stack we will maintain the condition that all operations are ordered by strict descending priority.
    If there are parenthesis on the stack, than each block of operators (corresponding to one pair of parenthesis) is ordered, and the entire stack is not necessarily ordered.

    We will iterate over the characters of the expression from left to right.
    If the current character is a digit, then we put the value of this number on the stack.
    If the current character is an opening parenthesis, then we put it on the stack.
    If the current character is a closing parenthesis, the we execute all operators on the stack until we reach the opening bracket (in other words we perform all operations inside the parenthesis).
    Finally if the current character is an operator, then while the top of the stack has an operator with the same or higher priority, we will execute this operation, and put the new operation on the stack.

    After we processed the entire string, some operators might still be in the stack, so we execute them.

    Here is the implementation of this method for the four operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$:

    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_simple}
    bool delim(char c) {
        return c == ' ';
    }

    bool is_op(char c) {
        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';
    }

    int priority (char op) {
        if (op == '+' || op == '-')
            return 1;
        if (op == '*' || op == '/')
            return 2;
        return -1;
    }

    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {
        int r = st.top(); st.pop();
        int l = st.top(); st.pop();
        switch (op) {
            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;
            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;
            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;
            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;
        }
    }

    int evaluate(string& s) {
        stack<int> st;
        stack<char> op;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {
            if (delim(s[i]))
                continue;
        
            if (s[i] == '(') {
                op.push('(');
            } else if (s[i] == ')') {
                while (op.top() != '(') {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.pop();
            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {
                char cur_op = s[i];
                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.push(cur_op);
            } else {
                int number = 0;
                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))
                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';
                --i;
                st.push(number);
            }
        }

        while (!op.empty()) {
            process_op(st, op.top());
            op.pop();
        }
        return st.top();
    }
    ```

    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.
    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.

    ## Unary operators

    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).
    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.

    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.

    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).
    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.
    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. 

    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.
    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.

    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.

    ## Right-associativity

    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.

    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.
    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \wedge b \wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).

    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?
    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.
    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.

    The only line that needs to be replaced is
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))
    ```
    with
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && (
            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||
            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))
        ))

    Title: Z-function and its calculation
    Part: 1/2
    # Z-function and its calculation

    Suppose we are given a string $s$ of length $n$. The **Z-function** for this string is an array of length $n$ where the $i$-th element is equal to the greatest number of characters starting from the position $i$ that coincide with the first characters of $s$.

    In other words, $z[i]$ is the length of the longest string that is, at the same time, a prefix of $s$ and a prefix of the suffix of $s$ starting at $i$.

    **Note.** In this article, to avoid ambiguity, we assume $0$-based indexes; that is: the first character of $s$ has index $0$ and the last one has index $n-1$.

    The first element of Z-function, $z[0]$, is generally not well defined. In this article we will assume it is zero (although it doesn't change anything in the algorithm implementation).

    This article presents an algorithm for calculating the Z-function in $O(n)$ time, as well as various of its applications.

    ## Examples

    For example, here are the values of the Z-function computed for different strings:

    * "aaaaa" - $[0, 4, 3, 2, 1]$
    * "aaabaab" - $[0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]$
    * "abacaba" - $[0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1]$

    ## Trivial algorithm

    Formal definition can be represented in the following elementary $O(n^2)$ implementation.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> z_function_trivial(string s) {
    	int n = s.size();
    	vector<int> z(n);
    	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    		while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {
    			z[i]++;
    		}
    	}
    	return z;
    }
    ```

    We just iterate through every position $i$ and update $z[i]$ for each one of them, starting from $z[i] = 0$ and incrementing it as long as we don't find a mismatch (and as long as we don't reach the end of the line).

    Of course, this is not an efficient implementation. We will now show the construction of an efficient implementation.

    ## Efficient algorithm to compute the Z-function

    To obtain an efficient algorithm we will compute the values of $z[i]$ in turn from $i = 1$ to $n - 1$ but at the same time, when computing a new value, we'll try to make the best use possible of the previously computed values.

    For the sake of brevity, let's call **segment matches** those substrings that coincide with a prefix of $s$. For example, the value of the desired Z-function $z[i]$ is the length of the segment match starting at position $i$ (and that ends at position $i + z[i] - 1$).

    To do this, we will keep **the $[l, r)$ indices of the rightmost segment match**. That is, among all detected segments we will keep the one that ends rightmost. In a way, the index $r$ can be seen as the "boundary" to which our string $s$ has been scanned by the algorithm; everything beyond that point is not yet known.

    Then, if the current index (for which we have to compute the next value of the Z-function) is $i$, we have one of two options:

    *   $i \geq r$ -- the current position is **outside** of what we have already processed.

        We will then compute $z[i]$ with the **trivial algorithm** (that is, just comparing values one by one). Note that in the end, if $z[i] > 0$, we'll have to update the indices of the rightmost segment, because it's guaranteed that the new $r = i + z[i]$ is better than the previous $r$.

    *   $i < r$ -- the current position is inside the current segment match $[l, r)$.

        Then we can use the already calculated Z-values to "initialize" the value of $z[i]$ to something (it sure is better than "starting from zero"), maybe even some big number.

        For this, we observe that the substrings $s[l \dots r)$ and $s[0 \dots r-l)$ **match**. This means that as an initial approximation for $z[i]$ we can take the value already computed for the corresponding segment $s[0 \dots r-l)$, and that is $z[i-l]$.

        However, the value $z[i-l]$ could be too large: when applied to position $i$ it could exceed the index $r$. This is not allowed because we know nothing about the characters to the right of $r$: they may differ from those required.

        Here is **an example** of a similar scenario:

        $$ s = "aaaabaa" $$

        When we get to the last position ($i = 6$), the current match segment will be $[5, 7)$. Position $6$ will then match position $6 - 5 = 1$, for which the value of the Z-function is $z[1] = 3$. Obviously, we cannot initialize $z[6]$ to $3$, it would be completely incorrect. The maximum value we could initialize it to is $1$ -- because it's the largest value that doesn't bring us beyond the index $r$ of the match segment $[l, r)$.

        Thus, as an **initial approximation** for $z[i]$ we can safely take:

        $$ z_0[i] = \min(r - i,\; z[i-l]) $$

        After having $z[i]$ initialized to $z_0[i]$, we try to increment $z[i]$ by running the **trivial algorithm** -- because in general, after the border $r$, we cannot know if the segment will continue to match or not.

    Thus, the whole algorithm is split in two cases, which differ only in **the initial value** of $z[i]$: in the first case it's assumed to be zero, in the second case it is determined by the previously computed values (using the above formula). After that, both branches of this algorithm can be reduced to the implementation of **the trivial algorithm**, which starts immediately after we specify the initial value.

    The algorithm turns out to be very simple. Despite the fact that on each iteration the trivial algorithm is run, we have made significant progress, having an algorithm that runs in linear time. Later on we will prove that the running time is linear.

    ## Implementation

    Implementation turns out to be rather concise:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> z_function(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> z(n);
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if(i < r) {
                z[i] = min(r - i, z[i - l]);
            }
            while(i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {
                z[i]++;
            }
            if(i + z[i] > r) {
                l = i;
                r = i + z[i];
            }
        }
        return z;
    }

    Title: Balanced bracket sequences
    Part: 1/2
    # Balanced bracket sequences

    A **balanced bracket sequence** is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence, when inserted certain numbers and mathematical operations, gives a valid mathematical expression.
    Formally you can define balanced bracket sequence with:

    - $e$ (the empty string) is a balanced bracket sequence.
    - if $s$ is a balanced bracket sequence, then so is $(s)$.
    - if $s$ and $t$ are balanced bracket sequences, then so is $s t$.

    For instance $(())()$ is a balanced bracket sequence, but $())($ is not.

    Of course you can define other bracket sequences also with multiple bracket types in a similar fashion.

    In this article we discuss some classic problems involving balanced bracket sequences (for simplicity we will only call them sequences): validation, number of sequences, finding the lexicographical next sequence, generating all sequences of a certain size, finding the index of sequence, and generating the $k$-th sequences.
    We will also discuss two variations for the problems, the simpler version when only one type of brackets is allowed, and the harder case when there are multiple types.

    ## Balance validation

    We want to check if a given string is balanced or not.

    At first suppose there is only one type of bracket.
    For this case there exists a very simple algorithm.
    Let $\text{depth}$ be the current number of open brackets.
    Initially $\text{depth} = 0$.
    We iterate over all character of the string, if the current bracket character is an opening bracket, then we increment $\text{depth}$, otherwise we decrement it.
    If at any time the variable $\text{depth}$ gets negative, or at the end it is different from $0$, then the string is not a balanced sequence.
    Otherwise it is.

    If there are several bracket types involved, then the algorithm needs to be changes.
    Instead of a counter $\text{depth}$ we create a stack, in which we will store all opening brackets that we meet.
    If the current bracket character is an opening one, we put it onto the stack.
    If it is a closing one, then we check if the stack is non-empty, and if the top element of the stack is of the same type as the current closing bracket.
    If both conditions are fulfilled, then we remove the opening bracket from the stack.
    If at any time one of the conditions is not fulfilled, or at the end the stack is not empty, then the string is not balanced.
    Otherwise it is.

    ## Number of balanced sequences

    ### Formula

    The number of balanced bracket sequences with only one bracket type can be calculated using the [Catalan numbers](catalan-numbers.md).
    The number of balanced bracket sequences of length $2n$ ($n$ pairs of brackets) is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$$

    If we allow $k$ types of brackets, then each pair be of any of the $k$ types (independently of the others), thus the number of balanced bracket sequences is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} k^n$$

    ### Dynamic programming

    On the other hand these numbers can be computed using **dynamic programming**.
    Let $d[n]$ be the number of regular bracket sequences with $n$ pairs of bracket.
    Note that in the first position there is always an opening bracket.
    And somewhere later is the corresponding closing bracket of the pair.
    It is clear that inside this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence, and similarly after this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence.
    So to compute $d[n]$, we will look at how many balanced sequences of $i$ pairs of brackets are inside this first bracket pair, and how many balanced sequences with $n-1-i$ pairs are after this pair.
    Consequently the formula has the form:

    $$d[n] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d[i] \cdot d[n-1-i]$$

    The initial value for this recurrence is $d[0] = 1$.

    ## Finding the lexicographical next balanced sequence

    Here we only consider the case with one valid bracket type.

    Given a balanced sequence, we have to find the next (in lexicographical order) balanced sequence.

    It should be obvious, that we have to find the rightmost opening bracket, which we can replace by a closing bracket without violation the condition, that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets up to this position.
    After replacing this position, we can fill the remaining part of the string with the lexicographically minimal one: i.e. first with as much opening brackets as possible, and then fill up the remaining positions with closing brackets.
    In other words we try to leave a long as possible prefix unchanged, and the suffix gets replaced by the lexicographically minimal one.

    To find this position, we can iterate over the character from right to left, and maintain the balance $\text{depth}$ of open and closing brackets.
    When we meet an opening brackets, we will decrement $\text{depth}$, and when we meet a closing bracket, we increase it.
    If we are at some point meet an opening bracket, and the balance after processing this symbol is positive, then we have found the rightmost position that we can change.
    We change the symbol, compute the number of opening and closing brackets that we have to add to the right side, and arrange them in the lexicographically minimal way.

    If we find do suitable position, then this sequence is already the maximal possible one, and there is no answer.

    ```{.cpp file=next_balanced_brackets_sequence}
    bool next_balanced_sequence(string & s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '(')
                depth--;
            else
                depth++;

            if (s[i] == '(' && depth > 0) {
                depth--;
                int open = (n - i - 1 - depth) / 2;
                int close = n - i - 1 - open;
                string next = s.substr(0, i) + ')' + string(open, '(') + string(close, ')');
                s.swap(next);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/563 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the values that are enclosed within quotation marks. The output should be a list of these extracted values.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string character by character. We will keep track of whether we are currently inside quotation marks. When we encounter a quotation mark, we will toggle our state (inside or outside). If we are inside quotation marks, we will collect the characters until we reach the next quotation mark. Once we reach the end of the string, we will return the collected values as a list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function extract_values(input_string):
       initialize an empty list to store results
       initialize an empty string to collect current value
       set a boolean variable is_inside_quotes to False
       
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is a quotation mark:
               if is_inside_quotes is True:
                   add current value to results
                   reset current value
                   set is_inside_quotes to False
               else:
                   set is_inside_quotes to True
           else if is_inside_quotes is True:
               append character to current value
