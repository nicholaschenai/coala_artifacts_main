The **Z-function** for this string is an array of length $n$ where the $i$-th element is equal to the greatest number of characters starting from the position $i$ that coincide with the first characters of $s$.\n\n    In other words, $z[i]$ is the length of the longest string that is, at the same time, a prefix of $s$ and a prefix of the suffix of $s$ starting at $i$.\n\n    **Note.** In this article, to avoid ambiguity, we assume $0$-based indexes; that is: the first character of $s$ has index $0$ and the last one has index $n-1$.\n\n    The first element of Z-function, $z[0]$, is generally not well defined. In this article we will assume it is zero (although it doesn't change anything in the algorithm implementation).\n\n    This article presents an algorithm for calculating the Z-function in $O(n)$ time, as well as various of its applications.\n\n    ## Examples\n\n    For example, here are the values of the Z-function computed for different strings:\n\n    * \"aaaaa\" - $[0, 4, 3, 2, 1]$\n    * \"aaabaab\" - $[0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]$\n    * \"abacaba\" - $[0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1]$\n\n    ## Trivial algorithm\n\n    Formal definition can be represented in the following elementary $O(n^2)$ implementation.\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> z_function_trivial(string s) {\n    \tint n = s.size();\n    \tvector<int> z(n);\n    \tfor (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n    \t\twhile (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {\n    \t\t\tz[i]++;\n    \t\t}\n    \t}\n    \treturn z;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We just iterate through every position $i$ and update $z[i]$ for each one of them, starting from $z[i] = 0$ and incrementing it as long as we don't find a mismatch (and as long as we don't reach the end of the line).\n\n    Of course, this is not an efficient implementation. We will now show the construction of an efficient implementation.\n\n    ## Efficient algorithm to compute the Z-function\n\n    To obtain an efficient algorithm we will compute the values of $z[i]$ in turn from $i = 1$ to $n - 1$ but at the same time, when computing a new value, we'll try to make the best use possible of the previously computed values.\n\n    For the sake of brevity, let's call **segment matches** those substrings that coincide with a prefix of $s$. For example, the value of the desired Z-function $z[i]$ is the length of the segment match starting at position $i$ (and that ends at position $i + z[i] - 1$).\n\n    To do this, we will keep **the $[l, r)$ indices of the rightmost segment match**. That is, among all detected segments we will keep the one that ends rightmost. In a way, the index $r$ can be seen as the \"boundary\" to which our string $s$ has been scanned by the algorithm; everything beyond that point is not yet known.\n\n    Then, if the current index (for which we have to compute the next value of the Z-function) is $i$, we have one of two options:\n\n    *   $i \\geq r$ -- the current position is **outside** of what we have already processed.\n\n        We will then compute $z[i]$ with the **trivial algorithm** (that is, just comparing values one by one). Note that in the end, if $z[i] > 0$, we'll have to update the indices of the rightmost segment, because it's guaranteed that the new $r = i + z[i]$ is better than the previous $r$.\n\n    *   $i < r$ -- the current position is inside the current segment match $[l, r)$.\n\n        Then we can use the already calculated Z-values to \"initialize\" the value of $z[i]$ to something (it sure is better than \"starting from zero\"), maybe even some big number.\n\n        For this, we observe that the substrings $s[l \\dots r)$ and $s[0 \\dots r-l)$ **match**. This means that as an initial approximation for $z[i]$ we can take the value already computed for the corresponding segment $s[0 \\dots r-l)$, and that is $z[i-l]$.\n\n        However, the value $z[i-l]$ could be too large: when applied to position $i$ it could exceed the index $r$. This is not allowed because we know nothing about the characters to the right of $r$: they may differ from those required.\n\n        Here is **an example** of a similar scenario:\n\n        $$ s = \"aaaabaa\" $$\n\n        When we get to the last position ($i = 6$), the current match segment will be $[5, 7)$. Position $6$ will then match position $6 - 5 = 1$, for which the value of the Z-function is $z[1] = 3$. Obviously, we cannot initialize $z[6]$ to $3$, it would be completely incorrect. The maximum value we could initialize it to is $1$ -- because it's the largest value that doesn't bring us beyond the index $r$ of the match segment $[l, r)$.\n\n        Thus, as an **initial approximation** for $z[i]$ we can safely take:\n\n        $$ z_0[i] = \\min(r - i,\\; z[i-l]) $$\n\n        After having $z[i]$ initialized to $z_0[i]$, we try to increment $z[i]$ by running the **trivial algorithm** -- because in general, after the border $r$, we cannot know if the segment will continue to match or not.\n\n    Thus, the whole algorithm is split in two cases, which differ only in **the initial value** of $z[i]$: in the first case it's assumed to be zero, in the second case it is determined by the previously computed values (using the above formula). After that, both branches of this algorithm can be reduced to the implementation of **the trivial algorithm**, which starts immediately after we specify the initial value.\n\n    The algorithm turns out to be very simple. Despite the fact that on each iteration the trivial algorithm is run, we have made significant progress, having an algorithm that runs in linear time. Later on we will prove that the running time is linear.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Implementation turns out to be rather concise:\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> z_function(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> z(n);\n        int l = 0, r = 0;\n        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            if(i < r) {\n                z[i] = min(r - i, z[i - l]);\n            }\n            while(i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {\n                z[i]++;\n            }\n            if(i + z[i] > r) {\n                l = i;\n                r = i + z[i];\n            }\n        }\n        return z;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Balanced bracket sequences\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Balanced bracket sequences\n\n    A **balanced bracket sequence** is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence, when inserted certain numbers and mathematical operations, gives a valid mathematical expression.\n    Formally you can define balanced bracket sequence with:\n\n    - $e$ (the empty string) is a balanced bracket sequence.\n    - if $s$ is a balanced bracket sequence, then so is $(s)$.\n    - if $s$ and $t$ are balanced bracket sequences, then so is $s t$.\n\n    For instance $(())()$ is a balanced bracket sequence, but $())($ is not.\n\n    Of course you can define other bracket sequences also with multiple bracket types in a similar fashion.\n\n    In this article we discuss some classic problems involving balanced bracket sequences (for simplicity we will only call them sequences): validation, number of sequences, finding the lexicographical next sequence, generating all sequences of a certain size, finding the index of sequence, and generating the $k$-th sequences.\n    We will also discuss two variations for the problems, the simpler version when only one type of brackets is allowed, and the harder case when there are multiple types.\n\n    ## Balance validation\n\n    We want to check if a given string is balanced or not.\n\n    At first suppose there is only one type of bracket.\n    For this case there exists a very simple algorithm.\n    Let $\\text{depth}$ be the current number of open brackets.\n    Initially $\\text{depth} = 0$.\n    We iterate over all character of the string, if the current bracket character is an opening bracket, then we increment $\\text{depth}$, otherwise we decrement it.\n    If at any time the variable $\\text{depth}$ gets negative, or at the end it is different from $0$, then the string is not a balanced sequence.\n    Otherwise it is.\n\n    If there are several bracket types involved, then the algorithm needs to be changes.\n    Instead of a counter $\\text{depth}$ we create a stack, in which we will store all opening brackets that we meet.\n    If the current bracket character is an opening one, we put it onto the stack.\n    If it is a closing one, then we check if the stack is non-empty, and if the top element of the stack is of the same type as the current closing bracket.\n    If both conditions are fulfilled, then we remove the opening bracket from the stack.\n    If at any time one of the conditions is not fulfilled, or at the end the stack is not empty, then the string is not balanced.\n    Otherwise it is.\n\n    ## Number of balanced sequences\n\n    ### Formula\n\n    The number of balanced bracket sequences with only one bracket type can be calculated using the [Catalan numbers](catalan-numbers.md).\n    The number of balanced bracket sequences of length $2n$ ($n$ pairs of brackets) is:\n\n    $$\\frac{1}{n+1} \\binom{2n}{n}$$\n\n    If we allow $k$ types of brackets, then each pair be of any of the $k$ types (independently of the others), thus the number of balanced bracket sequences is:\n\n    $$\\frac{1}{n+1} \\binom{2n}{n} k^n$$\n\n    ### Dynamic programming\n\n    On the other hand these numbers can be computed using **dynamic programming**.\n    Let $d[n]$ be the number of regular bracket sequences with $n$ pairs of bracket.\n    Note that in the first position there is always an opening bracket.\n    And somewhere later is the corresponding closing bracket of the pair.\n    It is clear that inside this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence, and similarly after this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence.\n    So to compute $d[n]$, we will look at how many balanced sequences of $i$ pairs of brackets are inside this first bracket pair, and how many balanced sequences with $n-1-i$ pairs are after this pair.\n    Consequently the formula has the form:\n\n    $$d[n] = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d[i] \\cdot d[n-1-i]$$\n\n    The initial value for this recurrence is $d[0] = 1$.\n\n    ## Finding the lexicographical next balanced sequence\n\n    Here we only consider the case with one valid bracket type.\n\n    Given a balanced sequence, we have to find the next (in lexicographical order) balanced sequence.\n\n    It should be obvious, that we have to find the rightmost opening bracket, which we can replace by a closing bracket without violation the condition, that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets up to this position.\n    After replacing this position, we can fill the remaining part of the string with the lexicographically minimal one: i.e. first with as much opening brackets as possible, and then fill up the remaining positions with closing brackets.\n    In other words we try to leave a long as possible prefix unchanged, and the suffix gets replaced by the lexicographically minimal one.\n\n    To find this position, we can iterate over the character from right to left, and maintain the balance $\\text{depth}$ of open and closing brackets.\n    When we meet an opening brackets, we will decrement $\\text{depth}$, and when we meet a closing bracket, we increase it.\n    If we are at some point meet an opening bracket, and the balance after processing this symbol is positive, then we have found the rightmost position that we can change.\n    We change the symbol, compute the number of opening and closing brackets that we have to add to the right side, and arrange them in the lexicographically minimal way.\n\n    If we find do suitable position, then this sequence is already the maximal possible one, and there is no answer.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_balanced_brackets_sequence}\n    bool next_balanced_sequence(string & s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        int depth = 0;\n        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (s[i] == '(')\n                depth--;\n            else\n                depth++;\n\n            if (s[i] == '(' && depth > 0) {\n                depth--;\n                int open = (n - i - 1 - depth) / 2;\n                int close = n - i - 1 - open;\n                string next = s.substr(0, i) + ')' + string(open, '(') + string(close, ')');\n                s.swap(next);\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The output should be a list of these extracted values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string character by character. We will keep track of whether we are currently inside quotation marks. When we encounter a quotation mark, we will toggle our state (inside or outside). If we are inside quotation marks, we will collect the characters until we reach the next quotation mark. Once we reach the end of the string, we will return the collected values as a list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function extract_values(input_string):\n       initialize an empty list to store results\n       initialize an empty string to collect current value\n       set a boolean variable is_inside_quotes to False\n       \n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is a quotation mark:\n               if is_inside_quotes is True:\n                   add current value to results\n                   reset current value\n                   set is_inside_quotes to False\n               else:\n                   set is_inside_quotes to True\n           else if is_inside_quotes is True:\n               append character to current value\n       \n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef extract_values(input_string: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store results\n    results = []\n    # Initialize an empty string to collect the current value\n    current_value = \"\"\n    # Boolean to track if we are inside quotes\n    is_inside_quotes = False\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # Check if the character is a quotation mark\n        if char == '\"':\n            # If we are already inside quotes, we need to close it\n            if is_inside_quotes:\n                # Add the collected value to results\n                results.append(current_value)\n                # Reset the current value for the next potential value\n                current_value = \"\"\n                # Toggle the state to outside quotes\n                is_inside_quotes = False\n            else:\n                # We are entering quotes, toggle the state\n                is_inside_quotes = True\n        elif is_inside_quotes:\n            # If we are inside quotes, collect the characters\n            current_value += char\n    \n    # Return the list of extracted values\n    return results\n```"
