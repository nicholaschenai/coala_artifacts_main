    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the values that are enclosed within quotation marks. The output should be a list of these extracted values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string character by character. We will keep track of whether we are currently inside quotation marks. When we encounter a quotation mark, we will toggle our state (inside or outside). If we are inside quotation marks, we will collect the characters until we reach the next quotation mark. Once we reach the end of the string, we will return the collected values as a list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function extract_values(input_string):\n       initialize an empty list to store results\n       initialize an empty string to collect current value\n       set a boolean variable is_inside_quotes to False\n       \n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is a quotation mark:\n               if is_inside_quotes is True:\n                   add current value to results\n                   reset current value\n                   set is_inside_quotes to False\n               else:\n                   set is_inside_quotes to True\n           else if is_inside_quotes is True:\n               append character to current value\n       \n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef extract_values(input_string: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store results\n    results = []\n    # Initialize an empty string to collect the current value\n    current_value = \"\"\n    # Boolean to track if we are inside quotes\n    is_inside_quotes = False\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # Check if the character is a quotation mark\n        if char == '\"':\n            # If we are already inside quotes, we need to close it\n            if is_inside_quotes:\n                # Add the collected value to results\n                results.append(current_value)\n                # Reset the current value for the next potential value\n                current_value = \"\"\n                # Toggle the state to outside quotes\n                is_inside_quotes = False\n            else:\n                # We are entering quotes, toggle the state\n                is_inside_quotes = True\n        elif is_inside_quotes:\n            # If we are inside quotes, collect the characters\n            current_value += char\n    \n    # Return the list of extracted values\n    return results\n```",
