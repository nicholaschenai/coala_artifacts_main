   We need to create a function that takes a list of single-digit integers and returns the largest possible number that can be formed by arranging those digits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the largest number, we can convert each digit to a string, sort the strings in descending order, and then concatenate them to form the final number. Finally, we will convert the concatenated string back to an integer to return the result.

    Title: Longest increasing subsequence
    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    It is also possible to restore the subsequence using this approach.
    This time we have to maintain two auxiliary arrays.
    One that tells us the index of the elements in $d[]$.
    And again we have to create an array of "ancestors" $p[i]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index of the previous element for the optimal subsequence ending in element $i$.

    It's easy to maintain these two arrays in the course of iteration over the array $a[]$ alongside the computations of $d[]$.
    And at the end it is not difficult to restore the desired subsequence using these arrays.

    ## Solution in $O(n \log n)$ with data structures {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n log n) with data structures"}

    Instead of the above method for computing the longest increasing subsequence in $O(n \log n)$ we can also solve the problem in a different way: using some simple data structures.

    Let's go back to the first method.
    Remember that $d[i]$ is the value $d[j] + 1$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

    Thus if we define an additional array $t[]$ such that

    $$t[a[i]] = d[i],$$

    then the problem of computing the value $d[i]$ is equivalent to finding the **maximum value in a prefix** of the array $t[]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(t[0 \dots a[i] - 1] + 1\right)$$

    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. 
    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).

    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:
    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.
    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).
    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.

    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:
    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.
    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).

    ## Related tasks

    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.

    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence

    This is in fact nearly the same problem.
    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.

    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.
    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.

    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences

    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.
    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.

    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.
    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.

    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \log n)$.

    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.

    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence

    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.

    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    **Proof**:
    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.

    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.
    We need to prove that $x = y$.

    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.
    Therefore we have $y \ge x$.

    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.
    Suppose that $y > x$.
    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.
    We transform this in set in the following way:
    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.
    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.
    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.

    Thus it follows that $y = x$.

    **Restoring the sequences**:
    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.
    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 1/2
    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum

    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).

    ## Problem statement

    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:

    $$ \max_{ 1 \le l \le r \le n } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.
    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.

    ## Algorithm 1

    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm is very simple.

    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.

    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.

    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.

    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.

    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.

    ### Implementation

    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ — we will only need the current element from it.

    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.

    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);
        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);
    }
    ```

    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        int cur = sum - min_sum;
        if (cur > ans) {
            ans = cur;
            ans_l = min_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = sum;
            min_pos = r;
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Algorithm 2

    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.

    **Proof:**

    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum — so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.

    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.

    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a "critical" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.

    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.

    ### Implementation

    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum);
        sum = max(sum, 0);
    }
    ```

    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        if (sum > ans) {
            ans = sum;
            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < 0) {
            sum = 0;
            minus_pos = r;
        }
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/57 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of digits (numbers from 0 to 9) and returns the largest possible number that can be formed by arranging those digits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the largest number, we can sort the digits in descending order. Once sorted, we can concatenate them to form the largest possible number. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3], sorting it in descending order gives us [3, 2, 1], which concatenates to form the number 321.

INFO - raw_msg:
 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of digits (numbers from 0 to 9) and returns the largest possible number that can be formed by arranging those digits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the largest number, we can sort the digits in descending order. Once sorted, we can concatenate them to form the largest possible number. For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3], sorting it in descending order gives us [3, 2, 1], which concatenates to form the number 321.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_Max_Num(digits):
       sort digits in descending order
       concatenate sorted digits into a single number
       return the concatenated number
   ```
