It relates the sizes of individual sets with their union.\n\n    ## Statement\n\n    ### The verbal formula\n\n    The inclusion-exclusion principle can be expressed as follows:\n\n    To compute the size of a union of multiple sets, it is necessary to sum the sizes of these sets **separately**, and then subtract the sizes of all **pairwise** intersections of the sets, then add back the size of the intersections of **triples** of the sets, subtract the size of **quadruples** of the sets, and so on, up to the intersection of **all** sets.\n\n    ### The formulation in terms of sets\n\n    The above definition can be expressed mathematically as follows:\n\n    $$\\left| \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right| = \\sum_{i=1}^n|A_i| - \\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n} |A_i \\cap A_j| + \\sum _{1\\leq i<j<k\\leq n}|A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} | A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n |$$\n\n    And in a more compact way:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right| = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\\Biggl |}\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}{\\Biggr |}$$\n\n    ### The formulation using Venn diagrams\n\n    Let the diagram show three sets $A$, $B$ and $C$:\n\n    ![Venn diagram](venn-inclusion-exclusion.png \"Venn diagram\")\n\n    Then the area of their union $A \\cup B \\cup C$ is equal to the sum of the areas $A$, $B$ and $C$ less double-covered areas $A \\cap B$, $A \\cap C$, $B \\cap C$, but with the addition of the area covered by three sets $A \\cap B \\cap C$:\n\n    $$S(A \\cup B \\cup C) = S(A) + S(B) + S(C) - S(A \\cap B) - S(A \\cap C) - S(B \\cap C) + S(A \\cap B \\cap C)$$\n\n    It can also be generalized for an association of $n$ sets.\n\n    ### The formulation in terms of probability theory\n\n    If $A_i$ $(i = 1,2...n)$ are events and ${\\cal P}(A_i)$ the probability of an event from $A_i$ to occur, then the probability of their union (i.e. the probability that at least one of the events occur) is equal to:\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    {\\cal P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) &=& \\sum_{i=1}^n{\\cal P}(A_i)\\ - \\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n} {\\cal P}(A_i \\cap A_j)\\  + \\\\\n    &+& \\sum _{1\\leq i<j<k\\leq n}{\\cal P}(A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k) - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} {\\cal P}( A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n )\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    And in a more compact way:\n\n    $${\\cal P} \\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\\ {\\cal P}{\\Biggl (}\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}{\\Biggr )}$$\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    For the proof it is convenient to use the mathematical formulation in terms of set theory:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right| = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\\Biggl |}\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}{\\Biggr |}$$\n\n    We want to prove that any element contained in at least one of the sets $A_i$ will occur in the formula only once (note that elements which are not present in any of the sets $A_i$ will never be considered on the right part of the formula).\n\n    Consider an element $x$ occurring in $k \\geq 1$ sets $A_i$. We will show it is counted only once in the formula. Note that:\n\n    * in terms which $|J| = 1$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\\ k$** times;\n    * in terms which $|J| = 2$, the item $x$ will be counted **$-\\ \\binom{k}{2}$** times - because it will be counted in those terms that include two of the $k$ sets containing $x$;\n    * in terms which $|J| = 3$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\\ \\binom{k}{3}$** times;\n    * $\\cdots$\n    * in terms which $|J| = k$, the item $x$ will be counted **$(-1)^{k-1}\\cdot \\binom{k}{k}$** times;\n    * in terms which $|J| \\gt k$, the item $x$ will be counted **zero** times;\n\n    This leads us to the following sum of [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):\n\n    $$ T = \\binom{k}{1} - \\binom{k}{2} + \\binom{k}{3} - \\cdots + (-1)^{i-1}\\cdot \\binom{k}{i} + \\cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\\cdot \\binom{k}{k}$$\n\n    This expression is very similar to the binomial expansion of $(1 - x)^k$:\n\n    $$ (1 - x)^k = \\binom{k}{0} - \\binom{k}{1} \\cdot x + \\binom{k}{2} \\cdot x^2 - \\binom{k}{3} \\cdot x^3 + \\cdots + (-1)^k\\cdot \\binom{k}{k} \\cdot x^k $$\n\n    When $x = 1$, $(1 - x)^k$ looks a lot like $T$. However, the expression has an additional $\\binom{k}{0} = 1$, and it is multiplied by $-1$. That leads us to $(1 - 1)^k = 1 - T$. Therefore $T = 1 - (1 - 1)^k = 1$, what was required to prove. The element is counted only once.\n\n    ## Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly $r$ sets {data-toc-label=\"Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly r sets\"}\n\n    Inclusion-exclusion principle can be rewritten to calculate number of elements which are present in zero sets:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcap_{i=1}^n \\overline{A_i}\\right|=\\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \\sum_{|X|=m} \\left|\\bigcap_{i\\in X} A_{i}\\right|$$\n\n    Consider its generalization to calculate number of elements which are present in exactly $r$ sets:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcup_{|B|=r}\\left[\\bigcap_{i \\in B} A_i \\cap \\bigcap_{j \\not\\in B} \\overline{A_j}\\right]\\right|=\\sum_{m=r}^n (-1)^{m-r}\\dbinom{m}{r} \\sum_{|X|=m} \\left|\\bigcap_{i \\in X} A_{i}\\right|$$\n\n    To prove this formula, consider some particular $B$. Due to basic inclusion-exclusion principle we can say about it that:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcap_{i \\in B} A_i \\cap \\bigcap_{j \\not \\in B} \\overline{A_j}\\right|=\\sum_{m=r}^{n} (-1)^{m-r} \\sum_{\\substack{|X|=m \\newline B \\subset X}}\\left|\\bigcap_{i\\in X} A_{i}\\right|$$\n\n    The sets on the left side do not intersect for different $B$, thus we can sum them up directly. Also one should note that any set $X$ will always have coefficient $(-1)^{m-r}$ if it occurs and it will occur for exactly $\\dbinom{m}{r}$ sets $B$. \n\n    ## Usage when solving problems\n\n    The inclusion-exclusion principle is hard to understand without studying its applications.\n\n    First, we will look at three simplest tasks \"at paper\", illustrating applications of the principle, and then consider more practical problems which are difficult to solve without inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n    Tasks asking to \"find the **number** of ways\" are worth of note, as they sometimes lead to polynomial solutions, not necessarily exponential.\n\n    ### A simple task on permutations\n\n    Task: count how many permutations of numbers from $0$ to $9$ exist such that the first element is greater than $1$ and the last one is less than $8$.\n\n    Let's count the number of \"bad\" permutations, that is, permutations in which the first element is $\\leq 1$ and/or the last is $\\geq 8$.\n\n    We will denote by $X$ the set of permutations in which the first element is $\\leq 1$ and $Y$ the set of permutations in which the last element is $\\geq 8$. Then the number of \"bad\" permutations, as on the inclusion-exclusion formula, will be:\n\n    $$ |X \\cup Y| = |X| + |Y| - |X \\cap Y| $$\n\n    After a simple combinatorial calculation, we will get to:\n\n    $$ 2 \\cdot 9! + 2 \\cdot 9! - 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8! $$\n\n    The only thing left is to subtract this number from the total of $10!$ to get the number of \"good\" permutations.\n\n    ### A simple task on (0, 1, 2) sequences\n\n    Task: count how many sequences of length $n$ exist consisting only of numbers $0,1,2$ such that each number occurs **at least once**.\n\n    Again let us turn to the inverse problem, i.e. we calculate the number of sequences which do **not** contain **at least one** of the numbers.\n\n    Let's denote by $A_i (i = 0,1,2)$ the set of sequences in which the digit $i$ does **not** occur.\n    The formula of inclusion-exclusion on the number of \"bad\" sequences will be:\n\n    $$ |A_0 \\cup A_1 \\cup A_2| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_0 \\cap A_1| - |A_0 \\cap A_2| - |A_1 \\cap A_2| + |A_0 \\cap A_1 \\cap A_2| $$\n\n    * The size of each $A_i$ is $2^n$, as each sequence can only contain two of the digits.\n    * The size of each pairwise intersection $A_i \\cap A_j$  is equal to $1$, as there will be only one digit to build the sequence.\n    * The size of the intersection of all three sets is equal to $0$, as there will be no digits to build the sequence.\n\n    As we solved the inverse problem, we subtract it from the total of $3^n$ sequences:\n\n    $$3^n - (3 \\cdot 2^n - 3 \\cdot 1 + 0)$$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: 2-SAT\n    Part: 1/2\n    # 2-SAT \n\n    SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) is the problem of assigning Boolean values to variables to satisfy a given Boolean formula.\n    The Boolean formula will usually be given in CNF (conjunctive normal form), which is a conjunction of multiple clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals (variables or negation of variables).\n    2-SAT (2-satisfiability) is a restriction of the SAT problem, in 2-SAT every clause has exactly two literals.\n    Here is an example of such a 2-SAT problem.\n    Find an assignment of $a, b, c$ such that the following formula is true:\n\n    $$(a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (a \\lor \\lnot c)$$\n\n    SAT is NP-complete, there is no known efficient solution known for it.\n    However 2SAT can be solved efficiently in $O(n + m)$ where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$ is the number of clauses.\n\n    ## Algorithm:\n\n    First we need to convert the problem to a different form, the so-called implicative normal form.\n    Note that the expression $a \\lor b$ is equivalent to $\\lnot a \\Rightarrow b \\land \\lnot b \\Rightarrow a$ (if one of the two variables is false, then the other one must be true).\n\n    We now construct a directed graph of these implications:\n    for each variable $x$ there will be two vertices $v_x$ and $v_{\\lnot x}$.\n    The edges will correspond to the implications.\n\n    Let's look at the example in 2-CNF form:\n\n    $$(a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (a \\lor \\lnot c)$$\n\n    The oriented graph will contain the following vertices and edges:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{cccc}\n    \\lnot a \\Rightarrow \\lnot b & a \\Rightarrow b & a \\Rightarrow \\lnot b & \\lnot a \\Rightarrow \\lnot c\\\\\n    b \\Rightarrow a & \\lnot b \\Rightarrow \\lnot a & b \\Rightarrow \\lnot a & c \\Rightarrow a\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    You can see the implication graph in the following image:\n\n    <center>![\"Implication Graph of 2-SAT example\"](2SAT.png)</center>\n\n    It is worth paying attention to the property of the implication graph:\n    if there is an edge $a \\Rightarrow b$, then there also is an edge $\\lnot b \\Rightarrow \\lnot a$. \n\n    Also note, that if $x$ is reachable from $\\lnot x$, and $\\lnot x$ is reachable from $x$, then the problem has no solution.\n    Whatever value we choose for the variable $x$, it will always end in a contradiction - if $x$ will be assigned $\\text{true}$ then the implication tell us that $\\lnot x$ should also be $\\text{true}$ and visa versa.\n    It turns out, that this condition is not only necessary, but also sufficient.\n    We will prove this in a few paragraphs below.\n    First recall, if a vertex is reachable from a second one, and the second one is reachable from the first one, then these two vertices are in the same strongly connected component.\n    Therefore we can formulate the criterion for the existence of a solution as follows:\n\n    In order for this 2-SAT problem to have a solution, it is necessary and sufficient that for any variable $x$ the vertices $x$ and $\\lnot x$ are in different strongly connected components of the strong connection of the implication graph.\n\n    This criterion can be verified in $O(n + m)$ time by finding all strongly connected components.\n\n    The following image shows all strongly connected components for the example.\n    As we can check easily, neither of the four components contain a vertex $x$ and its negation $\\lnot x$, therefore the example has a solution.\n    We will learn in the next paragraphs how to compute a valid assignment, but just for demonstration purposes the solution $a = \\text{false}$, $b = \\text{false}$, $c = \\text{false}$ is given.\n\n    <center>![\"Strongly Connected Components of the 2-SAT example\"](2SAT_SCC.png)</center>\n\n    Now we construct the algorithm for finding the solution of the 2-SAT problem on the assumption that the solution exists.\n\n    Note that, in spite of the fact that the solution exists, it can happen that $\\lnot x$ is reachable from $x$ in the implication graph, or that (but not simultaneously) $x$ is reachable from $\\lnot x$.\n    In that case the choice of either $\\text{true}$ or $\\text{false}$ for $x$ will lead to a contradiction, while the choice of the other one will not.\n    Let's learn how to choose a value, such that we don't generate a contradiction.\n\n    Let us sort the strongly connected components in topological order (i.e. $\\text{comp}[v] \\le \\text{comp}[u]$ if there is a path from $v$ to $u$) and let $\\text{comp}[v]$ denote the index of strongly connected component to which the vertex $v$ belongs.\n    Then, if $\\text{comp}[x] < \\text{comp}[\\lnot x]$ we assign $x$ with $\\text{false}$ and $\\text{true}$ otherwise.\n\n    Let us prove that with this assignment of the variables we do not arrive at a contradiction.\n    Suppose $x$ is assigned with $\\text{true}$.\n    The other case can be proven in a similar way.\n\n    First we prove that the vertex $x$ cannot reach the vertex $\\lnot x$.\n    Because we assigned $\\text{true}$ it has to hold that the index of strongly connected component of $x$ is greater than the index of the component of $\\lnot x$.\n    This means that $\\lnot x$ is located on the left of the component containing $x$, and the later vertex cannot reach the first.\n\n    Secondly we prove that there doesn't exist a variable $y$, such that the vertices $y$ and $\\lnot y$ are both reachable from $x$ in the implication graph.\n    This would cause a contradiction, because $x = \\text{true}$ implies that $y = \\text{true}$ and $\\lnot y = \\text{true}$.\n    Let us prove this by contradiction.\n    Suppose that $y$ and $\\lnot y$ are both reachable from $x$, then by the property of the implication graph $\\lnot x$ is reachable from both $y$ and $\\lnot y$.\n    By transitivity this results that $\\lnot x$ is reachable by $x$, which contradicts the assumption.\n\n    So we have constructed an algorithm that finds the required values of variables under the assumption that for any variable $x$ the vertices $x$ and $\\lnot x$ are in different strongly connected components.\n    Above showed the correctness of this algorithm.\n    Consequently we simultaneously proved the above criterion for the existence of a solution.\n\n    ## Implementation:\n\n    Now we can implement the entire algorithm.\n    First we construct the graph of implications and find all strongly connected components.\n    This can be accomplished with Kosaraju's algorithm in $O(n + m)$ time.\n    In the second traversal of the graph Kosaraju's algorithm visits the strongly connected components in topological order, therefore it is easy to compute $\\text{comp}[v]$ for each vertex $v$.\n\n    Afterwards we can choose the assignment of $x$ by comparing $\\text{comp}[x]$ and $\\text{comp}[\\lnot x]$. \n    If $\\text{comp}[x] = \\text{comp}[\\lnot x]$ we return $\\text{false}$ to indicate that there doesn't exist a valid assignment that satisfies the 2-SAT problem.\n\n    Below is the implementation of the solution of the 2-SAT problem for the already constructed graph of implication $adj$ and the transpose graph $adj^{\\intercal}$ (in which the direction of each edge is reversed).\n    In the graph the vertices with indices $2k$ and $2k+1$ are the two vertices corresponding to variable $k$ with $2k+1$ corresponding to the negated variable.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=2sat}\n    int n;\n    vector<vector<int>> adj,

If we finish checking all elements without finding a match, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_tuplex(tuple, element):\n       for each item in tuple:\n           if item is equal to element:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to check if an element exists in a tuple\ndef check_tuplex(tuplex, element):\n    # Iterate through each item in the tuple\n    for item in tuplex:\n        # Check if the current item matches the element\n        if item == element:\n            return True  # Return True if found\n    return False  # Return False if not found\n```"
