Its most common application is searching values in sorted arrays, however the splitting idea is crucial in many other typical tasks.\n\n    ## Search in sorted arrays\n\n    The most typical problem that leads to the binary search is as follows. You're given a sorted array $A_0 \\leq A_1 \\leq \\dots \\leq A_{n-1}$, check if $k$ is present within the sequence. The simplest solution would be to check every element one by one and compare it with $k$ (a so-called linear search). This approach works in $O(n)$, but doesn't utilize the fact that the array is sorted.\n\n    <center>\n    <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Binary_Search_Depiction.svg\" width=\"800px\">\n    <br>\n    <i>Binary search of the value $7$ in an array</i>.\n    <br>\n    <i>The <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binary_Search_Depiction.svg\">image</a> by [AlwaysAngry](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:AlwaysAngry) is distributed under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a></i> license.\n    </center>\n\n    Now assume that we know two indices $L < R$ such that $A_L \\leq k \\leq A_R$. Because the array is sorted, we can deduce that $k$ either occurs among $A_L, A_{L+1}, \\dots, A_R$ or doesn't occur in the array at all. If we pick an arbitrary index $M$ such that $L < M < R$ and check whether $k$ is less or greater than $A_M$. We have two possible cases:\n\n    1. $A_L \\leq k \\leq A_M$. In this case, we reduce the problem from $[L, R]$ to $[L, M]$;\n    1. $A_M \\leq k \\leq A_R$. In this case, we reduce the problem from $[L, R]$ to $[M, R]$.\n\n    When it is impossible to pick  $M$, that is, when $R = L + 1$, we directly compare $k$ with $A_L$ and $A_R$. Otherwise we would want to pick $M$ in such manner that it reduces the active segment to a single element as quickly as possible _in the worst case_.\n\n    Since in the worst case we will always reduce to larger segment of $[L, M]$ and $[M, R]$. Thus, in the worst case scenario the reduction would be from $R-L$ to $\\max(M-L, R-M)$. To minimize this value, we should pick $M \\approx \\frac{L+R}{2}$, then\n\n    $$\n    M-L \\approx \\frac{R-L}{2} \\approx R-M.\n    $$\n\n    In other words, from the worst-case scenario perspective it is optimal to always pick $M$ in the middle of $[L, R]$ and split it in half. Thus, the active segment halves on each step until it becomes of size $1$. So, if the process needs $h$ steps, in the end it reduces the difference between $R$ and $L$ from $R-L$ to $\\frac{R-L}{2^h} \\approx 1$, giving us the equation $2^h \\approx R-L$.\n\n    Taking $\\log_2$ on both sides, we get $h \\approx \\log_2(R-L) \\in O(\\log n)$.\n\n    Logarithmic number of steps is drastically better than that of linear search. For example, for $n \\approx 2^{20} \\approx 10^6$ you'd need to make approximately a million operations for linear search, but only around $20$ operations with the binary search.\n\n    ### Lower bound and upper bound\n\n    It is often convenient to find the position of the first element that is not less than $k$ (called the lower bound of $k$ in the array) or the position of the first element that is greater than $k$ (called the upper bound of $k$) rather than the exact position of the element.\n\n    Together, lower and upper bounds produce a possibly empty half-interval of the array elements that are equal to $k$. To check whether $k$ is present in the array it's enough to find its lower bound and check if the corresponding element equates to $k$.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    The explanation above provides a rough description of the algorithm. For the implementation details, we'd need to be more precise.\n\n    We will maintain a pair $L < R$ such that $A_L \\leq k < A_R$. Meaning that the active search interval is $[L, R)$. We use half-interval here instead of a segment $[L, R]$ as it turns out to require less corner case work.\n\n    When $R = L+1$, we can deduce from definitions above that $R$ is the upper bound of $k$. It is convenient to initialize $R$ with past-the-end index, that is $R=n$ and $L$ with before-the-beginning index, that is $L=-1$. It is fine as long as we never evaluate $A_L$ and $A_R$ in our algorithm directly, formally treating it as $A_L = -\\infty$ and $A_R = +\\infty$.\n\n    Finally, to be specific about the value of $M$ we pick, we will stick with $M = \\lfloor \\frac{L+R}{2} \\rfloor$.\n\n    Then the implementation could look like this:\n\n    ```cpp\n    ... // a sorted array is stored as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]\n    int l = -1, r = n;\n    while(r - l > 1) {\n        int m = (l + r) / 2;\n        if(k < a[m]) {\n            r = m; // a[l] <= k < a[m] <= a[r]\n        } else {\n            l = m; // a[l] <= a[m] <= k < a[r]\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    During the execution of the algorithm, we never evaluate neither $A_L$ nor $A_R$, as $L < M < R$. In the end, $L$ will be the index of the last element that is not greater than $k$ (or $-1$ if there is no such element) and $R$ will be the index of the first element larger than $k$ (or $n$ if there is no such element).\n\n    ## Search on arbitrary predicate\n\n    Let $f : \\{0,1,\\dots, n-1\\} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ be a boolean function defined on $0,1,\\dots,n-1$ such that it is monotonous, that is\n\n    $$\n    f(0) \\leq f(1) \\leq \\dots \\leq f(n-1).\n    $$\n\n    The binary search, the way it is described above, finds the partition of the array by the predicate $f(M)$, holding the boolean value of $k < A_M$ expression. In other words, binary search finds the unique index $L$ such that $f(L) = 0$ and $f(R)=f(L+1)=1$.\n\n    It is possible to use arbitrary monotonous predicate instead of $k < A_M$. It is particularly useful when the computation of $f(k)$ is requires too much time to actually compute it for every possible value.\n\n    ```cpp\n    ... // f(i) is a boolean function such that f(0) <= ... <= f(n-1)\n    int l = -1, r = n;\n    while(r - l > 1) {\n        int m = (l + r) / 2;\n        if(f(m)) {\n            r = m; // 0 = f(l) < f(m) = 1\n        } else {\n            l = m; // 0 = f(m) < f(r) = 1\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Binary search\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n\n    ### Binary search on the answer\n\n    Such situation often occurs when we're asked to compute some value, but we're only capable of checking whether this value is at least $i$. For example, you're given an array $a_1,\\dots,a_n$ and you're asked to find the maximum floored average sum\n\n    $$\n    \\left \\lfloor \\frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \\right\\rfloor\n    $$\n\n    among all possible pairs of $l,r$ such that $r-l \\geq x$. One of simple ways to solve this problem is to check whether the answer is at least $\\lambda$, that is if there is a pair $l, r$ such that the following is true:\n\n    $$\n    \\frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \\geq \\lambda.\n    $$\n\n    Equivalently, it rewrites as\n\n    $$\n    (a_l - \\lambda) + (a_{l+1} - \\lambda) + \\dots + (a_r - \\lambda) \\geq 0,\n    $$\n\n    so now we need to check whether there is a subarray of a new array $a_i - \\lambda$ of length at least $x+1$ with non-negative sum, which is doable with some prefix sums.\n\n    ## Continuous search\n\n    Let $f : \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R$ be a real-valued function that is continuous on a segment $[L, R]$.\n\n    Without loss of generality assume that $f(L) \\leq f(R)$. From [intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem) it follows that for any $y \\in [f(L), f(R)]$ there is $x \\in [L, R]$ such that $f(x) = y$. Note that, unlike previous paragraphs, the function is _not_ required to be monotonous.\n\n    The value $x$ could be approximated up to $\\pm\\delta$ in $O\\left(\\log \\frac{R-L}{\\delta}\\right)$ time for any specific value of $\\delta$. The idea is essentially the same, if we take $M \\in (L, R)$ then we would be able to reduce the search interval to either $[L, M]$ or $[M, R]$ depending on whether $f(M)$ is larger than $y$. One common example here would be finding roots of odd-degree polynomials.\n\n    For example, let $f(x)=x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. Then $f(L) \\to -\\infty$ and $f(R) \\to +\\infty$ with $L \\to -\\infty$ and $R \\to +\\infty$. Which means that it is always possible to find sufficiently small $L$ and sufficiently large $R$ such that $f(L) < 0$ and $f(R) > 0$. Then, it is possible to find with binary search arbitrarily small interval containing $x$ such that $f(x)=0$.\n\n    ## Search with powers of 2\n\n    Another noteworthy way to do binary search is, instead of maintaining an active segment, to maintain the current pointer $i$ and the current power $k$. The pointer starts at $i=L$ and then on each iteration one tests the predicate at point $i+2^k$. If the predicate is still $0$, the pointer is advanced from $i$ to $i+2^k$, otherwise it stays the same, then the power $k$ is decreased by $1$.\n\n    This paradigm is widely used in tasks around trees, such as finding lowest common ancestor of two vertices or finding an ancestor of a specific vertex that has a certain height. It could also be adapted to e.g. find the $k$-th non-zero element in a Fenwick tree.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Amortized analysis\n    Section: Two pointers method\n    Part: 2/2\n    $ steps.\n\n    Note that it is possible to solve the problem\n    in another way in $O(n \\log n)$ time using binary search.\n    In such a solution, we iterate through the array\n    and for each array value, we try to find another\n    value that yields the sum $x$.\n    This can be done by performing $n$ binary searches,\n    each of which takes $O(\\log n)$ time.\n\n    \\index{3SUM problem}\n    A more difficult problem is \n    the \\key{3SUM problem} that asks to\n    find \\emph{three} array values\n    whose sum is $x$.\n    Using the idea of the above algorithm,\n    this problem can be solved in $O(n^2)$ time\\footnote{For a long time,\n    it was thought that solving\n    the 3SUM problem more efficiently than in $O(n^2)$ time\n    would not be possible.\n    However, in 2014, it turned out \\cite{gro14}\n    that this is not the case.}.\n    Can you see how?\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
