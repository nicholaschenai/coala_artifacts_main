    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list and an integer L, and splits the list into two parts. The first part should contain the first L elements of the list, and the second part should contain the remaining elements. The function should return these two parts as a tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Take the input list and the integer L.\n   - Use slicing to create the first part of the list, which consists of the first L elements.\n   - Create the second part of the list by taking the elements from index L to the end of the list.\n   - Return both parts as a tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function split_two_parts(list, L):\n       first_part = list[0:L]  // Get the first L elements\n       second_part = list[L:]   // Get the elements from index L to the end\n       return (first_part, second_part)  // Return both parts as a tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef split_two_parts(lst, L):\n    # Get the first part of the list containing the first L elements\n    first_part = lst[0:L]\n    # Get the second part of the list containing the elements from index L to the end\n    second_part = lst[L:]\n    # Return both parts as a tuple\n    return (first_part, second_part)\n```",
