INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/262 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer L. The function should split the list into two parts: the first part should contain the first L elements of the list, and the second part should contain the remaining elements. The function should return these two parts as a tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Take the input list and the integer L.
   - Use slicing to create the first part of the list, which will include the first L elements.
   - The second part will be the remainder of the list, starting from the L-th index to the end.
   - Finally, we will return both parts as a tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function split_two_parts(list, L):
       first_part = list[0:L]  // Get the first L elements
       second_part = list[L:]   // Get the elements from index L to the end
       return (first_part, second_part)  // Return the two parts as a tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def split_two_parts(lst, L):
    # Get the first part of the list containing the first L elements
    first_part = lst[0:L]
    # Get the second part of the list containing the elements from index L to the end
    second_part = lst[L:]
    # Return both parts as a tuple

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m 
            def mod_min(r, n, m):

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list and an integer L, and splits the list into two parts. The first part should contain the first L elements of the list, and the second part should contain the remaining elements. The function should return these two parts as a tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Take the input list and the integer L.
   - Use slicing to create the first part of the list, which consists of the first L elements.
   - Create the second part of the list by taking the elements from index L to the end of the list.
   - Return both parts as a tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function split_two_parts(list, L):
       first_part = list[0:L]  // Get the first L elements
       second_part = list[L:]   // Get the elements from index L to the end
       return (first_part, second_part)  // Return both parts as a tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def split_two_parts(lst, L):
    # Get the first part of the list containing the first L elements
    first_part = lst[0:L]
    # Get the second part of the list containing the elements from index L to the end
    second_part = lst[L:]
    # Return both parts as a tuple
    return (first_part, second_part)
```
