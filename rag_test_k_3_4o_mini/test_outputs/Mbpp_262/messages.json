Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.\n\n        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \\equiv qr \\pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \\equiv p_2 q_1 \\pmod m$. Assuming that $\\frac{p_1}{q_1} \\neq \\frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.\n\n        In the statement we were told that $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \\leq p, q \\leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.\n\n        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr \\;\\bmod\\; m \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \\bmod m$ for $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$.\n\n        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^9$ and $\\frac{r}{m} q - k \\geq 0$ is the minimum possible.\n\n        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\\frac{r}{m}$.\n\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m \n            def mod_min(r, n, m):\n                a = fraction(r, m)\n                p, q = convergents(a)\n                for i in range(2, len(q)):\n                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):\n                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]\n                        return q[i-1] + t*q[i]\n            ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
