INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/474 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string and replaces all occurrences of a specified character with another character.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we will check if it matches the character we want to replace. If it does, we will add the new character to our result; if it doesn't, we will add the original character. Finally, we will join all the characters together to form the new string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function replace_char(input_string, char_to_replace, new_char):
       create an empty list to hold the result
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is equal to char_to_replace:
               append new_char to the result list
           else:
               append character to the result list
       join the result list into a string
       return the new string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def replace_char(input_string: str, char_to_replace: str, new_char: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty list to hold the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character matches the one to replace
        if char == char_to_replace:
            # Append the new character to the result list
            result.append(new_char)
        else:
            # Append the original character to the result list
            result.append(char)
    
    # Join the result list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(result)

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    Part: 1/1
    \section{Edit distance}

    \index{edit distance}
    \index{Levenshtein distance}

    The \key{edit distance} or \key{Levenshtein distance}\footnote{The distance
    is named after V. I. Levenshtein who studied it in connection with binary codes \cite{lev66}.}
    is the minimum number of editing operations
    needed to transform a string
    into another string.
    The allowed editing operations are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item insert a character (e.g. \texttt{ABC} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{ABCA})
    \item remove a character (e.g. \texttt{ABC} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{AC})
    \item modify a character (e.g. \texttt{ABC} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{ADC})
    \end{itemize}

    For example, the edit distance between
    \texttt{LOVE} and \texttt{MOVIE} is 2,
    because we can first perform the operation
     \texttt{LOVE} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{MOVE}
    (modify) and then the operation
    \texttt{MOVE} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{MOVIE}
    (insert).
    This is the smallest possible number of operations,
    because it is clear that only one operation is not enough.

    Suppose that we are given a string \texttt{x}
    of length $n$ and a string \texttt{y} of length $m$,
    and we want to calculate the edit distance between
    \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}.
    To solve the problem, we define a function
    $\texttt{distance}(a,b)$ that gives the
    edit distance between prefixes
    $\texttt{x}[0 \ldots a]$ and $\texttt{y}[0 \ldots b]$.
    Thus, using this function, the edit distance
    between \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} equals $\texttt{distance}(n-1,m-1)$.

    We can calculate values of \texttt{distance}
    as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \texttt{distance}(a,b) = \min(& \texttt{distance}(a,b-1)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{distance}(a-1,b)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{distance}(a-1,b-1)+\texttt{cost}(a,b)).
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    Here $\texttt{cost}(a,b)=0$ if $\texttt{x}[a]=\texttt{y}[b]$,
    and otherwise $\texttt{cost}(a,b)=1$.
    The formula considers the following ways to
    edit the string \texttt{x}:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\texttt{distance}(a,b-1)$: insert a character at the end of \texttt{x}
    \item $\texttt{distance}(a-1,b)$: remove the last character from \texttt{x}
    \item $\texttt{distance}(a-1,b-1)$: match or modify the last character of \texttt{x}
    \end{itemize}
    In the two first cases, one editing operation is needed
    (insert or remove).
    In the last case, if $\texttt{x}[a]=\texttt{y}[b]$,
    we can match the last characters without editing,
    and otherwise one editing operation is needed (modify).

    The following table shows the values of \texttt{distance}
    in the example case:

    The lower-right corner of the table
    tells us that the edit distance between
    \texttt{LOVE} and \texttt{MOVIE} is 2.
    The table also shows how to construct
    the shortest sequence of editing operations.

    The last characters of \texttt{LOVE} and \texttt{MOVIE}
    are equal, so the edit distance between them
    equals the edit distance between \texttt{LOV} and \texttt{MOVI}.
    We can use one editing operation to remove the
    character \texttt{I} from \texttt{MOVI}.
    Thus, the edit distance is one larger than
    the edit distance between \texttt{LOV} and \texttt{MOV}, etc.

    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{String algorithms}

    This chapter deals with efficient algorithms
    for string processing.
    Many string problems can be easily solved
    in $O(n^2)$ time, but the challenge is to
    find algorithms that work in $O(n)$ or $O(n \log n)$
    time.

    \index{pattern matching}

    For example, a fundamental string processing
    problem is the \key{pattern matching} problem:
    given a string of length $n$ and a pattern of length $m$,
    our task is to find the occurrences of the pattern
    in the string.
    For example, the pattern \texttt{ABC} occurs two
    times in the string \texttt{ABABCBABC}.

    The pattern matching problem can be easily solved
    in $O(nm)$ time by a brute force algorithm that
    tests all positions where the pattern may
    occur in the string.
    However, in this chapter, we will see that there
    are more efficient algorithms that require only
    $O(n+m)$ time.

    \index{string}

    \section{String terminology}

    \index{alphabet}

    Throughout the chapter, we assume that
    zero-based indexing is used in strings.
    Thus, a string \texttt{s} of length $n$
    consists of characters
    $\texttt{s}[0],\texttt{s}[1],\ldots,\texttt{s}[n-1]$.
    The set of characters that may appear
    in strings is called an \key{alphabet}.
    For example, the alphabet
    $\{\texttt{A},\texttt{B},\ldots,\texttt{Z}\}$
    consists of the capital letters of English.

    \index{substring}

    A \key{substring} is a sequence of consecutive
    characters in a string.
    We use the notation $\texttt{s}[a \ldots b]$
    to refer to a substring of \texttt{s}
    that begins at position $a$ and ends at position $b$.
    A string of length $n$ has $n(n+1)/2$ substrings.
    For example, the substrings of
    \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}, \texttt{D},
    \texttt{AB}, \texttt{BC}, \texttt{CD},
    \texttt{ABC}, \texttt{BCD} and \texttt{ABCD}.

    \index{subsequence}

    A \key{subsequence} is a sequence of
    (not necessarily consecutive) characters
    in a string in their original order.
    A string of length $n$ has $2^n-1$ subsequences.
    For example, the subsequences of
    \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}, \texttt{D},
    \texttt{AB}, \texttt{AC}, \texttt{AD},
    \texttt{BC}, \texttt{BD}, \texttt{CD},
    \texttt{ABC}, \texttt{ABD}, \texttt{ACD},
    \texttt{BCD} and \texttt{ABCD}.

    \index{prefix}
    \index{suffix}

    A \key{prefix} is a substring that starts at the beginning
    of a string,
    and a \key{suffix} is a substring that ends at the end
    of a string.
    For example,
    the prefixes of \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{A}, \texttt{AB}, \texttt{ABC} and \texttt{ABCD},
    and the suffixes of \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{D}, \texttt{CD}, \texttt{BCD} and \texttt{ABCD}.

    \index{rotation}

    A \key{rotation} can be generated by moving
    the characters of a string one by one from the beginning
    to the end (or vice versa).
    For example, the rotations of \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{ABCD}, \texttt{BCDA}, \texttt{CDAB} and \texttt{DABC}.

    \index{period}

    A \key{period} is a prefix of a string such that
    the string can be constructed by repeating the period.
    The last repetition may be partial and contain
    only a prefix of the period.
    For example, the shortest period of
    \texttt{ABCABCA} is \texttt{ABC}.

    \index{border}

    A \key{border} is a string that is both
    a prefix and a suffix of a string.
    For example, the borders of \texttt{ABACABA}
    are \texttt{A}, \texttt{ABA} and \texttt{ABACABA}.

    \index{lexicographical order}

    Strings are compared using the \key{lexicographical order}
    (which corresponds to the alphabetical order).
    It means that $x<y$ if either $x \neq y$ and $x$ is a prefix of $y$,
    or there is a position $k$ such that
    $x[i]=y[i]$ when $i<k$ and $x[k]<y[k]$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/474 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that replaces all occurrences of a specified character in a given string with another character. For example, if we have the string "polygon" and we want to replace 'y' with 'l', the result should be "pollgon".

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we check if it matches the character we want to replace. If it does, we append the new character to a result string; if it doesn't, we append the original character. Finally, we return the result string after processing all characters.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function replace_char(input_string, char_to_replace, new_char):
       create an empty result string
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is equal to char_to_replace:
               append new_char to result string
           else:
               append character to result string
       return result string
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def replace_char(input_string: str, char_to_replace: str, new_char: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty result string
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the current character is the one to replace
        if char == char_to_replace:
            # Append the new character to the result
            result += new_char
        else:
            # Append the original character to the result
            result += char
