    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a tuple of integers and converts it into a dictionary. The dictionary should use pairs of adjacent elements from the tuple as key-value pairs. For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 5)`, the output should be a dictionary where `1` is the key and `5` is the value, `7` is the key and `10` is the value, and `13` is the key and `5` is the value.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the tuple in steps of two. For each pair of elements, we will take the first element as the key and the second element as the value and add them to a dictionary. We will continue this until we reach the end of the tuple. If the tuple has an odd number of elements, the last element will be ignored since it does not have a pair.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function tuple_to_dict(input_tuple):\n       create an empty dictionary\n       for i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 1 with step 2:\n           if i + 1 is less than length of input_tuple:\n               add input_tuple[i] as key and input_tuple[i + 1] as value to the dictionary\n       return the dictionary\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef tuple_to_dict(input_tuple):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store the key-value pairs\n    result_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through the tuple in steps of 2\n    for i in range(0, len(input_tuple) - 1, 2):\n        # Add the current element as key and the next element as value\n        result_dict[input_tuple[i]] = input_tuple[i + 1]\n    \n    # Return the constructed dictionary\n    return result_dict\n```",
