    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given number can be expressed as a sum of non-zero powers of 2. This means we want to determine if the number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (like 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: \n   A number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 if its binary representation contains only 1s and 0s. Each bit in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2. If a bit is set (1), it means that power of 2 is included in the sum. Therefore, we can check if the number is greater than 0 and if it can be expressed in binary without any restrictions.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   - Define a function `is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n)` that takes an integer `n`.\n   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, return `False` (since we cannot have a sum of powers of 2 that results in a non-positive number).\n   - Use a loop to check if `n` can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2:\n     - While `n` is greater than 0:\n       - Check if the least significant bit (LSB) is set (i.e., `n & 1`).\n       - If it is, we can include that power of 2 in our sum.\n       - Right shift `n` by 1 to check the next bit.\n     - If we finish the loop without issues, return `True`.\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is positive\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    \n    # Loop to check the bits of the number\n    while n > 0:\n        # Check if the least significant bit is set\n        if n & 1:\n            # If it is set, we can include this power of 2\n            pass\n        # Right shift to check the next bit\n        n >>= 1\n    \n    # If we have processed all bits, return True\n    return True\n```",
