    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a Python function that determines whether a given number is not a prime number. The function should return `True` for non-prime numbers and `False` for prime numbers. The function must be named `is_not_prime`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To identify non-prime numbers, we need to check if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, if a number is less than 2, it is not prime. For numbers greater than or equal to 2, we can check for divisibility by all integers from 2 up to the square root of the number. If we find any divisor in this range, the number is not prime.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_not_prime(n):\n       if n < 2:\n           return True  // 0 and 1 are not prime\n       for i from 2 to sqrt(n):\n           if n % i == 0:\n               return True  // n is divisible by i, hence not prime\n       return False  // n is prime\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_not_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is less than 2\n    if n < 2:\n        return True  # 0 and 1 are not prime numbers\n    # Check for factors from 2 to the square root of n\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return True  # Found a divisor, hence n is not prime\n    return False  # No divisors found, hence n is prime\n```",
