Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n \t\n    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.\n\n    Examples:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 01010000\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n | (n-1) = 01011111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    --------------------\n    ~n        = 10100111\n    ```\n\n    ### Shift operators\n\n    There are two operators for shifting bits.\n\n    -   $\\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.\n        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\gg 2 = 101_2 \\gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\\frac{5}{2^2} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1$.\n        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.\n\n    -   $\\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.\n        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\ll 3 = 101_2 \\ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \\cdot 2^3 = 5 \\cdot 8 = 40$.\n\n        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.\n\n\n    ## Useful tricks\n\n    ### Set/flip/clear a bit\n\n    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.\n    $1 \\ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\\sim(1 \\ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.\n\n    - $n ~|~ (1 \\ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\wedge~ (1 \\ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\&~ \\sim(1 \\ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n\n    ### Check if a bit is set\n\n    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {\n        return (number >> x) & 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2\n\n    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).\n    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.\n    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {\n        return n && !(n & (n - 1));\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Clear the most-right set bit\n\n    The expression $n ~\\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.\n    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.\n    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.\n\n    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 00110100\n    n-1       = 00110011\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 00110000\n    ```\n\n    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm\n\n    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.\n\n    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    int countSetBits(int n)\n    {\n        int count = 0;\n        while (n)\n        {\n            n = n & (n - 1);\n            count++;\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Binary search\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n\n    ### Binary search on the answer\n\n    Such situation often occurs when we're asked to compute some value, but we're only capable of checking whether this value is at least $i$. For example, you're given an array $a_1,\\dots,a_n$ and you're asked to find the maximum floored average sum\n\n    $$\n    \\left \\lfloor \\frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \\right\\rfloor\n    $$\n\n    among all possible pairs of $l,r$ such that $r-l \\geq x$. One of simple ways to solve this problem is to check whether the answer is at least $\\lambda$, that is if there is a pair $l, r$ such that the following is true:\n\n    $$\n    \\frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \\dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \\geq \\lambda.\n    $$\n\n    Equivalently, it rewrites as\n\n    $$\n    (a_l - \\lambda) + (a_{l+1} - \\lambda) + \\dots + (a_r - \\lambda) \\geq 0,\n    $$\n\n    so now we need to check whether there is a subarray of a new array $a_i - \\lambda$ of length at least $x+1$ with non-negative sum, which is doable with some prefix sums.\n\n    ## Continuous search\n\n    Let $f : \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R$ be a real-valued function that is continuous on a segment $[L, R]$.\n\n    Without loss of generality assume that $f(L) \\leq f(R)$. From [intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem) it follows that for any $y \\in [f(L), f(R)]$ there is $x \\in [L, R]$ such that $f(x) = y$. Note that, unlike previous paragraphs, the function is _not_ required to be monotonous.\n\n    The value $x$ could be approximated up to $\\pm\\delta$ in $O\\left(\\log \\frac{R-L}{\\delta}\\right)$ time for any specific value of $\\delta$. The idea is essentially the same, if we take $M \\in (L, R)$ then we would be able to reduce the search interval to either $[L, M]$ or $[M, R]$ depending on whether $f(M)$ is larger than $y$. One common example here would be finding roots of odd-degree polynomials.\n\n    For example, let $f(x)=x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. Then $f(L) \\to -\\infty$ and $f(R) \\to +\\infty$ with $L \\to -\\infty$ and $R \\to +\\infty$. Which means that it is always possible to find sufficiently small $L$ and sufficiently large $R$ such that $f(L) < 0$ and $f(R) > 0$. Then, it is possible to find with binary search arbitrarily small interval containing $x$ such that $f(x)=0$.\n\n    ## Search with powers of 2\n\n    Another noteworthy way to do binary search is, instead of maintaining an active segment, to maintain the current pointer $i$ and the current power $k$. The pointer starts at $i=L$ and then on each iteration one tests the predicate at point $i+2^k$. If the predicate is still $0$, the pointer is advanced from $i$ to $i+2^k$, otherwise it stays the same, then the power $k$ is decreased by $1$.\n\n    This paradigm is widely used in tasks around trees, such as finding lowest common ancestor of two vertices or finding an ancestor of a specific vertex that has a certain height. It could also be adapted to e.g. find the $k$-th non-zero element in a Fenwick tree.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

This way, finding the maximum difference between the number of '0's and '1's in a substring translates to finding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in this transformed array. We can use a variation of Kadane's algorithm to efficiently find this maximum sum.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_length(binary_string):\n       Initialize max_diff to 0\n       Initialize current_sum to 0\n       \n       for each character in binary_string:\n           if character is '0':\n               current_sum += 1\n           else:\n               current_sum -= 1\n           \n           if current_sum > max_diff:\n               max_diff = current_sum\n           \n           if current_sum < 0:\n               current_sum = 0\n       \n       return max_diff\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_length(binary_string: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum difference and current sum\n    max_diff = 0\n    current_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the binary string\n    for char in binary_string:\n        # Treat '0' as +1 and '1' as -1\n        if char == '0':\n            current_sum += 1\n        else:\n            current_sum -= 1\n        \n        # Update max_diff if current_sum is greater\n        if current_sum > max_diff:\n            max_diff = current_sum\n        \n        # Reset current_sum if it drops below 0\n        if current_sum < 0:\n            current_sum = 0\n    \n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_diff\n```"
