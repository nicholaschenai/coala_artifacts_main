    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a binary string (composed of '0's and '1's) and finds the maximum difference between the count of '0's and '1's in any substring of that binary string.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we can transform the binary string into a numerical representation where '0' is treated as +1 and '1' is treated as -1. This way, finding the maximum difference between the number of '0's and '1's in a substring translates to finding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in this transformed array. We can use a variation of Kadane's algorithm to efficiently find this maximum sum.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_length(binary_string):\n       Initialize max_diff to 0\n       Initialize current_sum to 0\n       \n       for each character in binary_string:\n           if character is '0':\n               current_sum += 1\n           else:\n               current_sum -= 1\n           \n           if current_sum > max_diff:\n               max_diff = current_sum\n           \n           if current_sum < 0:\n               current_sum = 0\n       \n       return max_diff\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_length(binary_string: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum difference and current sum\n    max_diff = 0\n    current_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the binary string\n    for char in binary_string:\n        # Treat '0' as +1 and '1' as -1\n        if char == '0':\n            current_sum += 1\n        else:\n            current_sum -= 1\n        \n        # Update max_diff if current_sum is greater\n        if current_sum > max_diff:\n            max_diff = current_sum\n        \n        # Reset current_sum if it drops below 0\n        if current_sum < 0:\n            current_sum = 0\n    \n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_diff\n```",
