INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/125 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a binary string (a string made up of '0's and '1's) and finds the maximum difference between the count of '0's and '1's in any substring of that binary string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through all possible substrings of the given binary string. For each substring, we will count the number of '0's and '1's, calculate the difference between these counts, and keep track of the maximum difference found. The difference can be calculated as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_length(binary_string):
       max_difference = 0
       for start_index from 0 to length of binary_string - 1:
           for end_index from start_index to length of binary_string:
               substring = binary_string[start_index:end_index]
               count_0 = count of '0's in substring
               count_1 = count of '1's in substring
               difference = count_0 - count_1
               if difference > max_difference:
                   max_difference = difference
       return max_difference
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_length(binary_string: str) -> int:
    # Initialize the maximum difference to 0
    max_difference = 0
    
    # Iterate over all possible starting points for substrings
    for start_index in range(len(binary_string)):
        # Initialize counts of '0's and '1's for the current substring
        count_0 = 0
        count_1 = 0
        
        # Iterate over all possible ending points for substrings
        for end_index in range(start_index, len(binary_string)):
            # Count '0's and '1's in the current substring
            if binary_string[end_index] == '0':
                count_0 += 1
            else:
                count_1 += 1
            
            # Calculate the difference between counts of '0's and '1's
            difference = count_0 - count_1
            
            # Update the maximum difference if the current one is greater
            if difference > max_difference:
                max_difference = difference

    Chapter: Bit manipulation
    Section: Bit optimizations
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Bit optimizations}

    Many algorithms can be optimized using
    bit operations.
    Such optimizations do not change the
    time complexity of the algorithm,
    but they may have a large impact
    on the actual running time of the code.
    In this section we discuss examples
    of such situations.

    \subsubsection{Hamming distances}

    \index{Hamming distance}
    The \key{Hamming distance}
    $\texttt{hamming}(a,b)$ between two
    strings $a$ and $b$ of equal length is
    the number of positions where the strings differ.
    For example,
    \[\texttt{hamming}(01101,11001)=2.\]

    Consider the following problem: Given
    a list of $n$ bit strings, each of length $k$,
    calculate the minimum Hamming distance
    between two strings in the list.
    For example, the answer for $[00111,01101,11110]$
    is 2, because
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item $\texttt{hamming}(00111,01101)=2$,
    \item $\texttt{hamming}(00111,11110)=3$, and
    \item $\texttt{hamming}(01101,11110)=3$.
    \end{itemize}

    A straightforward way to solve the problem is
    to go through all pairs of strings and calculate
    their Hamming distances,
    which yields an $O(n^2 k)$ time algorithm.
    The following function can be used to
    calculate distances:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int hamming(string a, string b) {
        int d = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (a[i] != b[i]) d++;
        }
        return d;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    However, if $k$ is small, we can optimize the code
    by storing the bit strings as integers and
    calculating the Hamming distances using bit operations.
    In particular, if $k \le 32$, we can just store
    the strings as \texttt{int} values and use the
    following function to calculate distances:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int hamming(int a, int b) {
        return __builtin_popcount(a^b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    In the above function, the xor operation constructs
    a bit string that has one bits in positions
    where $a$ and $b$ differ.
    Then, the number of bits is calculated using
    the \texttt{\_\_builtin\_popcount} function.

    To compare the implementations, we generated
    a list of 10000 random bit strings of length 30.
    Using the first approach, the search took
    13.5 seconds, and after the bit optimization,
    it only took 0.5 seconds.
    Thus, the bit optimized code was almost
    30 times faster than the original code.

    \subsubsection{Counting subgrids}

    As another example, consider the
    following problem:
    Given an $n \times n$ grid whose
    each square is either black (1) or white (0),
    calculate the number of subgrids
    whose all corners are black.
    For example, the grid
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \fill[black] (1,1) rectangle (2,2);
    \fill[black] (1,4) rectangle (2,5);
    \fill[black] (4,1) rectangle (5,2);
    \fill[black] (4,4) rectangle (5,5);
    \fill[black] (1,3) rectangle (2,4);
    \fill[black] (2,3) rectangle (3,4);
    \fill[black] (2,1) rectangle (3,2);
    \fill[black] (0,2) rectangle (1,3);
    \draw (0,0) grid (5,5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    contains two such subgrids:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \fill[black] (1,1) rectangle (2,2);
    \fill[black] (1,4) rectangle (2,5);
    \fill[black] (4,1) rectangle (5,2);
    \fill[black] (4,4) rectangle (5,5);
    \fill[black] (1,3) rectangle (2,4);
    \fill[black] (2,3) rectangle (3,4);
    \fill[black] (2,1) rectangle (3,2);
    \fill[black] (0,2) rectangle (1,3);
    \draw (0,0) grid (5,5);

    \fill[black] (7+1,1) rectangle (7+2,2);
    \fill[black] (7+1,4) rectangle (7+2,5);
    \fill[black] (7+4,1) rectangle (7+5,2);
    \fill[black] (7+4,4) rectangle (7+5,5);
    \fill[black] (7+1,3) rectangle (7+2,4);
    \fill[black] (7+2,3) rectangle (7+3,4);
    \fill[black] (7+2,1) rectangle (7+3,2);
    \fill[black] (7+0,2) rectangle (7+1,3);
    \draw (7+0,0) grid (7+5,5);

    \draw[color=red,line width=1mm] (1,1) rectangle (3,4);
    \draw[color=red,line width=1mm] (7+1,1) rectangle (7+5,5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    There is an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm for solving the problem:
    go through all $O(n^2)$ pairs of rows and for each pair
    $(a,b)$ calculate the number of columns that contain a black
    square in both rows in $O(n)$ time.
    The following code assumes that $\texttt{color}[y][x]$
    denotes the color in row $y$ and column $x$:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (color[a][i] == 1 && color[b][i] == 1) count++;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    Then, those columns
    account for $\texttt{count}(\texttt{count}-1)/2$ subgrids with black corners,
    because we can choose any two of them to form a subgrid.

    To optimize this algorithm, we divide the grid into blocks
    of columns such that each block consists of $N$
    consecutive columns. Then, each row is stored as
    a list of $N$-bit numbers that describe the colors
    of the squares. Now we can process $N$ columns at the same time
    using bit operations. In the following code,
    $\texttt{color}[y][k]$ represents
    a block of $N$ colors as bits.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n/N; i++) {
        count += __builtin_popcount(color[a][i]&color[b][i]);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    The resulting algorithm works in $O(n^3/N)$ time.

    We generated a random grid of size $2500 \times 2500$
    and compared the original and bit optimized implementation.
    While the original code took $29.6$ seconds,
    the bit optimized version only took $3.1$ seconds
    with $N=32$ (\texttt{int} numbers) and $1.7$ seconds
    with $N=64$ (\texttt{long long} numbers).

    # Bit manipulation

    ## Binary number

    A **binary number** is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, it is a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).

    We say that a certain bit is **set**, if it is one, and **cleared** if it is zero.

    The binary number $(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2$ represents the number:

    $$(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2 = a_k \cdot 2^k + a_{k-1} \cdot 2^{k-1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot 2^1 + a_0 \cdot 2^0.$$

    For instance the binary number $1101_2$ represents the number $13$:

    $$\begin{align}
    1101_2 &= 1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 \\
           &= 1\cdot 8 + 1 \cdot 4 + 0 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 = 13
    \end{align}$$

    Computers represent integers as binary numbers.
    Positive integers (both signed and unsigned) are just represented with their binary digits, and negative signed numbers (which can be positive and negative) are usually represented with the [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).

    ```cpp
    unsigned int unsigned_number = 13;
    assert(unsigned_number == 0b1101);

    int positive_signed_number = 13;
    assert(positive_signed_number == 0b1101);

    int negative_signed_number = -13;
    assert(negative_signed_number == 0b1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'0011);
    ```

    CPUs are very fast manipulating those bits with specific operations.
    For some problems we can take these binary number representations to our advantage, and speed up the execution time.
    And for some problems (typically in combinatorics or dynamic programming) where we want to track which objects we already picked from a given set of objects, we can just use an large enough integer where each digit represents an object and depending on if we pick or drop the object we set or clear the digit.

    ## Bit operators

    All those introduced operators are instant (same speed as an addition) on a CPU for fixed-length integers.

    ### Bitwise operators

    -   $\&$ : The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand. 
        If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.
 	
    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.

    Examples:

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 01010000
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n | (n-1) = 01011111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    --------------------
    ~n        = 10100111
    ```

    ### Shift operators

    There are two operators for shifting bits.

    -   $\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.
        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \gg 2 = 101_2 \gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\frac{5}{2^2} = \frac{5}{4} = 1$.
        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.

    -   $\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.
        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \ll 3 = 101_2 \ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \cdot 2^3 = 5 \cdot 8 = 40$.

        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.


    ## Useful tricks

    ### Set/flip/clear a bit

    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.
    $1 \ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\sim(1 \ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.

    - $n ~|~ (1 \ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\wedge~ (1 \ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\&~ \sim(1 \ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$

    ### Check if a bit is set

    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.

    ``` cpp
    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {
        return (number >> x) & 1;
    }
    ```

    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2

    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).
    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.
    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.

    ``` cpp
    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {
        return n && !(n & (n - 1));
    }
    ```

    ### Clear the most-right set bit

    The expression $n ~\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.
    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.
    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.

    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:

    ```
    n         = 00110100
    n-1       = 00110011
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 00110000
    ```

    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm

    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.

    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.

    ``` cpp
    int countSetBits(int n)
    {
        int count = 0;
        while (n)
        {
            n = n & (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    Title: Binary search
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    ### Binary search on the answer

    Such situation often occurs when we're asked to compute some value, but we're only capable of checking whether this value is at least $i$. For example, you're given an array $a_1,\dots,a_n$ and you're asked to find the maximum floored average sum

    $$
    \left \lfloor \frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \right\rfloor
    $$

    among all possible pairs of $l,r$ such that $r-l \geq x$. One of simple ways to solve this problem is to check whether the answer is at least $\lambda$, that is if there is a pair $l, r$ such that the following is true:

    $$
    \frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \geq \lambda.
    $$

    Equivalently, it rewrites as

    $$
    (a_l - \lambda) + (a_{l+1} - \lambda) + \dots + (a_r - \lambda) \geq 0,
    $$

    so now we need to check whether there is a subarray of a new array $a_i - \lambda$ of length at least $x+1$ with non-negative sum, which is doable with some prefix sums.

    ## Continuous search

    Let $f : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be a real-valued function that is continuous on a segment $[L, R]$.

    Without loss of generality assume that $f(L) \leq f(R)$. From [intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem) it follows that for any $y \in [f(L), f(R)]$ there is $x \in [L, R]$ such that $f(x) = y$. Note that, unlike previous paragraphs, the function is _not_ required to be monotonous.

    The value $x$ could be approximated up to $\pm\delta$ in $O\left(\log \frac{R-L}{\delta}\right)$ time for any specific value of $\delta$. The idea is essentially the same, if we take $M \in (L, R)$ then we would be able to reduce the search interval to either $[L, M]$ or $[M, R]$ depending on whether $f(M)$ is larger than $y$. One common example here would be finding roots of odd-degree polynomials.

    For example, let $f(x)=x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. Then $f(L) \to -\infty$ and $f(R) \to +\infty$ with $L \to -\infty$ and $R \to +\infty$. Which means that it is always possible to find sufficiently small $L$ and sufficiently large $R$ such that $f(L) < 0$ and $f(R) > 0$. Then, it is possible to find with binary search arbitrarily small interval containing $x$ such that $f(x)=0$.

    ## Search with powers of 2

    Another noteworthy way to do binary search is, instead of maintaining an active segment, to maintain the current pointer $i$ and the current power $k$. The pointer starts at $i=L$ and then on each iteration one tests the predicate at point $i+2^k$. If the predicate is still $0$, the pointer is advanced from $i$ to $i+2^k$, otherwise it stays the same, then the power $k$ is decreased by $1$.

    This paradigm is widely used in tasks around trees, such as finding lowest common ancestor of two vertices or finding an ancestor of a specific vertex that has a certain height. It could also be adapted to e.g. find the $k$-th non-zero element in a Fenwick tree.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/125 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a binary string (composed of '0's and '1's) and finds the maximum difference between the count of '0's and '1's in any substring of that binary string.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: 
   To solve this problem, we can transform the binary string into a numerical representation where '0' is treated as +1 and '1' is treated as -1. This way, finding the maximum difference between the number of '0's and '1's in a substring translates to finding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in this transformed array. We can use a variation of Kadane's algorithm to efficiently find this maximum sum.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function find_length(binary_string):
       Initialize max_diff to 0
       Initialize current_sum to 0
       
       for each character in binary_string:
           if character is '0':
               current_sum += 1
           else:
               current_sum -= 1
           
           if current_sum > max_diff:
               max_diff = current_sum
           
           if current_sum < 0:
               current_sum = 0
       
       return max_diff
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def find_length(binary_string: str) -> int:
    # Initialize the maximum difference and current sum
    max_diff = 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each character in the binary string
    for char in binary_string:
        # Treat '0' as +1 and '1' as -1
        if char == '0':
            current_sum += 1
        else:
            current_sum -= 1
        
        # Update max_diff if current_sum is greater
        if current_sum > max_diff:
            max_diff = current_sum
        
        # Reset current_sum if it drops below 0
        if current_sum < 0:
            current_sum = 0
    
    # Return the maximum difference found
    return max_diff
