    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to write a function that takes an array of integers (which can include both positive and negative numbers) and finds the maximum product that can be obtained from any contiguous subarray within that array.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the maximum product subarray, we can iterate through the array while keeping track of two values: the maximum product ending at the current position and the minimum product ending at the current position. The reason for tracking the minimum product is that a negative number multiplied by the minimum product can become the maximum product. At each step, we will update the maximum product found so far.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_subarray_product(arr):\n       if arr is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       max_product = arr[0]\n       min_product = arr[0]\n       result = arr[0]\n       \n       for each number in arr starting from the second element:\n           if number is negative:\n               swap max_product and min_product\n           \n           max_product = max(number, max_product * number)\n           min_product = min(number, min_product * number)\n           \n           result = max(result, max_product)\n       \n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_subarray_product(arr):\n    # Check if the array is empty\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Initialize the maximum product, minimum product, and result\n    max_product = arr[0]\n    min_product = arr[0]\n    result = arr[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through the array starting from the second element\n    for number in arr[1:]:\n        # If the current number is negative, swap max_product and min_product\n        if number < 0:\n            max_product, min_product = min_product, max_product\n        \n        # Update the max_product and min_product\n        max_product = max(number, max_product * number)\n        min_product = min(number, min_product * number)\n        \n        # Update the result with the maximum product found so far\n        result = max(result, max_product)\n    \n    return result\n```",
