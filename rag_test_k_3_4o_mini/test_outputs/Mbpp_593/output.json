    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes an IP address as a string and removes any leading zeros from each of the four octets in the address. For example, the input \"216.08.094.196\" should be transformed to \"216.8.94.196\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can split the input string by the dot (.) character to separate the four octets. Then, for each octet, we will convert it to an integer to remove any leading zeros. Finally, we will join the octets back together with dots to form the final IP address.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function removezero_ip(ip_address):\n       split the ip_address by '.' into a list of octets\n       for each octet in the list:\n           convert the octet to an integer (this removes leading zeros)\n       join the list of octets back into a string with '.' as the separator\n       return the resulting string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip_address: str) -> str:\n    # Split the IP address into its four octets\n    octets = ip_address.split('.')\n    \n    # Remove leading zeros by converting each octet to an integer\n    for i in range(len(octets)):\n        octets[i] = str(int(octets[i]))  # Convert to int and back to str to remove leading zeros\n    \n    # Join the octets back into a single string with '.' as the separator\n    return '.'.join(octets)\n\n```",
