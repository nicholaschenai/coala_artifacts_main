Initially we set $l = 0, r = 1$, which corresponds to the empty string.\n\n    So, we want to calculate $d_{odd}[i]$ for the next $i$, and all the previous values in $d_{odd}[]$ have been already calculated. We do the following:\n\n    * If $i$ is outside the current sub-palindrome, i. e. $i \\geq r$, we'll just launch the trivial algorithm.\n    \n        So we'll increase $d_{odd}[i]$ consecutively and check each time if the current rightmost substring $[i - d_{odd}[i]\\dots i + d_{odd}[i]]$ is a palindrome. When we find the first mismatch or meet the boundaries of $s$, we'll stop. In this case we've finally calculated $d_{odd}[i]$. After this, we must not forget to update $(l, r)$. $r$ should be updated in such a way that it represents the last index of the current rightmost sub-palindrome.\n\n    * Now consider the case when $i \\le r$. We'll try to extract some information from the already calculated values in $d_{odd}[]$. So, let's find the \"mirror\" position of $i$ in the sub-palindrome $(l, r)$, i.e. we'll get the position $j = l + (r - i)$, and we check the value of $d_{odd}[j]$. Because $j$ is the position symmetrical to $i$ with respect to $(l+r)/2$, we can **almost always** assign $d_{odd}[i] = d_{odd}[j]$. Illustration of this (palindrome around $j$ is actually \"copied\" into the palindrome around $i$):\n    \n        $$\n        \\ldots\\ \n        \\overbrace{\n            s_{l+1}\\ \\ldots\\ \n            \\underbrace{\n                s_{j-d_{odd}[j]+1}\\ \\ldots\\ s_j\\ \\ldots\\ s_{j+d_{odd}[j]-1}\\ \n            }_\\text{palindrome}\\ \n            \\ldots\\ \n            \\underbrace{\n                s_{i-d_{odd}[j]+1}\\ \\ldots\\ s_i\\ \\ldots\\ s_{i+d_{odd}[j]-1}\\ \n            }_\\text{palindrome}\\ \n            \\ldots\\ s_{r-1}\\ \n        }^\\text{palindrome}\\ \n        \\ldots\n        $$\n    \n        But there is a **tricky case** to be handled correctly: when the \"inner\" palindrome reaches the borders of the \"outer\" one, i. e. $j - d_{odd}[j] \\le l$ (or, which is the same, $i + d_{odd}[j] \\ge r$). Because the symmetry outside the \"outer\" palindrome is not guaranteed, just assigning $d_{odd}[i] = d_{odd}[j]$ will be incorrect: we do not have enough data to state that the palindrome in the position $i$ has the same length.\n    \n        Actually, we should restrict the length of our palindrome for now, i. e. assign $d_{odd}[i] = r - i$, to handle such situations correctly. After this we'll run the trivial algorithm which will try to increase $d_{odd}[i]$ while it's possible.\n    \n        Illustration of this case (the palindrome with center $j$ is restricted to fit the \"outer\" palindrome):\n    \n        $$\n        \\ldots\\ \n        \\overbrace{\n            \\underbrace{\n                s_{l+1}\\ \\ldots\\ s_j\\ \\ldots\\ s_{j+(j-l)-1}\\ \n            }_\\text{palindrome}\\ \n            \\ldots\\ \n            \\underbrace{\n                s_{i-(r-i)+1}\\ \\ldots\\ s_i\\ \\ldots\\ s_{r-1}\n            }_\\text{palindrome}\\ \n        }^\\text{palindrome}\\ \n        \\underbrace{\n            \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots\n        }_\\text{try moving here}\n        $$\n    \n        It is shown in the illustration that though the palindrome with center $j$ could be larger and go outside the \"outer\" palindrome, but with $i$ as the center we can use only the part that entirely fits into the \"outer\" palindrome. But the answer for the position $i$ ($d_{odd}[i]$) can be much bigger than this part, so next we'll run our trivial algorithm that will try to grow it outside our \"outer\" palindrome, i. e. to the region \"try moving here\".\n\n    Again, we should not forget to update the values $(l, r)$ after calculating each $d_{odd}[i]$.\n\n    ## Complexity of Manacher's algorithm\n\n    At the first glance it's not obvious that this algorithm has linear time complexity, because we often run the naive algorithm while searching the answer for a particular position.\n\n    However, a more careful analysis shows that the algorithm is linear. In fact, [Z-function building algorithm](/string/z-function.html), which looks similar to this algorithm, also works in linear time.\n\n    We can notice that every iteration of trivial algorithm increases $r$ by one. Also $r$ cannot be decreased during the algorithm. So, trivial algorithm will make $O(n)$ iterations in total.\n\n    Other parts of Manacher's algorithm work obviously in linear time. Thus, we get $O(n)$ time complexity.\n\n    ## Implementation of Manacher's algorithm\n\n    For calculating $d_{odd}[]$, we get the following code. Things to note:\n\n     - $i$ is the index of the center letter of the current palindrome.\n     - If $i$ exceeds $r$, $d_{odd}[i]$ is initialized to 0.\n     - If $i$ does not exceed $r$, $d_{odd}[i]$ is either initialized to the $d_{odd}[j]$, where $j$ is the mirror position of $i$ in $(l,r)$, or $d_{odd}[i]$ is restricted to the size of the \"outer\" palindrome.\n     - The while loop denotes the trivial algorithm. We launch it irrespective of the value of $k$.\n     - If the size of palindrome centered at $i$ is $x$, then $d_{odd}[i]$ stores $\\frac{x+1}{2}$.\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        s = \"$\" + s + \"^\";\n        vector<int> p(n + 2);\n        int l = 1, r = 1;\n        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            p[i] = max(0, min(r - i, p[l + (r - i)]));\n            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {\n                p[i]++;\n            }\n            if(i + p[i] > r) {\n                l = i - p[i], r = i + p[i];\n            }\n        }\n        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Working with parities\n\n    Although it is possible to implement Manacher's algorithm for odd and even lengths separately, the implementation of the version for even lengths is often deemed more difficult, as it is less natural and easily leads to off-by-one errors.\n\n    To mitigate this, it is possible to reduce the whole problem to the case when we only deal with the palindromes of odd length. To do this, we can put an additional `#` character between each letter in the string and also in the beginning and the end of the string:\n\n    $$abcbcba \\to \\#a\\#b\\#c\\#b\\#c\\#b\\#a\\#,$$\n\n    $$d = [1,2,1,2,1,4,1,8,1,4,1,2,1,2,1].$$\n\n    As you can see, $d[2i]=2 d_{even}[i]+1$ and $d[2i+1]=2 d_{odd}[i]$ where $d$ denotes the Manacher array for odd-length palindromes in `#`-joined string, while $d_{odd}$ and $d_{even}$ correspond to the arrays defined above in the initial string.\n\n    Indeed, `#` characters do not affect the odd-length palindromes, which are still centered in the initial string's characters, but now even-length palindromes of the initial string are odd-length palindromes of the new string centered in `#` characters.\n\n    Note that $d[2i]$ and $d[2i+1]$ are essentially the increased by $1$ lengths of the largest odd- and even-length palindromes centered in $i$ correspondingly.\n\n    The reduction is implemented in the following way:\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> manacher(string s) {\n        string t;\n        for(auto c: s) {\n            t += string(\"#\") + c;\n        }\n        auto res = manacher_odd(t + \"#\");\n        return vector<int>(begin(res) + 1, end(res) - 1);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    For simplicity, splitting the array into $d_{odd}$ and $d_{even}$ as well as their explicit calculation is omitted.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
