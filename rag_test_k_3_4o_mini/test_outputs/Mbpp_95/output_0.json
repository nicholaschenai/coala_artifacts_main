    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of lists (a two-dimensional list) and returns the length of the smallest list within that list of lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each list in the main list, check the length of each sublist, and keep track of the smallest length we encounter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the smallest length found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function Find_Min_Length(lists):\n       if lists is empty:\n           return 0\n       min_length = length of the first list\n       for each sublist in lists:\n           if length of sublist < min_length:\n               min_length = length of sublist\n       return min_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(lists):\n    # Check if the input list is empty\n    if not lists:\n        return 0  # Return 0 if there are no lists\n    # Initialize min_length with the length of the first sublist\n    min_length = len(lists[0])\n    # Iterate through each sublist in the main list\n    for sublist in lists:\n        # Update min_length if the current sublist is shorter\n        if len(sublist) < min_length:\n            min_length = len(sublist)\n    # Return the length of the smallest sublist found\n    return min_length\n```",
