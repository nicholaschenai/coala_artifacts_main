INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/95 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the smallest list contained within that list of lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each list in the main list, check the length of each sublist, and keep track of the smallest length we encounter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the smallest length found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `Find_Min_Length` that takes a parameter `lists`.
   - Initialize a variable `min_length` to a large number (like infinity).
   - Loop through each sublist in `lists`:
     - Get the length of the current sublist.
     - If this length is smaller than `min_length`, update `min_length`.
   - After the loop, return `min_length`.

    Title: Minimum stack / Minimum queue
    Part: 1/1
    # Minimum stack / Minimum queue

    In this article we will consider three problems: 
    first we will modify a stack in a way that allows us to find the smallest element of the stack in $O(1)$, then we will do the same thing with a queue, and finally we will use these data structures to find the minimum in all subarrays of a fixed length in an array in $O(n)$

    ## Stack modification

    We want to modify the stack data structure in such a way, that it possible to find the smallest element in the stack in $O(1)$ time, while maintaining the same asymptotic behavior for adding and removing elements from the stack.
    Quick reminder, on a stack we only add and remove elements on one end.

    To do this, we will not only store the elements in the stack, but we will store them in pairs: the element itself and the minimum in the stack starting from this element and below.

    ```cpp
    stack<pair<int, int>> st;
    ```

    It is clear that finding the minimum in the whole stack consists only of looking at the value `stack.top().second`.

    It is also obvious that adding or removing a new element to the stack can be done in constant time.

    Implementation:

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    int new_min = st.empty() ? new_elem : min(new_elem, st.top().second);
    st.push({new_elem, new_min});
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    int removed_element = st.top().first;
    st.pop();
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = st.top().second;
    ```

    ## Queue modification (method 1)

    Now we want to achieve the same operations with a queue, i.e. we want to add elements at the end and remove them from the front.

    Here we consider a simple method for modifying a queue.
    It has a big disadvantage though, because the modified queue will actually not store all elements.

    The key idea is to only store the items in the queue that are needed to determine the minimum.
    Namely we will keep the queue in nondecreasing order (i.e. the smallest value will be stored in the head), and of course not in any arbitrary way, the actual minimum has to be always contained in the queue.
    This way the smallest element will always be in the head of the queue.
    Before adding a new element to the queue, it is enough to make a "cut":
    we will remove all trailing elements of the queue that are larger than the new element, and afterwards add the new element to the queue. 
    This way we don't break the order of the queue, and we will also not loose the current element if it is at any subsequent step the minimum. 
    All the elements that we removed can never be a minimum itself, so this operation is allowed.
    When we want to extract an element from the head, it actually might not be there (because we removed it previously while adding a smaller element). 
    Therefore when deleting an element from a queue we need to know the value of the element.
    If the head of the queue has the same value, we can safely remove it, otherwise we do nothing.

    Consider the implementations of the above operations:

    ```cpp
    deque<int> q;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = q.front();
    ```

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    while (!q.empty() && q.back() > new_element)
        q.pop_back();
    q.push_back(new_element);
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (!q.empty() && q.front() == remove_element)
        q.pop_front();
    ```

    It is clear that on average all these operation only take $O(1)$ time (because every element can only be pushed and popped once).

    ## Queue modification (method 2)

    This is a modification of method 1.
    We want to be able to remove elements without knowing which element we have to remove.
    We can accomplish that by storing the index for each element in the queue.
    And we also remember how many elements we already have added and removed.

    ```cpp
    deque<pair<int, int>> q;
    int cnt_added = 0;
    int cnt_removed = 0;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = q.front().first;
    ```

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    while (!q.empty() && q.back().first > new_element)
        q.pop_back();
    q.push_back({new_element, cnt_added});
    cnt_added++;
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (!q.empty() && q.front().second == cnt_removed) 
        q.pop_front();
    cnt_removed++;
    ```

    ## Queue modification (method 3)

    Here we consider another way of modifying a queue to find the minimum in $O(1)$.
    This way is somewhat more complicated to implement, but this time we actually store all elements.
    And we also can remove an element from the front without knowing its value.

    The idea is to reduce the problem to the problem of stacks, which was already solved by us.
    So we only need to learn how to simulate a queue using two stacks.

    We make two stacks, `s1` and `s2`. 
    Of course these stack will be of the modified form, so that we can find the minimum in $O(1)$. 
    We will add new elements to the stack `s1`, and remove elements from the stack `s2`.
    If at any time the stack `s2` is empty, we move all elements from `s1` to `s2` (which essentially reverses the order of those elements).
    Finally finding the minimum in a queue involves just finding the minimum of both stacks.

    Thus we perform all operations in $O(1)$ on average (each element will be once added to stack `s1`, once transferred to `s2`, and once popped from `s2`)

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    stack<pair<int, int>> s1, s2;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    if (s1.empty() || s2.empty()) 
        minimum = s1.empty() ? s2.top().second : s1.top().second;
    else
        minimum = min(s1.top().second, s2.top().second);
    ```

    * Add element:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = s1.empty() ? new_element : min(new_element, s1.top().second);
    s1.push({new_element, minimum});
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (s2.empty()) {
        while (!s1.empty()) {
            int element = s1.top().first;
            s1.pop();
            int minimum = s2.empty() ? element : min(element, s2.top().second);
            s2.push({element, minimum});
        }
    }
    int remove_element = s2.top().first;
    s2.pop();
    ```

    ## Finding the minimum for all subarrays of fixed length

    Suppose we are given an array $A$ of length $N$ and a given $M \le N$.
    We have to find the minimum of each subarray of length $M$ in this array, i.e. we have to find:

    $$\min_{0 \le i \le M-1} A[i], \min_{1 \le i \le M} A[i], \min_{2 \le i \le M+1} A[i],~\dots~, \min_{N-M \le i \le N-1} A[i]$$

    We have to solve this problem in linear time, i.e. $O(n)$.

    We can use any of the three modified queues to solve the problem.
    The solutions should be clear:
    we add the first $M$ element of the array, find and output its minimum, then add the next element to the queue and remove the first element of the array, find and output its minimum, etc. 
    Since all operations with the queue are performed in constant time on average, the complexity of the whole algorithm will be $O(n)$.

    Title: Longest increasing subsequence
    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 1/2
    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum

    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).

    ## Problem statement

    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:

    $$ \max_{ 1 \le l \le r \le n } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.
    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.

    ## Algorithm 1

    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm is very simple.

    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.

    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.

    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.

    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.

    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.

    ### Implementation

    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ — we will only need the current element from it.

    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.

    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);
        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);
    }
    ```

    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        int cur = sum - min_sum;
        if (cur > ans) {
            ans = cur;
            ans_l = min_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = sum;
            min_pos = r;
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Algorithm 2

    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.

    **Proof:**

    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum — so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.

    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.

    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a "critical" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.

    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.

    ### Implementation

    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum);
        sum = max(sum, 0);
    }
    ```

    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        if (sum > ans) {
            ans = sum;
            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < 0) {
            sum = 0;
            minus_pos = r;
        }
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/95 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of lists (a two-dimensional list) and returns the length of the smallest list within that list of lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each list in the main list, check the length of each sublist, and keep track of the smallest length we encounter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the smallest length found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function Find_Min_Length(lists):
       if lists is empty:
           return 0
       min_length = length of the first list
       for each sublist in lists:
           if length of sublist < min_length:
               min_length = length of sublist
       return min_length
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def Find_Min_Length(lists):
    # Check if the input list is empty
    if not lists:
        return 0  # Return 0 if there are no lists
