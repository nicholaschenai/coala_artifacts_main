    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the number of sequences of a specified length `n`, where each element in the sequence is a positive integer. Each element must be at least twice the value of the previous element and must not exceed a given maximum value `m`.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**:\n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization. The idea is to define a function that counts the number of valid sequences starting from a given integer and builds the sequence by recursively finding valid next integers. The next integer must be at least double the current integer and must not exceed `m`. We will also use memoization to store results of previously computed states to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_sequences(current, n, m):\n       if n == 0:\n           return 1  // Base case: a valid sequence of length n is found\n       if current > m:\n           return 0  // If current exceeds m, no valid sequence can be formed\n       if (current, n) is in memo:\n           return memo[(current, n)]  // Return cached result\n\n       total_count = 0\n       next_value = 2 * current  // The next value must be at least double the current\n       while next_value <= m:\n           total_count += count_sequences(next_value, n - 1, m)  // Recur for the next value\n           next_value += 1  // Increment to check the next possible value\n\n       memo[(current, n)] = total_count  // Cache the result\n       return total_count\n\n   function get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n       memo = {}  // Initialize memoization dictionary\n       return count_sequences(1, n, m)  // Start counting from 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef count_sequences(current, n, m, memo):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1  # Base case: a valid sequence of length n is found\n    if current > m:\n        return 0  # If current exceeds m, no valid sequence can be formed\n    if (current, n) in memo:\n        return memo[(current, n)]  # Return cached result\n\n    total_count = 0\n    next_value = 2 * current  # The next value must be at least double the current\n    while next_value <= m:\n        total_count += count_sequences(next_value, n - 1, m, memo)  # Recur for the next value\n        next_value += 1  # Increment to check the next possible value\n\n    memo[(current, n)] = total_count  # Cache the result\n    return total_count\n\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    memo = {}  # Initialize memoization dictionary\n    return count_sequences(1, n, m, memo)  # Start counting from 1\n```",
