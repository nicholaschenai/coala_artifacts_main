    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis and the provided reference material, I will revise the solution to ensure it correctly counts the number of valid sequences according to the problem's requirements.\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Next Value Calculation**: Instead of incrementing `next_value` by 1, we will directly calculate the next valid value as `2 * current` and recursively call the function for that value until it exceeds `m`.\n2. **Memoization**: Ensure that the memoization is correctly implemented to store results for each state to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef count_sequences(current, n, m, memo):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1  # Base case: a valid sequence of length n is found\n    if current > m:\n        return 0  # If current exceeds m, no valid sequence can be formed\n    if (current, n) in memo:\n        return memo[(current, n)]  # Return cached result\n\n    total_count = 0\n    next_value = 2 * current  # The next value must be at least double the current\n    while next_value <= m:\n        total_count += count_sequences(next_value, n - 1, m, memo)  # Recur for the next value\n        next_value += 1  # Increment to check the next possible value\n\n    memo[(current, n)] = total_count  # Cache the result\n    return total_count\n\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    memo = {}  # Initialize memoization dictionary\n    return count_sequences(1, n, m, memo)  # Start counting from 1\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- The `count_sequences` function recursively counts the number of valid sequences starting from a given `current` value, with `n` elements remaining to be filled and a maximum value of `m`.\n- The base case checks if `n` is 0, indicating a valid sequence has been formed, and returns 1.\n- If the `current` value exceeds `m`, it returns 0 as no valid sequence can be formed.\n- The memoization dictionary `memo` is used to store results for previously computed states to optimize performance.\n- The loop generates the next valid values starting from `2 * current` and continues until it exceeds `m`, recursively counting valid sequences for each valid next value.\n- The `get_total_number_of_sequences` function initializes the memoization dictionary and starts the counting process from the first positive integer (1).\n\nThis revised solution should now correctly compute the number of valid sequences according to the problem's requirements.",
