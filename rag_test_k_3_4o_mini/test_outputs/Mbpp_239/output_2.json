    "raw_msg": "After reviewing the problem and the previous attempts, I realize that the logic for generating the sequences was not correctly implemented. The sequences must be generated in a way that respects the constraints of being at least double the previous element and not exceeding `m`. \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Sequence Generation**: The next value in the sequence must be at least `2 * current` and can be any integer up to `m`. This means we should not just increment `next_value` by 1 but rather jump to `2 * current` and then check all valid integers up to `m`.\n2. **Recursive Counting**: We need to ensure that we are counting all valid sequences starting from each valid integer.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. Start from the smallest valid integer (1).\n2. For each valid integer, recursively find the next valid integers that are at least double the current integer and less than or equal to `m`.\n3. Use memoization to store results for each state to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef count_sequences(current, n, m, memo):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1  # Base case: a valid sequence of length n is found\n    if current > m:\n        return 0  # If current exceeds m, no valid sequence can be formed\n    if (current, n) in memo:\n        return memo[(current, n)]  # Return cached result\n\n    total_count = 0\n    next_value = 2 * current  # The next value must be at least double the current\n    while next_value <= m:\n        total_count += count_sequences(next_value, n - 1, m, memo)  # Recur for the next value\n        next_value += 1  # Increment to check the next possible value\n\n    memo[(current, n)] = total_count  # Cache the result\n    return total_count\n\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m: int, n: int) -> int:\n    memo = {}  # Initialize memoization dictionary\n    return count_sequences(1, n, m, memo)  # Start counting from 1\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- The `count_sequences` function recursively counts the number of valid sequences starting from a given `current` value, with `n` elements remaining to be filled and a maximum value of `m`.\n- The base case checks if `n` is 0, indicating a valid sequence has been formed, and returns 1.\n- If the `current` value exceeds `m`, it returns 0 as no valid sequence can be formed.\n- The memoization dictionary `memo` is used to store results for previously computed states to optimize performance.\n- The loop generates the next valid values starting from `2 * current` and continues until it exceeds `m`, recursively counting valid sequences for each valid next value.\n- The `get_total_number_of_sequences` function initializes the memoization dictionary and starts the counting process from the first positive integer (1).\n\nThis revised solution should now correctly compute the number of valid sequences according to the problem's requirements.",
