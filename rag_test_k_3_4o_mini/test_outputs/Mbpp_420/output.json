    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a Python function that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4, and their cubes are 8 and 64, respectively. The sum of these cubes should be 72.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, we can follow these steps:\n   - Generate the first `n` even natural numbers. The `i-th` even number can be calculated as `2 * i`.\n   - For each of these even numbers, calculate its cube.\n   - Sum all the cubes together to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function cube_Sum(n):\n       initialize sum to 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           even_number = 2 * i\n           cube = even_number ** 3\n           sum += cube\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef cube_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Loop through the first n even natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th even natural number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Calculate the cube of the even number\n        cube = even_number ** 3\n        # Add the cube to the total sum\n        total_sum += cube\n    # Return the final sum of cubes\n    return total_sum\n```",
