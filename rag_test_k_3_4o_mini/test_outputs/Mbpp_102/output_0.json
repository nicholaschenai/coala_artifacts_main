    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that converts a string formatted in snake case (where words are separated by underscores) into camel case (where the first letter of each word is capitalized and there are no spaces or underscores).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will split the input string by underscores to separate the words.\n   - For each word, we will capitalize the first letter and make the rest of the letters lowercase.\n   - Finally, we will join all the capitalized words together to form the camel case string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function snake_to_camel(snake_str):\n       split the snake_str by underscores into a list of words\n       create an empty list to hold the capitalized words\n       for each word in the list:\n           capitalize the first letter of the word\n           add the capitalized word to the list\n       join the list of capitalized words into a single string\n       return the resulting string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef capitalize_first_letter(word):\n    # Capitalizes the first letter of the word and makes the rest lowercase\n    return word[0].upper() + word[1:].lower()\n\ndef snake_to_camel(snake_str: str) -> str:\n    # Split the input string by underscores\n    words = snake_str.split('_')\n    # Create a list to hold the capitalized words\n    capitalized_words = []\n    # Iterate over each word\n    for word in words:\n        # Capitalize the first letter of the word\n        capitalized_words.append(capitalize_first_letter(word))\n    # Join the capitalized words into a single string\n    return ''.join(capitalized_words)\n```",
