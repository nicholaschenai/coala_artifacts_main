INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/141 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function called `pancake_sort` that takes a list of integers and sorts them in ascending order. The function should return the sorted list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   The pancake sorting algorithm is a sorting technique that involves flipping segments of the list. The main idea is to repeatedly find the largest unsorted element, flip the list to bring it to the front, and then flip the entire unsorted segment to move it to its correct position. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function pancake_sort(arr):
       n = length of arr
       for i from n-1 down to 1:
           find the index of the maximum element in arr[0..i]
           if the maximum element is not at index i:
               flip the list to bring the maximum element to the front
               flip the list to move the maximum element to its correct position
       return arr
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def flip(arr, k):
    # This helper function reverses the order of the first k elements in arr
    start = 0
    while start < k:
        arr[start], arr[k] = arr[k], arr[start]
        start += 1
        k -= 1

def pancake_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Iterate from the end of the array to the beginning
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        # Find the index of the maximum element in arr[0..i]
        max_index = 0
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[max_index]:
                max_index = j
        
        # If the maximum element is not at index i, we need to flip
        if max_index != i:
            # Flip the maximum element to the front if it's not already there
            if max_index != 0:
                flip(arr, max_index)
            # Now flip the maximum element to its correct position
            flip(arr, i)
    
    return arr

    \index{sorting}

    \key{Sorting}
    is a fundamental algorithm design problem.
    Many efficient algorithms
    use sorting as a subroutine,
    because it is often easier to process
    data if the elements are in a sorted order.

    For example, the problem ''does an array contain
    two equal elements?'' is easy to solve using sorting.
    If the array contains two equal elements,
    they will be next to each other after sorting,
    so it is easy to find them.
    Also, the problem ''what is the most frequent element
    in an array?'' can be solved similarly.

    There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are
    also good examples of how to apply
    different algorithm design techniques.
    The efficient general sorting algorithms
    work in $O(n \log n)$ time,
    and many algorithms that use sorting
    as a subroutine also
    have this time complexity.

    \section{Sorting theory}

    The basic problem in sorting is as follows:
    \begin{framed}
    \noindent
    Given an array that contains $n$ elements,
    your task is to sort the elements
    in increasing order.
    \end{framed}
    \noindent
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    will be as follows after sorting:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{$O(n^2)$ algorithms}

    \index{bubble sort}

    Simple algorithms for sorting an array
    work in $O(n^2)$ time.
    Such algorithms are short and usually
    consist of two nested loops.
    A famous $O(n^2)$ time sorting algorithm
    is \key{bubble sort} where the elements
    ''bubble'' in the array according to their values.

    Bubble sort consists of $n$ rounds.
    On each round, the algorithm iterates through
    the elements of the array.
    Whenever two consecutive elements are found
    that are not in correct order,
    the algorithm swaps them.
    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) {
            if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
                swap(array[j],array[j+1]);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    After the first round of the algorithm,
    the largest element will be in the correct position,
    and in general, after $k$ rounds, the $k$ largest
    elements will be in the correct positions.
    Thus, after $n$ rounds, the whole array
    will be sorted.

    For example, in the array

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \noindent
    the first round of bubble sort swaps elements
    as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Inversions}

    \index{inversion}

    Bubble sort is an example of a sorting
    algorithm that always swaps \emph{consecutive}
    elements in the array.
    It turns out that the time complexity
    of such an algorithm is \emph{always}
    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,
    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.

    A useful concept when analyzing sorting
    algorithms is an \key{inversion}:
    a pair of array elements
    $(\texttt{array}[a],\texttt{array}[b])$ such that
    $a<b$ and $\texttt{array}[a]>\texttt{array}[b]$,
    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    has three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.
    The number of inversions indicates
    how much work is needed to sort the array.
    An array is completely sorted when
    there are no inversions.
    On the other hand, if the array elements
    are in the reverse order,
    the number of inversions is the largest possible:
    \[1+2+\cdots+(n-1)=\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\]

    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are
    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion
    from the array.
    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only
    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes
    at most one inversion, and the time complexity
    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{$O(n \log n)$ algorithms}

    \index{merge sort}

    It is possible to sort an array efficiently
    in $O(n \log n)$ time using algorithms
    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.
    One such algorithm is \key{merge sort}\footnote{According to \cite{knu983},
    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},
    which is based on recursion.

    Merge sort sorts a subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$ as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.
    \item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\lfloor (a+b)/2 \rfloor$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$.
    \item \emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and
    \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    into a sorted subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$.
    \end{enumerate}

    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it
    halves the size of the subarray at each step.
    The recursion consists of $O(\log n)$ levels,
    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.
    Merging the subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.

    For example, consider sorting the following array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};

    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};

    \section{Longest increasing subsequence}

    \index{longest increasing subsequence}

    Our first problem is to find the
    \key{longest increasing subsequence}
    in an array of $n$ elements.
    This is a maximum-length
    sequence of array elements
    that goes from left to right,
    and each element in the sequence is larger
    than the previous element.
    For example, in the array

    Let $\texttt{length}(k)$ denote
    the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position $k$.
    Thus, if we calculate all values of
    $\texttt{length}(k)$ where $0 \le k \le n-1$,
    we will find out the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence.
    For example, the values of the function
    for the above array are as follows:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{length}(0) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(4) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{length}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(6) & = & 4 \\
    \texttt{length}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{length}(6)=4$,
    because the longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position 6 consists of 4 elements.

    To calculate a value of $\texttt{length}(k)$,
    we should find a position $i<k$
    for which $\texttt{array}[i]<\texttt{array}[k]$
    and $\texttt{length}(i)$ is as large as possible.
    Then we know that
    $\texttt{length}(k)=\texttt{length}(i)+1$,
    because this is an optimal way to add
    $\texttt{array}[k]$ to a subsequence.
    However, if there is no such position $i$,
    then $\texttt{length}(k)=1$,
    which means that the subsequence only contains
    $\texttt{array}[k]$.

    Since all values of the function can be calculated
    from its smaller values,
    we can use dynamic programming.
    In the following code, the values
    of the function will be stored in an array
    $\texttt{length}$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        length[k] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (array[i] < array[k]) {
                length[k] = max(length[k],length[i]+1);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    This code works in $O(n^2)$ time,
    because it consists of two nested loops.
    However, it is also possible to implement
    the dynamic programming calculation
    more efficiently in $O(n \log n)$ time.
    Can you find a way to do this?

    Title: Topological Sorting
    Part: 1/1
    # Topological Sorting

    You are given a directed graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.
    You have to find an **order of the vertices**, so that every edge leads from the vertex with a smaller index to a vertex with a larger one.

    In other words, you want to find a permutation of the vertices (**topological order**) which corresponds to the order defined by all edges of the graph.

    Here is one given graph together with its topological order:

    <center>
    ![example directed graph](topological_1.png)
    ![one topological order](topological_2.png)
    </center>

    Topological order can be **non-unique** (for example, if there exist three vertices $a$, $b$, $c$ for which there exist paths from $a$ to $b$ and from $a$ to $c$ but not paths from $b$ to $c$ or from $c$ to $b$).
    The example graph also has multiple topological orders, a second topological order is the following:
    <center>
    ![second topological order](topological_3.png)
    </center>

    A Topological order may **not exist** at all.
    It only exists, if the directed graph contains no cycles.
    Otherwise because there is a contradiction: if there is a cycle containing the vertices $a$ and $b$, then $a$ needs to have a smaller index than $b$ (since you can reach $b$ from $a$) and also a bigger one (as you can reach $a$ from $b$).
    The algorithm described in this article also shows by construction, that every acyclic directed graph contains at least one topological order.

    A common problem in which topological sorting occurs is the following. There are $n$ variables with unknown values. For some variables we know that one of them is less than the other. You have to check whether these constraints are contradictory, and if not, output the variables in ascending order (if several answers are possible, output any of them). It is easy to notice that this is exactly the problem of finding topological order of a graph with $n$ vertices.

    ## The Algorithm

    To solve this problem we will use [depth-first search](depth-first-search.md).

    Let's assume that the graph is acyclic. What does the depth-first search do?

    When starting from some vertex $v$, DFS tries to traverse along all edges outgoing from $v$.
    It stops at the edges for which the ends have been already been visited previously, and traverses along the rest of the edges and continues recursively at their ends.

    Thus, by the time of the function call $\text{dfs}(v)$ has finished, all vertices that are reachable from $v$ have been either directly (via one edge) or indirectly visited by the search.

    Let's append the vertex $v$ to a list, when we finish $\text{dfs}(v)$. Since all reachable vertices have already been visited, they will already be in the list when we append $v$.
    Let's do this for every vertex in the graph, with one or multiple depth-first search runs.
    For every directed edge $v \rightarrow u$ in the graph, $u$ will appear earlier in this list than $v$, because $u$ is reachable from $v$.
    So if we just label the vertices in this list with $n-1, n-2, \dots, 1, 0$, we have found a topological order of the graph.
    In other words, the list represents the reversed topological order.

    These explanations can also be presented in terms of exit times of the DFS algorithm.
    The exit time for vertex $v$ is the time at which the function call $\text{dfs}(v)$ finished (the times can be numbered from $0$ to $n-1$).
    It is easy to understand that exit time of any vertex $v$ is always greater than the exit time of any vertex reachable from it (since they were visited either before the call $\text{dfs}(v)$ or during it). Thus, the desired topological ordering are the vertices in descending order of their exit times.

    ## Implementation

    Here is an implementation which assumes that the graph is acyclic, i.e. the desired topological ordering exists. If necessary, you can easily check that the graph is acyclic, as described in the article on [depth-first search](depth-first-search.md).

    ```cpp
    int n; // number of vertices
    vector<vector<int>> adj; // adjacency list of graph
    vector<bool> visited;
    vector<int> ans;

    void dfs(int v) {
        visited[v] = true;
        for (int u : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[u])
                dfs(u);
        }
        ans.push_back(v);
    }
 
    void topological_sort() {
        visited.assign(n, false);
        ans.clear();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (!visited[i])
                dfs(i);
        }
        reverse(ans.begin(), ans.end());
    }
    ```

    The main function of the solution is `topological_sort`, which initializes DFS variables, launches DFS and receives the answer in the vector `ans`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: The pancake sorting algorithm works by repeatedly flipping sections of the list to move the largest unsorted element to its correct position. The process involves finding the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list, flipping the list to bring that element to the front, and then flipping the entire unsorted portion to place the maximum element at the end of the sorted portion.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function pancake_sort(arr):
       n = length of arr
       for i from n-1 down to 1:
           find the index of the maximum element in arr[0..i]
           if the maximum element is not at index i:
               flip the array to bring the maximum to the front
