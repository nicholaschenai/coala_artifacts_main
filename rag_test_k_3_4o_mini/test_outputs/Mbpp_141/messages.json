\\emph{consecutive}\n    elements in the array.\n    It turns out that the time complexity\n    of such an algorithm is \\emph{always}\n    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,\n    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.\n\n    A useful concept when analyzing sorting\n    algorithms is an \\key{inversion}:\n    a pair of array elements\n    $(\\texttt{array}[a],\\texttt{array}[b])$ such that\n    $a<b$ and $\\texttt{array}[a]>\\texttt{array}[b]$,\n    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at

three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.\n    The number of inversions indicates\n    how much work is needed to sort the array.\n    An array is completely sorted when\n    there are no inversions.\n    On the other hand, if the array elements\n    are in the reverse order,\n    the number of inversions is the largest possible:\n    \\[1+2+\\cdots+(n-1)=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\\]\n\n    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are\n    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion\n    from the array.\n    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only\n    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes\n    at most one inversion, and the time complexity\n    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{$O(n \\log n)$ algorithms}\n\n    \\index{merge sort}\n\n    It is possible to sort an array efficiently\n    in $O(n \\log n)$ time using algorithms\n    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.\n    One such algorithm is \\key{merge sort}\\footnote{According to \\cite{knu983},\n    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},\n    which is based on recursion.\n\n    Merge sort sorts a subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$ as follows:\n\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.\n    \\item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\\lfloor (a+b)/2 \\rfloor$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$.\n    \\item \\emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and\n    \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    into a sorted subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it\n    halves the size of the subarray at each step.\n    The recursion consists of $O(\\log n)$ levels,\n    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.\n    Merging the subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.\n\n    For example, consider sorting the following array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at

There are $n$ variables with unknown values. For some variables we know that one of them is less than the other. You have to check whether these constraints are contradictory, and if not, output the variables in ascending order (if several answers are possible, output any of them). It is easy to notice that this is exactly the problem of finding topological order of a graph with $n$ vertices.\n\n    ## The Algorithm\n\n    To solve this problem we will use [depth-first search](depth-first-search.md).\n\n    Let's assume that the graph is acyclic. What does the depth-first search do?\n\n    When starting from some vertex $v$, DFS tries to traverse along all edges outgoing from $v$.\n    It stops at the edges for which the ends have been already been visited previously, and traverses along the rest of the edges and continues recursively at their ends.\n\n    Thus, by the time of the function call $\\text{dfs}(v)$ has finished, all vertices that are reachable from $v$ have been either directly (via one edge) or indirectly visited by the search.\n\n    Let's append the vertex $v$ to a list, when we finish $\\text{dfs}(v)$. Since all reachable vertices have already been visited, they will already be in the list when we append $v$.\n    Let's do this for every vertex in the graph, with one or multiple depth-first search runs.\n    For every directed edge $v \\rightarrow u$ in the graph, $u$ will appear earlier in this list than $v$, because $u$ is reachable from $v$.\n    So if we just label the vertices in this list with $n-1, n-2, \\dots, 1, 0$, we have found a topological order of the graph.\n    In other words, the list represents the reversed topological order.\n\n    These explanations can also be presented in terms of exit times of the DFS algorithm.\n    The exit time for vertex $v$ is the time at which the function call $\\text{dfs}(v)$ finished (the times can be numbered from $0$ to $n-1$).\n    It is easy to understand that exit time of any vertex $v$ is always greater than the exit time of any vertex reachable from it (since they were visited either before the call $\\text{dfs}(v)$ or during it). Thus, the desired topological ordering are the vertices in descending order of their exit times.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation which assumes that the graph is acyclic, i.e. the desired topological ordering exists. If necessary, you can easily check that the graph is acyclic, as described in the article on [depth-first search](depth-first-search.md).\n\n    ```cpp\n    int n; // number of vertices\n    vector<vector<int>> adj; // adjacency list of graph\n    vector<bool> visited;\n    vector<int> ans;\n\n    void dfs(int v) {\n        visited[v] = true;\n        for (int u : adj[v]) {\n            if (!visited[u])\n                dfs(u);\n        }\n        ans.push_back(v);\n    }\n \n    void topological_sort() {\n        visited.assign(n, false);\n        ans.clear();\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n            if (!visited[i])\n                dfs(i);\n        }\n        reverse(ans.begin(), ans.end());\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The main function of the solution is `topological_sort`, which initializes DFS variables, launches DFS and receives the answer in the vector `ans`.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
