INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/564 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and counts how many unique pairs of integers can be formed from that list, where the two integers in each pair are not the same.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - First, we need to identify all unique integers in the list.
   - Then, we can calculate the number of ways to choose two different integers from this set of unique integers. This can be done using the combination formula, which is `n choose 2` (nC2), where n is the number of unique integers. The formula for combinations is `nC2 = n * (n - 1) / 2`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_Pairs(int_list, n):
       create a set to store unique integers from int_list
       for each integer in int_list:
           add integer to the set
       count = size of the set
       if count < 2:
           return 0
       return count * (count - 1) / 2
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def count_Pairs(int_list, n):
    # Create a set to store unique integers from the list
    unique_integers = set()
    
    # Add each integer from the list to the set
    for num in int_list:
        unique_integers.add(num)
    
    # Count the number of unique integers
    count = len(unique_integers)
    
    # If there are less than 2 unique integers, return 0
    if count < 2:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the number of unordered pairs of unique integers
    return count * (count - 1) // 2

    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 3/5
    ```

    Asymptotics of the solution is $O (\sqrt{n})$.

    ### The number of integers in a given interval which are multiple of at least one of the given numbers

    Given $n$ numbers $a_i$ and number $r$. You want to count the number of integers in the interval $[1; r]$ that are multiple of at least one of the $a_i$.

    The solution algorithm is almost identical to the one for previous task — construct the formula of inclusion-exclusion on the numbers $a_i$, i.e. each term in this formula is the number of numbers divisible by a given subset of numbers $a_i$ (in other words, divisible by their [least common multiple](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md)).

    So we will now iterate over all $2^n$ subsets of integers $a_i$ with $O(n \log r)$ operations to find their least common multiple, adding or subtracting the number of multiples of it in the interval. Asymptotics is $O (2^n\cdot n\cdot \log r)$.

    ### The number of strings that satisfy a given pattern

    Consider $n$ patterns of strings of the same length, consisting only of letters ($a...z$) or question marks. You're also given a number $k$. A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. The task is to count the number of strings that match exactly $k$ of the patterns (first problem) and at least $k$ of the patterns (second problem).

    Notice first that we can easily count the number of strings that satisfy at once all of the specified patterns. To do this, simply "cross" patterns: iterate though the positions ("slots") and look at a position over all patterns. If all patterns have a question mark in this position, the character can be any letter from $a$ to $z$. Otherwise, the character of this position is uniquely defined by the patterns that do not contain a question mark.

    Learn now to solve the first version of the problem: when the string must satisfy exactly $k$ of the patterns.

    To solve it, iterate and fix a specific subset $X$ from the set of patterns consisting of $k$ patterns. Then we have to count the number of strings that satisfy this set of patterns, and only matches it, that is, they don't match any other pattern. We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a slightly different manner: we sum on all supersets $Y$ (subsets from the original set of strings that contain $X$), and either add to the current answer or subtract it from the number of strings:

    $$ ans(X) = \sum_{Y \supseteq X} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Where $f(Y)$ is the number of strings that match $Y$ (at least $Y$).

    (If you have a hard time figuring out this, you can try drawing Venn Diagrams.)

    If we sum up on all $ans(X)$, we will get the final answer:

    $$ ans = \sum_{X ~ : ~ |X| = k} ans(X) $$

    However, asymptotics of this solution is $O(3^k \cdot k)$. To improve it, notice that different $ans(X)$ computations very often share $Y$ sets.

    We will reverse the formula of inclusion-exclusion and sum in terms of $Y$ sets. Now it becomes clear that the same set $Y$ would be taken into account in the computation of $ans(X)$ of $\binom{|Y|}{k}$ sets with the same sign $(-1)^{|Y| - k}$.

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Now our solution has asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    We will now solve the second version of the problem: find the number of strings that match **at least** $k$ of the patterns.

    Of course, we can just use the solution to the first version of the problem and add the answers for sets with size greater than $k$. However, you may notice that in this problem, a set |Y| is considered in the formula for all sets with size $\ge k$ which are contained in $Y$. That said, we can write the part of the expression that is being multiplied by $f(Y)$ as:


    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-1} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+1} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-2} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+2} + \cdots + (-1)^{|Y|-|Y|} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{|Y|} $$

    Looking at Graham's (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. "Concrete mathematics" [1998] ), we see a well-known formula for [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \cdot \binom{n}{k} = (-1)^m \cdot \binom{n-1}{m} $$

    Applying it here, we find that the entire sum of binomial coefficients is minimized:

    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} $$

    Thus, for this task, we also obtained a solution with the asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$:

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    ### The number of ways of going from a cell to another

    There is a field $n \times m$, and $k$ of its cells are impassable walls. A robot is initially at the cell $(1,1)$ (bottom left). The robot can only move right or up, and eventually it needs to get into the cell $(n,m)$, avoiding all obstacles. You need to count the number of ways he can do it.

    Assume that the sizes $n$ and $m$ are very large (say, $10^9$), and the number $k$ is small (around $100$).

    For now, sort the obstacles by their coordinate $x$, and in case of equality — coordinate $y$.

    Also just learn how to solve a problem without obstacles: i.e. learn how to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another. In one axis, we need to go through $x$ cells, and on the other, $y$ cells. From simple combinatorics, we get a formula using [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$\binom{x+y}{x}$$

    Now to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another, avoiding all obstacles, you can use inclusion-exclusion to solve the inverse problem: count the number of ways to walk through the board stepping at a subset of obstacles (and subtract it from the total number of ways).

    When iterating over a subset of the obstacles that we'll step, to count the number of ways to do this simply multiply the number of all paths from starting cell to the first of the selected obstacles, a first obstacle to the second, and so on, and then add or subtract this number from the answer, in accordance with the standard formula of inclusion-exclusion.

    However, this will again be non-polynomial in complexity $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    Here goes a polynomial solution:

    We will use dynamic programming. For convenience, push (1,1) to the beginning and (n,m) at the end of the obstacles array. Let's compute the numbers $d[i]$ — the number of ways to get from the starting point ($0-th$) to $i-th$, without stepping on any other obstacle (except for $i$, of course). We will compute this number for all the obstacle cells, and also for the ending one.

    Let's forget for a second the obstacles and just count the number of paths from cell $0$ to $i$. We need to consider some "bad" paths, the ones that pass through the obstacles, and subtract them from the total number of ways of going from $0$ to $i$.

    When considering an obstacle $t$ between $0$ and $i$ ($0 < t < i$), on which we can step, we see that the number of paths from $0$ to $i$ that pass through $t$ which have $t$ as the **first obstacle between start and $i$**. We can compute that as: $d[t]$ multiplied by the number of arbitrary paths from $t$ to $i$. We can count the number of "bad" ways summing this for all $t$ between $0$ and $i$.

    We can compute $d[i]$ in $O(k)$ for $O(k)$ obstacles, so this solution has complexity $O(k^2)$.

    ### The number of coprime quadruples

    You're given $n$ numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You are required to count the number of ways to choose four numbers so that their combined greatest common divisor is equal to one.

    We will solve the inverse problem — compute the number of "bad" quadruples, i.e. quadruples in which all numbers are divisible by a number $d > 1$.

    We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle while summing over all possible groups of four numbers divisible by a divisor $d$.

    $$ans = \sum_{d \ge 2} (-1)^{deg(d)-1} \cdot f(d)$$

    Part: 1/2
    \chapter{Combinatorics}

    \index{combinatorics}

    \key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting
    combinations of objects.
    Usually, the goal is to find a way to
    count the combinations efficiently
    without generating each combination separately.

    As an example, consider the problem
    of counting the number of ways to
    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.
    For example, there are 8 representations
    for $4$:
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1+1+1+1$
    \item $1+1+2$
    \item $1+2+1$
    \item $2+1+1$
    \item $2+2$
    \item $3+1$
    \item $1+3$
    \item $4$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}

    A combinatorial problem can often be solved
    using a recursive function.
    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$
    that gives the number of representations for $n$.
    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.
    The values of the function
    can be recursively calculated as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        f(n) = \begin{cases}
                   1               & n = 0\\
                   f(0)+f(1)+\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case is $f(0)=1$,
    because the empty sum represents the number 0.
    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to
    choose the first number of the sum.
    If the first number is $k$,
    there are $f(n-k)$ representations
    for the remaining part of the sum.
    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values
    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.

    The first values for the function are:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    f(0) & = & 1 \\
    f(1) & = & 1 \\
    f(2) & = & 2 \\
    f(3) & = & 4 \\
    f(4) & = & 8 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced
    with a closed-form formula.
    In this problem,
    \[
    f(n)=2^{n-1},
    \]
    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$
    possible positions for +-signs in the sum
    and we can choose any subset of them.

    \section{Binomial coefficients}

    \index{binomial coefficient}

    The \key{binomial coefficient} ${n \choose k}$
    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset
    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.
    For example, ${5 \choose 3}=10$,
    because the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:
    \[ \{1,2,3\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,2,5\}, \{1,3,4\}, \{1,3,5\}, 
    \{1,4,5\}, \{2,3,4\}, \{2,3,5\}, \{2,4,5\}, \{3,4,5\} \]

    \subsubsection{Formula 1}

    Binomial coefficients can be
    recursively calculated as follows:

    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}
    \]

    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.
    If $x$ is included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k-1$
    elements from $n-1$ elements,
    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.

    The base cases for the recursion are
    \[
    {n \choose 0}  =  {n \choose n} = 1,
    \]
    because there is always exactly
    one way to construct an empty subset
    and a subset that contains all the elements.

    \subsubsection{Formula 2}

    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.
    \]

    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.
    We go through all permutations and always
    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation
    in the subset.
    Since the order of the elements in the subset
    and outside the subset does not matter,
    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$

    \subsubsection{Properties}

    For binomial coefficients,
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n \choose n-k},
    \]
    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into
    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements
    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.

    The sum of binomial coefficients is
    \[
    {n \choose 0}+{n \choose 1}+{n \choose 2}+\ldots+{n \choose n}=2^n.
    \]

    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''
    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to
    the $n$th power:

    \[ (a+b)^n =
    {n \choose 0} a^n b^0 + 
    {n \choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +
    \ldots + 
    {n \choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +
    {n \choose n} a^0 b^n. \]

    \subsubsection{Boxes and balls}

    ''Boxes and balls'' is a useful model,
    where we count the ways to
    place $k$ balls in $n$ boxes.
    Let us consider three scenarios:

    \textit{Scenario 1}: Each box can contain
    at most one ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 10 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --
                        (#1+0.5,#2-0.5) -- (#1+0.5,#2+0.5);
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{
        \lax{#1}{#2}{#3}
        \lax{#1+1.2}{#2}{#4}
        \lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}
        \lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}
        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}

    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{-4}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    In this scenario, the answer is directly the
    binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 2}: A box can contain multiple balls.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 15 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --

    }

    \laa{16}{-8}{0}{0}{0}{0}{2}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The process of placing the balls in the boxes
    can be represented as a string
    that consists of symbols
    ''o'' and ''$\rightarrow$''.
    Initially, assume that we are standing at the leftmost box.
    The symbol ''o'' means that we place a ball
    in the current box, and the symbol
    ''$\rightarrow$'' means that we move to
    the next box to the right.

    Using this notation, each solution is a string
    that contains $k$ times the symbol ''o'' and
    $n-1$ times the symbol ''$\rightarrow$''.
    For example, the upper-right solution
    in the above picture corresponds to the string
    ''$\rightarrow$ $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$''.
    Thus, the number of solutions is
    ${k+n-1 \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 3}: Each box may contain at most one ball,
    and in addition, no two adjacent boxes may both contain a ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/564 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to count the number of unordered pairs of unequal integers from a given list. For the input `[1, 2, 1]`, the unique integers are `1` and `2`, and the possible pairs are `(1, 2)`. Thus, the expected output is `1` because there is one unique pair of unequal integers.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: In my previous solution, I calculated the number of unique pairs using the formula for combinations, which is correct in terms of counting pairs from unique integers. However, I misunderstood the requirement of counting pairs based on the original list. The function should count how many times we can form pairs from the original list, not just from unique integers.

3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The mistake was in assuming that the number of unique integers directly translates to the number of pairs. Instead, I should have counted how many times each unique integer appears in the list and then calculated the pairs based on those counts.

### Revised Approach:
- Count the occurrences of each unique integer in the list.
- For each unique integer, calculate how many pairs can be formed with every other unique integer.
- Sum these counts to get the total number of unordered pairs of unequal integers.

Now, I will implement this revised logic in the code. 

```python
def count_Pairs(int_list, total):
    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each integer
    count_dict = {}
    
    # Count occurrences of each integer in the list
    for num in int_list:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    
    # Get the unique integers
    unique_numbers = list(count_dict.keys())
    
    # Initialize the count of pairs
    pair_count = 0
    
    # Calculate the number of pairs
    for i in range(len(unique_numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(unique_numbers)):
            pair_count += count_dict[unique_numbers[i]] * count_dict[unique_numbers[j]]
    
    return pair_count

    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 3/5
    ```

    Asymptotics of the solution is $O (\sqrt{n})$.

    ### The number of integers in a given interval which are multiple of at least one of the given numbers

    Given $n$ numbers $a_i$ and number $r$. You want to count the number of integers in the interval $[1; r]$ that are multiple of at least one of the $a_i$.

    The solution algorithm is almost identical to the one for previous task — construct the formula of inclusion-exclusion on the numbers $a_i$, i.e. each term in this formula is the number of numbers divisible by a given subset of numbers $a_i$ (in other words, divisible by their [least common multiple](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md)).

    So we will now iterate over all $2^n$ subsets of integers $a_i$ with $O(n \log r)$ operations to find their least common multiple, adding or subtracting the number of multiples of it in the interval. Asymptotics is $O (2^n\cdot n\cdot \log r)$.

    ### The number of strings that satisfy a given pattern

    Consider $n$ patterns of strings of the same length, consisting only of letters ($a...z$) or question marks. You're also given a number $k$. A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. The task is to count the number of strings that match exactly $k$ of the patterns (first problem) and at least $k$ of the patterns (second problem).

    Notice first that we can easily count the number of strings that satisfy at once all of the specified patterns. To do this, simply "cross" patterns: iterate though the positions ("slots") and look at a position over all patterns. If all patterns have a question mark in this position, the character can be any letter from $a$ to $z$. Otherwise, the character of this position is uniquely defined by the patterns that do not contain a question mark.

    Learn now to solve the first version of the problem: when the string must satisfy exactly $k$ of the patterns.

    To solve it, iterate and fix a specific subset $X$ from the set of patterns consisting of $k$ patterns. Then we have to count the number of strings that satisfy this set of patterns, and only matches it, that is, they don't match any other pattern. We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a slightly different manner: we sum on all supersets $Y$ (subsets from the original set of strings that contain $X$), and either add to the current answer or subtract it from the number of strings:

    $$ ans(X) = \sum_{Y \supseteq X} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Where $f(Y)$ is the number of strings that match $Y$ (at least $Y$).

    (If you have a hard time figuring out this, you can try drawing Venn Diagrams.)

    If we sum up on all $ans(X)$, we will get the final answer:

    $$ ans = \sum_{X ~ : ~ |X| = k} ans(X) $$

    However, asymptotics of this solution is $O(3^k \cdot k)$. To improve it, notice that different $ans(X)$ computations very often share $Y$ sets.

    We will reverse the formula of inclusion-exclusion and sum in terms of $Y$ sets. Now it becomes clear that the same set $Y$ would be taken into account in the computation of $ans(X)$ of $\binom{|Y|}{k}$ sets with the same sign $(-1)^{|Y| - k}$.

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Now our solution has asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    We will now solve the second version of the problem: find the number of strings that match **at least** $k$ of the patterns.

    Of course, we can just use the solution to the first version of the problem and add the answers for sets with size greater than $k$. However, you may notice that in this problem, a set |Y| is considered in the formula for all sets with size $\ge k$ which are contained in $Y$. That said, we can write the part of the expression that is being multiplied by $f(Y)$ as:


    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-1} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+1} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-2} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+2} + \cdots + (-1)^{|Y|-|Y|} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{|Y|} $$

    Looking at Graham's (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. "Concrete mathematics" [1998] ), we see a well-known formula for [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \cdot \binom{n}{k} = (-1)^m \cdot \binom{n-1}{m} $$

    Applying it here, we find that the entire sum of binomial coefficients is minimized:

    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} $$

    Thus, for this task, we also obtained a solution with the asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$:

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    ### The number of ways of going from a cell to another

    There is a field $n \times m$, and $k$ of its cells are impassable walls. A robot is initially at the cell $(1,1)$ (bottom left). The robot can only move right or up, and eventually it needs to get into the cell $(n,m)$, avoiding all obstacles. You need to count the number of ways he can do it.

    Assume that the sizes $n$ and $m$ are very large (say, $10^9$), and the number $k$ is small (around $100$).

    For now, sort the obstacles by their coordinate $x$, and in case of equality — coordinate $y$.

    Also just learn how to solve a problem without obstacles: i.e. learn how to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another. In one axis, we need to go through $x$ cells, and on the other, $y$ cells. From simple combinatorics, we get a formula using [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$\binom{x+y}{x}$$

    Now to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another, avoiding all obstacles, you can use inclusion-exclusion to solve the inverse problem: count the number of ways to walk through the board stepping at a subset of obstacles (and subtract it from the total number of ways).

    When iterating over a subset of the obstacles that we'll step, to count the number of ways to do this simply multiply the number of all paths from starting cell to the first of the selected obstacles, a first obstacle to the second, and so on, and then add or subtract this number from the answer, in accordance with the standard formula of inclusion-exclusion.

    However, this will again be non-polynomial in complexity $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    Here goes a polynomial solution:

    We will use dynamic programming. For convenience, push (1,1) to the beginning and (n,m) at the end of the obstacles array. Let's compute the numbers $d[i]$ — the number of ways to get from the starting point ($0-th$) to $i-th$, without stepping on any other obstacle (except for $i$, of course). We will compute this number for all the obstacle cells, and also for the ending one.

    Let's forget for a second the obstacles and just count the number of paths from cell $0$ to $i$. We need to consider some "bad" paths, the ones that pass through the obstacles, and subtract them from the total number of ways of going from $0$ to $i$.

    When considering an obstacle $t$ between $0$ and $i$ ($0 < t < i$), on which we can step, we see that the number of paths from $0$ to $i$ that pass through $t$ which have $t$ as the **first obstacle between start and $i$**. We can compute that as: $d[t]$ multiplied by the number of arbitrary paths from $t$ to $i$. We can count the number of "bad" ways summing this for all $t$ between $0$ and $i$.

    We can compute $d[i]$ in $O(k)$ for $O(k)$ obstacles, so this solution has complexity $O(k^2)$.

    ### The number of coprime quadruples

    You're given $n$ numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You are required to count the number of ways to choose four numbers so that their combined greatest common divisor is equal to one.

    We will solve the inverse problem — compute the number of "bad" quadruples, i.e. quadruples in which all numbers are divisible by a number $d > 1$.

    We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle while summing over all possible groups of four numbers divisible by a divisor $d$.

    $$ans = \sum_{d \ge 2} (-1)^{deg(d)-1} \cdot f(d)$$

    Chapter: Data structures
    Section: Comparison to sorting
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Comparison to sorting}

    It is often possible to solve a problem
    using either data structures or sorting.
    Sometimes there are remarkable differences
    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,
    which may be hidden in their time complexities.

    Let us consider a problem where
    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$
    that both contain $n$ elements.
    Our task is to calculate the number of elements
    that belong to both of the lists.
    For example, for the lists
    \[A = [5,2,8,9] \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\]
    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5
    and 9 belong to both of the lists.

    A straightforward solution to the problem is
    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,
    but next we will focus on
    more efficient algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,
    and after this, we iterate through the elements
    of $B$ and check for each elements if it
    also belongs to $A$.
    This is efficient because the elements of $A$
    are in a set.
    Using the \texttt{set} structure,
    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,
    so instead of the \texttt{set} structure
    we can also use the \texttt{unordered\_set} structure.
    This is an easy way to make the algorithm
    more efficient, because we only have to change
    the underlying data structure.
    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.
    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.
    After this, we iterate through both the lists
    at the same time and find the common elements.
    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n)$,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    so the total time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    The following table shows how efficient
    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and
    the elements of the lists are random
    integers between $1 \ldots 10^9$:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\
    $2 \cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\
    $3 \cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\
    $4 \cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\
    $5 \cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that
    they use different set structures.
    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on
    the running time, because Algorithm 2
    is 4–5 times faster than Algorithm 1.

    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3
    which uses sorting.
    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.
    Interestingly, the time complexity of both
    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \log n)$,
    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.
    This can be explained by the fact that
    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done
    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.
    On the other hand,
    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree
    during the whole algorithm.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/564 [generation text] Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will revise the solution to correctly count the number of unordered pairs of unequal integers from the original list.
