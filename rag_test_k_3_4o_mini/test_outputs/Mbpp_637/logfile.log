    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Coin problem
    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{Greedy algorithms}

    \index{greedy algorithm}

    A \key{greedy algorithm}
    constructs a solution to the problem
    by always making a choice that looks
    the best at the moment.
    A greedy algorithm never takes back
    its choices, but directly constructs
    the final solution.
    For this reason, greedy algorithms
    are usually very efficient.

    The difficulty in designing greedy algorithms
    is to find a greedy strategy
    that always produces an optimal solution
    to the problem.
    The locally optimal choices in a greedy
    algorithm should also be globally optimal.
    It is often difficult to argue that
    a greedy algorithm works.

    \section{Coin problem}

    As a first example, we consider a problem
    where we are given a set of coins
    and our task is to form a sum of money $n$
    using the coins.
    The values of the coins are
    $\texttt{coins}=\{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k\}$,
    and each coin can be used as many times we want.
    What is the minimum number of coins needed?

    For example, if the coins are the euro coins (in cents)
    \[\{1,2,5,10,20,50,100,200\}\]
    and $n=520$,
    we need at least four coins.
    The optimal solution is to select coins
    $200+200+100+20$ whose sum is 520.

    \subsubsection{Greedy algorithm}

    A simple greedy algorithm to the problem
    always selects the largest possible coin,
    until the required sum of money has been constructed.
    This algorithm works in the example case,
    because we first select two 200 cent coins,
    then one 100 cent coin and finally one 20 cent coin.
    But does this algorithm always work?

    It turns out that if the coins are the euro coins,
    the greedy algorithm \emph{always} works, i.e.,
    it always produces a solution with the fewest
    possible number of coins.
    The correctness of the algorithm can be
    shown as follows:

    First, each coin 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 appears
    at most once in an optimal solution,
    because if the
    solution would contain two such coins,
    we could replace them by one coin and
    obtain a better solution.
    For example, if the solution would contain
    coins $5+5$, we could replace them by coin $10$.

    In the same way, coins 2 and 20 appear
    at most twice in an optimal solution,
    because we could replace
    coins $2+2+2$ by coins $5+1$ and
    coins $20+20+20$ by coins $50+10$.
    Moreover, an optimal solution cannot contain
    coins $2+2+1$ or $20+20+10$,
    because we could replace them by coins $5$ and $50$.

    Using these observations,
    we can show for each coin $x$ that
    it is not possible to optimally construct
    a sum $x$ or any larger sum by only using coins
    that are smaller than $x$.
    For example, if $x=100$, the largest optimal
    sum using the smaller coins is  $50+20+20+5+2+2=99$.
    Thus, the greedy algorithm that always selects
    the largest coin produces the optimal solution.

    This example shows that it can be difficult
    to argue that a greedy algorithm works,
    even if the algorithm itself is simple.

    \subsubsection{General case}

    In the general case, the coin set can contain any coins
    and the greedy algorithm \emph{does not} necessarily produce
    an optimal solution.

    We can prove that a greedy algorithm does not work
    by showing a counterexample
    where the algorithm gives a wrong answer.
    In this problem we can easily find a counterexample:
    if the coins are $\{1,3,4\}$ and the target sum
    is 6, the greedy algorithm produces the solution
    $4+1+1$ while the optimal solution is $3+3$.

    It is not known if the general coin problem
    can be solved using any greedy algorithm\footnote{However, it is possible
    to \emph{check} in polynomial time
    if the greedy algorithm presented in this chapter works for
    a given set of coins \cite{pea05}.}.
    However, as we will see in Chapter 7,
    in some cases,
    the general problem can be efficiently
    solved using a dynamic
    programming algorithm that always gives the
    correct answer.

    Title: Sprague-Grundy theorem. Nim
    Part: 1/2
    # Sprague-Grundy theorem. Nim

    ## Introduction

    This theorem describes the so-called **impartial** two-player game,
    i.e. those in which the available moves and winning/losing depends only on the state of the game.
    In other words, the only difference between the two players is that one of them moves first.

    Additionally, we assume that the game has **perfect information**, i.e. no information is hidden from the players (they know the rules and the possible moves).

    It is assumed that the game is **finite**, i.e. after a certain number of moves, one of the players will end up in a losing position — from which they can't move to another position.
    On the other side, the player who set up this position for the opponent wins.
    Understandably, there are no draws in this game.

    Such games can be completely described by a *directed acyclic graph*: the vertices are game states and the edges are transitions (moves).
    A vertex without outgoing edges is a losing vertex (a player who must make a move from this vertex loses).

    Since there are no draws, we can classify all game states as either **winning** or **losing**.
    Winning states are those from which there is a move that causes inevitable defeat of the other player, even with their best response.
    Losing states are those from which all moves lead to winning states for the other player.
    Summarizing, a state is winning if there is at least one transition to a losing state and is losing if there isn't at least one transition to a losing state.

    Our task is to classify the states of a given game.

    The theory of such games was independently developed by Roland Sprague in 1935 and Patrick Michael Grundy in 1939.

    ## Nim

    This game obeys the restrictions described above.
    Moreover, *any* perfect-information impartial two-player game can be reduced to the game of Nim.
    Studying this game will allow us to solve all other similar games, but more on that later.

    Historically this game was popular in ancient times.
    Its origin is probably in China — or at least the game *Jianshizi* is very similar to it.
    In Europe the earliest references to it are from the 16th century.
    The name was given by Charles Bouton, who in 1901 published a full analysis of this game.

    ### Game description

    There are several piles, each with several stones.
    In a move a player can take any positive number of stones from any one pile and throw them away.
    A player loses if they can't make a move, which happens when all the piles are empty.

    The game state is unambiguously described by a multiset of positive integers.
    A move consists of strictly decreasing a chosen integer (if it becomes zero, it is removed from the set).

    ### The solution

    The solution by Charles L. Bouton looks like this:

    **Theorem.**
    The current player has a winning strategy if and only if the xor-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero.
    The xor-sum of a sequence $a$ is $a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus  a_n$, where $\oplus$ is the *bitwise exclusive or*.

    **Proof.**
    The key to the proof is the presence of a **symmetric strategy for the opponent**.
    We show that a once in a position with the xor-sum equal to zero, the player won't be able to make it non-zero in the long term —
    if they transition to a position with a non-zero xor-sum, the opponent will always have a move returning the xor-sum back to zero.

    We will prove the theorem by mathematical induction.

    For an empty Nim (where all the piles are empty i.e. the multiset is empty) the xor-sum is zero and the theorem is true.

    Now suppose we are in a non-empty state.
    Using the assumption of induction (and the acyclicity of the game) we assume that the theorem is proven for all states reachable from the current one.

    Then the proof splits into two parts:
    if for the current position the xor-sum $s = 0$, we have to prove that this state is losing, i.e. all reachable states have xor-sum $t \neq 0$.
    If $s \neq 0$, we have to prove that there is a move leading to a state with $t = 0$.

    *   Let $s = 0$ and let's consider any move.
        This move reduces the size of a pile $x$ to a size $y$.
        Using elementary properties of $\oplus$, we have
    
        \[ t = s \oplus x \oplus y = 0 \oplus x \oplus y = x \oplus y \]
    
        Since $y < x$, $y \oplus x$ can't be zero, so $t \neq 0$.
        That means any reachable state is a winning one (by the assumption of induction), so we are in a losing position.

    *   Let $s \neq 0$.
        Consider the binary representation of the number $s$.
        Let $d$ be the index of its leading (biggest value) non-zero bit.
        Our move will be on a pile whose size's bit number $d$ is set (it must exist, otherwise the bit wouldn't be set in $s$).
        We will reduce its size $x$ to $y = x \oplus s$.
        All bits at positions greater than $d$ in $x$ and $y$ match and bit $d$ is set in $x$ but not set in $y$.
        Therefore, $y < x$, which is all we need for a move to be legal.
        Now we have:
    
        \[ t = s \oplus x \oplus y = s \oplus x \oplus (s \oplus x) = 0 \]
    
        This means we found a reachable losing state (by the assumption of induction) and the current state is winning.

    **Corollary.**
    Any state of Nim can be replaced by an equivalent state as long as the xor-sum doesn't change.
    Moreover, when analyzing a Nim with several piles, we can replace it with a single pile of size $s$.

    ## The equivalence of impartial games and Nim (Sprague-Grundy theorem)

    Now we will learn how to find, for any game state of any impartial game, a corresponding state of Nim.

    ### Lemma about Nim with increases

    We consider the following modification to Nim: we also allow **adding stones to a chosen pile**.
    The exact rules about how and when increasing is allowed **do not interest us**, however the rules should keep our game **acyclic**. In later sections, example games are considered.

    **Lemma.**
    The addition of increasing to Nim doesn't change how winning and losing states are determined.
    In other words, increases are useless, and we don't have to use them in a winning strategy.

    **Proof.**
    Suppose a player added stones to a pile. Then his opponent can simply undo his move — decrease the number back to the previous value.
    Since the game is acyclic, sooner or later the current player won't be able to use an increase move and will have to do the usual Nim move.

    ### Sprague-Grundy theorem

    Let's consider a state $v$ of a two-player impartial game and let $v_i$ be the states reachable from it (where $i \in \{ 1, 2, \dots, k \} , k \ge 0$).
    To this state, we can assign a fully equivalent game of Nim with one pile of size $x$.
    The number $x$ is called the Grundy value or nim-value of state $v$.

    Moreover, this number can be found in the following recursive way:

    $$ x = \text{mex}\ \{ x_1, \ldots, x_k \}, $$

    where $x_i$ is the Grundy value for state $v_i$ and the function $\text{mex}$ (*minimum excludant*) is the smallest non-negative integer not found in the given set.

    Viewing the game as a graph, we can gradually calculate the Grundy values starting from vertices without outgoing edges.
    Grundy value being equal to zero means a state is losing.

    **Proof.**
    We will use a proof by induction.

    For vertices without a move, the value $x$ is the $\text{mex}$ of an empty set, which is zero.
    That is correct, since an empty Nim is losing.

    Now consider any other vertex $v$.
    By induction, we assume the values $x_i$ corresponding to its reachable vertices are already calculated.

    Let $p = \text{mex}\ \{ x_1, \ldots, x_k \}$.
    Then we know that for any integer $i \in [0, p)$ there exists a reachable vertex with Grundy value $i$.
    This means $v$ is **equivalent to a state of the game of Nim with increases with one pile of size $p$**.
    In such a game we have transitions to piles of every size smaller than $p$ and possibly transitions to piles with sizes greater than $p$.
    Therefore, $p$ is indeed the desired Grundy value for the currently considered state.

    ## Application of the theorem
[/Textbook Reference Material]


[Textbook Reference Material]:
    Chapter: Dynamic programming
    Section: Coin problem
    Part: 2/2
    $:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    value[0] = 0;
    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        value[x] = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            if (x-c >= 0) {
                value[x] = min(value[x], value[x-c]+1);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    In fact, most competitive programmers prefer this
    implementation, because it is shorter and has
    lower constant factors.
    From now on, we also use iterative implementations
    in our examples.
    Still, it is often easier to think about
    dynamic programming solutions
    in terms of recursive functions.


    \subsubsection{Constructing a solution}

    Sometimes we are asked both to find the value
    of an optimal solution and to give
    an example how such a solution can be constructed.
    In the coin problem, for example,
    we can declare another array
    that indicates for
    each sum of money the first coin 
    in an optimal solution:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int first[N];
    \end{lstlisting}
    Then, we can modify the algorithm as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    value[0] = 0;
    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        value[x] = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            if (x-c >= 0 && value[x-c]+1 < value[x]) {
                value[x] = value[x-c]+1;
                first[x] = c;
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this, the following code can be used to
    print the coins that appear in an optimal solution for
    the sum $n$:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    while (n > 0) {
        cout << first[n] << "\n";
        n -= first[n];
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Counting the number of solutions}

    Let us now consider another version
    of the coin problem where our task is to
    calculate the total number of ways
    to produce a sum $x$ using the coins.
    For example, if $\texttt{coins}=\{1,3,4\}$ and
    $x=5$, there are a total of 6 ways:

    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1+1+1+1+1$
    \item $1+1+3$
    \item $1+3+1$
    \item $3+1+1$
    \item $1+4$
    \item $4+1$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}

    Again, we can solve the problem recursively.
    Let $\texttt{solve}(x)$ denote the number of ways
    we can form the sum $x$.
    For example, if $\texttt{coins}=\{1,3,4\}$,
    then $\texttt{solve}(5)=6$ and the recursive formula is
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \texttt{solve}(x) = & \texttt{solve}(x-1) + \\
                        & \texttt{solve}(x-3) + \\
                        & \texttt{solve}(x-4)  .
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    Then, the general recursive function is as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{solve}(x) = \begin{cases}
                   0               & x < 0\\
                   1               & x = 0\\
                   \sum_{c \in \texttt{coins}} \texttt{solve}(x-c) & x > 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    If $x<0$, the value is 0, because there are no solutions.
    If $x=0$, the value is 1, because there is only one way
    to form an empty sum.
    Otherwise we calculate the sum of all values
    of the form $\texttt{solve}(x-c)$ where $c$ is in \texttt{coins}.

    The following code constructs an array
    $\texttt{count}$ such that
    $\texttt{count}[x]$ equals
    the value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    for $0 \le x \le n$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    count[0] = 1;
    for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        for (auto c : coins) {
            if (x-c >= 0) {
                count[x] += count[x-c];
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Often the number of solutions is so large
    that it is not required to calculate the exact number
    but it is enough to give the answer modulo $m$
    where, for example, $m=10^9+7$.
    This can be done by changing the code so that
    all calculations are done modulo $m$.
    In the above code, it suffices to add the line
    \begin{lstlisting}
            count[x] %= m;
    \end{lstlisting}
    after the line
    \begin{lstlisting}

    Now we have discussed all basic
    ideas of dynamic programming.
    Since dynamic programming can be used
    in many different situations,
    we will now go through a set of problems
    that show further examples about the
    possibilities of dynamic programming.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/637 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that checks if a given amount of money results in neither profit nor loss. This means that if the selling price is equal to the cost price, the function should return `True`, otherwise it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To determine if there is no profit and no loss, we need to compare two values: the cost price and the selling price. If both values are equal, it indicates that there is neither profit nor loss. Therefore, the function should return `True` in this case and `False` otherwise.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function noprofit_noloss(cost_price, selling_price):
       if cost_price is equal to selling_price:
           return True
       else:
           return False
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def noprofit_noloss(cost_price: int, selling_price: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the cost price is equal to the selling price
    if cost_price == selling_price:
        return True  # No profit, no loss
    else:
        return False  # There is profit or loss
```
