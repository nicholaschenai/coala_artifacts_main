combines two topics:\n    (1) the design of algorithms and (2) the implementation of algorithms.\n\n    The \\key{design of algorithms} consists of problem solving\n    and mathematical thinking.\n    Skills for analyzing problems and solving them\n    creatively are needed.\n    An algorithm for solving a problem\n    has to be both correct and efficient,\n    and the core of the problem is often\n    about inventing an efficient algorithm.\n\n    Theoretical knowledge of algorithms\n    is important to competitive programmers.\n    Typically, a solution to a problem is\n    a combination of well-known techniques and\n    new insights.\n    The techniques that appear in competitive programming\n    also form the basis for the scientific research\n    of algorithms.\n\n    The \\key{implementation of algorithms} requires good\n    programming skills.\n    In competitive programming, the solutions\n    are graded by testing an implemented algorithm\n    using a set of test cases.\n    Thus, it is not enough that the idea of the\n    algorithm is correct, but the implementation also\n    has to be correct.\n\n    A good coding style in contests is\n    straightforward and concise.\n    Programs should be written quickly,\n    because there is not much time available.\n    Unlike in traditional software engineering,\n    the programs are short (usually at most a few\n    hundred lines of code), and they do not need to \n    be maintained after the contest.\n\n    \\section{Programming languages}\n\n    \\index{programming language}\n\n    At the moment, the most popular programming\n    languages used in contests are C++, Python and Java.\n    For example, in Google Code Jam 2017,\n    among the best 3,000 participants,\n    79 \\% used C++,\n    16 \\% used Python and\n    8 \\% used Java \\cite{goo17}.\n    Some participants also used several languages.\n\n    Many people think that C++ is the best choice\n    for a competitive programmer,\n    and C++ is nearly always available in\n    contest systems.\n    The benefits of using C++ are that\n    it is a very efficient language and\n    its standard library contains a \n    large collection\n    of data structures and algorithms.\n\n    On the other hand, it is good to\n    master several languages and understand\n    their strengths.\n    For example, if large integers are needed\n    in the problem,\n    Python can be a good choice, because it\n    contains built-in operations for\n    calculating with large integers.\n    Still, most problems in programming contests\n    are set so that\n    using a specific programming language\n    is not an unfair advantage.\n\n    All example programs in this book are written in C++,\n    and the standard library's\n    data structures and algorithms are often used.\n    The programs follow the C++11 standard,\n    which can be used in most contests nowadays.\n    If you cannot program in C++ yet,\n    now is a good time to start learning.\n\n    \\subsubsection{C++ code template}\n\n    A typical C++ code template for competitive programming\n    looks like this:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\n    using namespace std;\n\n    int main() {\n        // solution comes here\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The \\texttt{\\#include} line at the beginning\n    of the code is a feature of the \\texttt{g++} compiler\n    that allows us to include the entire standard library.\n    Thus, it is not needed to separately include\n    libraries such as \\texttt{iostream},\n    \\texttt{vector} and \\texttt{algorithm},\n    but rather they are available automatically.\n\n    The \\texttt{using} line declares\n    that the classes and functions\n    of the standard library can be used directly\n    in the code.\n    Without the \\texttt{using} line we would have\n    to write, for example, \\texttt{std::cout},\n    but now it suffices to write \\texttt{cout}.\n\n    The code can be compiled using the following command:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -Wall test.cpp -o test\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    This command produces a binary file \\texttt{test}\n    from the source code \\texttt{test.cpp}.\n    The compiler follows the C++11 standard\n    (\\texttt{-std=c++11}),\n    optimizes the code (\\texttt{-O2})\n    and shows warnings about possible errors (\\texttt{-Wall}).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Introduction\n    Section: Shortening code\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Shortening code}\n\n    Short code is ideal in competitive programming,\n    because programs should be written\n    as fast as possible.\n    Because of this, competitive programmers often define\n    shorter names for datatypes and other parts of code.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Type names}\n    \\index{tuppdef@\\texttt{typedef}}\n    Using the command \\texttt{typedef}\n    it is possible to give a shorter name\n    to a datatype.\n    For example, the name \\texttt{long long} is long,\n    so we can define a shorter name \\texttt{ll}:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    typedef long long ll;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this, the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    long long a = 123456789;\n    long long b = 987654321;\n    cout << a*b << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    can be shortened as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    ll a = 123456789;\n    ll b = 987654321;\n    cout << a*b << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The command \\texttt{typedef}\n    can also be used with more complex types.\n    For example, the following code gives\n    the name \\texttt{vi} for a vector of integers\n    and the name \\texttt{pi} for a pair\n    that contains two integers.\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    typedef vector<int> vi;\n    typedef pair<int,int> pi;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Macros}\n    \\index{macro}\n    Another way to shorten code is to define\n    \\key{macros}.\n    A macro means that certain strings in\n    the code will be changed before the compilation.\n    In C++, macros are defined using the\n    \\texttt{\\#define} keyword.\n\n    For example, we can define the following macros:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #define F first\n    #define S second\n    #define PB push_back\n    #define MP make_pair\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this, the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    v.push_back(make_pair(y1,x1));\n    v.push_back(make_pair(y2,x2));\n    int d = v[i].first+v[i].second;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    can be shortened as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    v.PB(MP(y1,x1));\n    v.PB(MP(y2,x2));\n    int d = v[i].F+v[i].S;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    A macro can also have parameters\n    which makes it possible to shorten loops and other\n    structures.\n    For example, we can define the following macro:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #define REP(i,a,b) for (int i = a; i <= b; i++)\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this, the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        search(i);\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    can be shortened as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    REP(i,1,n) {\n        search(i);\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Sometimes macros cause bugs that may be difficult\n    to detect. For example, consider the following macro\n    that calculates the square of a number:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #define SQ(a) a*a\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    This macro \\emph{does not} always work as expected.\n    For example, the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << SQ(3+3) << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    corresponds to the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << 3+3*3+3 << \"\\n\"; // 15\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    A better version of the macro is as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    #define SQ(a) (a)*(a)\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    Now the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << SQ(3+3) << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    corresponds to the code\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    cout << (3+3)*(3+3) << \"\\n\"; // 36\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Prefix function. Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm\n    Part: 3/4\n    ```\n\n    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\\pi$, and then compute the final answers:\n    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.\n    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.\n\n    Now let us consider the second problem.\n    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:\n    we create the string $s + \\# + t$ and compute its prefix function.\n    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\\pi[i]$ for $i \\ge n + 1$.\n    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.\n\n    ### The number of different substring in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.\n\n    We will solve this problem iteratively.\n    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.\n\n    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.\n    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.\n    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.\n\n    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.\n    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.\n    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ long.\n    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.\n\n    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \\pi_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.\n\n    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.\n\n    ### Compressing a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to find the shortest \"compressed\" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.\n\n    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.\n    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \\pi[n - 1]$.\n    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.\n\n    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.\n    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.\n    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.\n    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.\n    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.\n    And so on.\n    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.\n\n    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.\n    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.\n    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.\n\n    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.\n    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.\n    We prove it by contradiction.\n    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).\n    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.\n    Now consider the second block of the string.\n    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.\n    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.\n    Contradiction.\n\n    $$\\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \\overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$\n\n    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\\pi[7] = 5}$$\n\n    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \\Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$\n\n    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function\n\n    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \\# + t$.\n    Obviously, since $\\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.\n    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \\#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:\n\n    $$\\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \\dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \\#}_{\\text{need to store}} ~ \\underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \\dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\\text{do not need to store}}$$\n\n    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \\in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.\n\n    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.\n\n    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\\text{old}_\\pi, c) \\rightarrow \\text{new}_\\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                int j = i;\n                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])\n                    j = pi[j-1];\n                if ('a' + c == s[j])\n                    j++;\n                aut[i][c] = j;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.\n    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.\n    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])\n                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];\n                else\n                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
