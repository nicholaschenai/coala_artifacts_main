The current rightmost match segment is assumed to be $[0; 0)$ (that is, a deliberately small segment which doesn't contain any $i$).\n\n    Inside the loop for $i = 1 \\dots n - 1$ we first determine the initial value $z[i]$ -- it will either remain zero or be computed using the above formula.\n\n    Thereafter, the trivial algorithm attempts to increase the value of $z[i]$ as much as possible.\n\n    In the end, if it's required (that is, if $i + z[i] > r$), we update the rightmost match segment $[l, r)$.\n\n    ## Asymptotic behavior of the algorithm\n\n    We will prove that the above algorithm has a running time that is linear in the length of the string -- thus, it's $O(n)$.\n\n    The proof is very simple.\n\n    We are interested in the nested `while` loop, since everything else is just a bunch of constant operations which sums up to $O(n)$.\n\n    We will show that **each iteration** of the `while` loop will increase the right border $r$ of the match segment.\n\n    To do that, we will consider both branches of the algorithm:\n\n    *   $i \\geq r$\n\n        In this case, either the `while` loop won't make any iteration (if $s[0] \\ne s[i]$), or it will take a few iterations, starting at position $i$, each time moving one character to the right. After that, the right border $r$ will necessarily be updated.\n\n        So we have found that, when $i \\geq r$, each iteration of the `while` loop increases the value of the new $r$ index.\n\n    *   $i < r$\n\n        In this case, we initialize $z[i]$ to a certain value $z_0$ given by the above formula. Let's compare this initial value $z_0$ to the value $r - i$. We will have three cases:\n\n          *   $z_0 < r - i$\n\n              We prove that in this case no iteration of the `while` loop will take place.\n\n              It's easy to prove, for example, by contradiction: if the `while` loop made at least one iteration, it would mean that initial approximation $z[i] = z_0$ was inaccurate (less than the match's actual length). But since $s[l \\dots r)$ and $s[0 \\dots r-l)$ are the same, this would imply that $z[i-l]$ holds the wrong value (less than it should be).\n\n              Thus, since $z[i-l]$ is correct and it is less than $r - i$, it follows that this value coincides with the required value $z[i]$.\n\n          *   $z_0 = r - i$\n\n              In this case, the `while` loop can make a few iterations, but each of them will lead to an increase in the value of the $r$ index because we will start comparing from $s[r]$, which will climb beyond the $[l, r)$ interval.\n\n          *   $z_0 > r - i$\n\n              This option is impossible, by definition of $z_0$.\n\n    So, we have proved that each iteration of the inner loop make the $r$ pointer advance to the right. Since $r$ can't be more than $n-1$, this means that the inner loop won't make more than $n-1$ iterations.\n\n    As the rest of the algorithm obviously works in $O(n)$, we have proved that the whole algorithm for computing Z-functions runs in linear time.\n\n    ## Applications\n\n    We will now consider some uses of Z-functions for specific tasks.\n\n    These applications will be largely similar to applications of [prefix function](prefix-function.md).\n\n    ### Search the substring\n\n    To avoid confusion, we call $t$ the **string of text**, and $p$ the **pattern**. The problem is: find all occurrences of the pattern $p$ inside the text $t$.\n\n    To solve this problem, we create a new string $s = p + \\diamond + t$, that is, we apply string concatenation to $p$ and $t$ but we also put a separator character $\\diamond$ in the middle (we'll choose $\\diamond$ so that it will certainly not be present anywhere in the strings $p$ or $t$).\n\n    Compute the Z-function for $s$. Then, for any $i$ in the interval $[0; \\; \\operatorname{length}(t) - 1]$, we will consider the corresponding value $k = z[i + \\operatorname{length}(p) + 1]$. If $k$ is equal to $\\operatorname{length}(p)$ then we know there is one occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$, otherwise there is no occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$.\n\n    The running time (and memory consumption) is $O(\\operatorname{length}(t) + \\operatorname{length}(p))$.\n\n    ### Number of distinct substrings in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$, count the number of distinct substrings of $s$.\n\n    We'll solve this problem iteratively. That is: knowing the current number of different substrings, recalculate this amount after adding to the end of $s$ one character.\n\n    So, let $k$ be the current number of distinct substrings of $s$. We append a new character $c$ to $s$. Obviously, there can be some new substrings ending in this new character $c$ (namely, all those strings that end with this symbol and that we haven't encountered yet).\n\n    Take a string $t = s + c$ and invert it (write its characters in reverse order). Our task is now to count how many prefixes of $t$ are not found anywhere else in $t$. Let's compute the Z-function of $t$ and find its maximum value $z_{max}$. Obviously, $t$'s prefix of length $z_{max}$ occurs also somewhere in the middle of $t$. Clearly, shorter prefixes also occur.\n\n    So, we have found that the number of new substrings that appear when symbol $c$ is appended to $s$ is equal to $\\operatorname{length}(t) - z_{max}$.\n\n    Consequently, the running time of this solution is $O(n^2)$ for a string of length $n$.\n\n    It's worth noting that in exactly the same way we can recalculate, still in $O(n)$ time, the number of distinct substrings when appending a character in the beginning of the string, as well as when removing it (from the end or the beginning).\n\n    ### String compression\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$. Find its shortest \"compressed\" representation, that is: find a string $t$ of shortest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    A solution is: compute the Z-function of $s$, loop through all $i$ such that $i$ divides $n$. Stop at the first $i$ such that $i + z[i] = n$. Then, the string $s$ can be compressed to the length $i$.\n\n    The proof for this fact is the same as the solution which uses the [prefix function](prefix-function.md).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: String algorithms\n    Section: Z-algorithm\n    Part: 1/3\n    \\section{Z-algorithm}\n\n    \\index{Z-algorithm}\n    \\index{Z-array}\n\n    The \\key{Z-array} \\texttt{z} of a string \\texttt{s}\n    of length $n$ contains for each $k=0,1,\\ldots,n-1$\n    the length of the longest substring of \\texttt{s}\n    that begins at position $k$ and is a prefix of \\texttt{s}.\n    Thus, $\\texttt{z}[k]=p$ tells us that\n    $\\texttt{s}[0 \\ldots p-1]$ equals $\\texttt{s}[k \\ldots k+p-1]$.\n    Many string processing problems can be efficiently solved\n    using the Z-array.\n\n    For example, the Z-array of\n    \\texttt{ACBACDACBACBACDA} is as follows:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw

this case, for example, $\\texttt{z}[6]=5$,\n    because the substring \\texttt{ACBAC} of length 5\n    is a prefix of \\texttt{s},\n    but the substring \\texttt{ACBACB} of length 6\n    is not a prefix of \\texttt{s}.\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Algorithm description}\n\n    Next we describe an algorithm,\n    called the \\key{Z-algorithm}\\footnote{The Z-algorithm\n    was presented in \\cite{gus97} as the simplest known\n    method for linear-time pattern matching, and the original idea\n    was attributed to \\cite{mai84}.},\n    that efficiently constructs the Z-array in $O(n)$ time.\n    The algorithm calculates the Z-array values\n    from left to right by both using information\n    already stored in the Z-array and comparing substrings\n    character by character.\n\n    To efficiently calculate the Z-array values,\n    the algorithm maintains a range $[x,y]$ such that\n    $\\texttt{s}[x \\ldots y]$ is a prefix of \\texttt{s}\n    and $y$ is as large as possible.\n    Since we know that $\\texttt{s}[0 \\ldots y-x]$\n    and $\\texttt{s}[x \\ldots y]$ are equal,\n    we can use this information when calculating\n    Z-values for positions $x+1,x+2,\\ldots,y$.\n\n    At each position $k$, we first\n    check the value of $\\texttt{z}[k-x]$.\n    If $k+\\texttt{z}[k-x]<y$, we know that $\\texttt{z}[k]=\\texttt{z}[k-x]$.\n    However, if $k+\\texttt{z}[k-x] \\ge y$,\n    $\\texttt{s}[0 \\ldots y-k]$ equals\n    $\\texttt{s}[k \\ldots y]$, and to determine the\n    value of $\\texttt{z}[k]$ we need to compare\n    the substrings character by character.\n    Still, the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,\n    because we start comparing at positions\n    $y-k+1$ and $y+1$.\n\n    For example, let us construct the following Z-array:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n
