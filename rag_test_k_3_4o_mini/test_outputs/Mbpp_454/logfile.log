## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/454 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z'. If the string contains 'z', the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a simple approach where we check if the character 'z' is present in the input string. We can use the `in` keyword in Python, which allows us to check for the existence of a substring within a string. If 'z' is found, we return `True`; if not, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION text_match_wordz(word):
       IF 'z' is in word:
           RETURN True
       ELSE:
           RETURN False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define the function that checks for the presence of 'z' in the input string
def text_match_wordz(word: str) -> bool:
    # Check if 'z' is in the provided word
    if 'z' in word:
        return True  # Return True if 'z' is found
    else:
        return False  # Return False if 'z' is not found
```

    \subsubsection{Using the Z-array}

    It is often a matter of taste whether to use
    string hashing or the Z-algorithm.
    Unlike hashing, the Z-algorithm always works
    and there is no risk for collisions.
    On the other hand, the Z-algorithm is more difficult
    to implement and some problems can only be solved
    using hashing.

    As an example, consider again
    the pattern matching problem,
    where our task is to find the occurrences
    of a pattern $p$ in a string $s

    Title: Z-function and its calculation
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    ### Comments on this implementation

    The whole solution is given as a function which returns an array of length $n$ -- the Z-function of $s$.

    Array $z$ is initially filled with zeros. The current rightmost match segment is assumed to be $[0; 0)$ (that is, a deliberately small segment which doesn't contain any $i$).

    Inside the loop for $i = 1 \dots n - 1$ we first determine the initial value $z[i]$ -- it will either remain zero or be computed using the above formula.

    Thereafter, the trivial algorithm attempts to increase the value of $z[i]$ as much as possible.

    In the end, if it's required (that is, if $i + z[i] > r$), we update the rightmost match segment $[l, r)$.

    ## Asymptotic behavior of the algorithm

    We will prove that the above algorithm has a running time that is linear in the length of the string -- thus, it's $O(n)$.

    The proof is very simple.

    We are interested in the nested `while` loop, since everything else is just a bunch of constant operations which sums up to $O(n)$.

    We will show that **each iteration** of the `while` loop will increase the right border $r$ of the match segment.

    To do that, we will consider both branches of the algorithm:

    *   $i \geq r$

        In this case, either the `while` loop won't make any iteration (if $s[0] \ne s[i]$), or it will take a few iterations, starting at position $i$, each time moving one character to the right. After that, the right border $r$ will necessarily be updated.

        So we have found that, when $i \geq r$, each iteration of the `while` loop increases the value of the new $r$ index.

    *   $i < r$

        In this case, we initialize $z[i]$ to a certain value $z_0$ given by the above formula. Let's compare this initial value $z_0$ to the value $r - i$. We will have three cases:

          *   $z_0 < r - i$

              We prove that in this case no iteration of the `while` loop will take place.

              It's easy to prove, for example, by contradiction: if the `while` loop made at least one iteration, it would mean that initial approximation $z[i] = z_0$ was inaccurate (less than the match's actual length). But since $s[l \dots r)$ and $s[0 \dots r-l)$ are the same, this would imply that $z[i-l]$ holds the wrong value (less than it should be).

              Thus, since $z[i-l]$ is correct and it is less than $r - i$, it follows that this value coincides with the required value $z[i]$.

          *   $z_0 = r - i$

              In this case, the `while` loop can make a few iterations, but each of them will lead to an increase in the value of the $r$ index because we will start comparing from $s[r]$, which will climb beyond the $[l, r)$ interval.

          *   $z_0 > r - i$

              This option is impossible, by definition of $z_0$.

    So, we have proved that each iteration of the inner loop make the $r$ pointer advance to the right. Since $r$ can't be more than $n-1$, this means that the inner loop won't make more than $n-1$ iterations.

    As the rest of the algorithm obviously works in $O(n)$, we have proved that the whole algorithm for computing Z-functions runs in linear time.

    ## Applications

    We will now consider some uses of Z-functions for specific tasks.

    These applications will be largely similar to applications of [prefix function](prefix-function.md).

    ### Search the substring

    To avoid confusion, we call $t$ the **string of text**, and $p$ the **pattern**. The problem is: find all occurrences of the pattern $p$ inside the text $t$.

    To solve this problem, we create a new string $s = p + \diamond + t$, that is, we apply string concatenation to $p$ and $t$ but we also put a separator character $\diamond$ in the middle (we'll choose $\diamond$ so that it will certainly not be present anywhere in the strings $p$ or $t$).

    Compute the Z-function for $s$. Then, for any $i$ in the interval $[0; \; \operatorname{length}(t) - 1]$, we will consider the corresponding value $k = z[i + \operatorname{length}(p) + 1]$. If $k$ is equal to $\operatorname{length}(p)$ then we know there is one occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$, otherwise there is no occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$.

    The running time (and memory consumption) is $O(\operatorname{length}(t) + \operatorname{length}(p))$.

    ### Number of distinct substrings in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$, count the number of distinct substrings of $s$.

    We'll solve this problem iteratively. That is: knowing the current number of different substrings, recalculate this amount after adding to the end of $s$ one character.

    So, let $k$ be the current number of distinct substrings of $s$. We append a new character $c$ to $s$. Obviously, there can be some new substrings ending in this new character $c$ (namely, all those strings that end with this symbol and that we haven't encountered yet).

    Take a string $t = s + c$ and invert it (write its characters in reverse order). Our task is now to count how many prefixes of $t$ are not found anywhere else in $t$. Let's compute the Z-function of $t$ and find its maximum value $z_{max}$. Obviously, $t$'s prefix of length $z_{max}$ occurs also somewhere in the middle of $t$. Clearly, shorter prefixes also occur.

    So, we have found that the number of new substrings that appear when symbol $c$ is appended to $s$ is equal to $\operatorname{length}(t) - z_{max}$.

    Consequently, the running time of this solution is $O(n^2)$ for a string of length $n$.

    It's worth noting that in exactly the same way we can recalculate, still in $O(n)$ time, the number of distinct substrings when appending a character in the beginning of the string, as well as when removing it (from the end or the beginning).

    ### String compression

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$. Find its shortest "compressed" representation, that is: find a string $t$ of shortest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    A solution is: compute the Z-function of $s$, loop through all $i$ such that $i$ divides $n$. Stop at the first $i$ such that $i + z[i] = n$. Then, the string $s$ can be compressed to the length $i$.

    The proof for this fact is the same as the solution which uses the [prefix function](prefix-function.md).

    \index{Z-algorithm}
    \index{Z-array}

    The \key{Z-array} \texttt{z} of a string \texttt{s}
    of length $n$ contains for each $k=0,1,\ldots,n-1$
    the length of the longest substring of \texttt{s}
    that begins at position $k$ and is a prefix of \texttt{s}.
    Thus, $\texttt{z}[k]=p$ tells us that
    $\texttt{s}[0 \ldots p-1]$ equals $\texttt{s}[k \ldots k+p-1]$.
    Many string processing problems can be efficiently solved
    using the Z-array.

    For example, the Z-array of
    \texttt{ACBACDACBACBACDA} is as follows:

    In this case, for example, $\texttt{z}[6]=5$,
    because the substring \texttt{ACBAC} of length 5
    is a prefix of \texttt{s},
    but the substring \texttt{ACBACB} of length 6
    is not a prefix of \texttt{s}.

    \subsubsection*{Algorithm description}

    Next we describe an algorithm,
    called the \key{Z-algorithm}\footnote{The Z-algorithm
    was presented in \cite{gus97} as the simplest known
    method for linear-time pattern matching, and the original idea
    was attributed to \cite{mai84}.},
    that efficiently constructs the Z-array in $O(n)$ time.
    The algorithm calculates the Z-array values
    from left to right by both using information
    already stored in the Z-array and comparing substrings
    character by character.

    To efficiently calculate the Z-array values,
    the algorithm maintains a range $[x,y]$ such that
    $\texttt{s}[x \ldots y]$ is a prefix of \texttt{s}
    and $y$ is as large as possible.
    Since we know that $\texttt{s}[0 \ldots y-x]$
    and $\texttt{s}[x \ldots y]$ are equal,
    we can use this information when calculating
    Z-values for positions $x+1,x+2,\ldots,y$.

    At each position $k$, we first
    check the value of $\texttt{z}[k-x]$.
    If $k+\texttt{z}[k-x]<y$, we know that $\texttt{z}[k]=\texttt{z}[k-x]$.
    However, if $k+\texttt{z}[k-x] \ge y$,
    $\texttt{s}[0 \ldots y-k]$ equals
    $\texttt{s}[k \ldots y]$, and to determine the
    value of $\texttt{z}[k]$ we need to compare
    the substrings character by character.
    Still, the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    because we start comparing at positions
    $y-k+1$ and $y+1$.

    For example, let us construct the following Z-array:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
