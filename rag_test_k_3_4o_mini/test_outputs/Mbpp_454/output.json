    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z'. If the string has at least one 'z', the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The solution involves iterating through each character in the input string and checking if any of those characters is 'z'. If we find 'z', we return `True`. If we finish checking all characters without finding 'z', we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function text_match_wordz(word):\n       for each character in word:\n           if character is 'z':\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef text_match_wordz(word: str) -> bool:\n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in word:\n        # Check if the current character is 'z'\n        if char == 'z':\n            return True  # Return True if 'z' is found\n    return False  # Return False if 'z' is not found\n```",
