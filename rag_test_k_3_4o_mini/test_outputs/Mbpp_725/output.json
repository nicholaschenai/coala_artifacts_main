    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that extracts all the substrings found between double quotation marks (`\" \"`) in a given string. The output should be a list of these extracted substrings.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   - We will iterate through the input string character by character.\n   - We will keep track of whether we are currently inside a pair of quotation marks.\n   - When we encounter a quotation mark, we will toggle our state (inside or outside).\n   - If we are inside, we will start collecting characters until we hit another quotation mark, at which point we will save the collected substring.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of collected substrings.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function extract_quotation(input_string):\n       initialize an empty list to hold results\n       initialize an empty string to collect characters\n       initialize a boolean variable to track if we are inside quotes (set to False)\n       \n       for each character in input_string:\n           if character is a quotation mark:\n               if we are inside quotes:\n                   add the collected string to results\n                   reset the collected string\n                   toggle the inside quotes variable to False\n               else:\n                   toggle the inside quotes variable to True\n           else if we are inside quotes:\n               append the character to the collected string\n       \n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef extract_quotation(input_string: str) -> list:\n    results = []  # List to hold the extracted substrings\n    current_string = \"\"  # String to collect characters between quotes\n    inside_quotes = False  # Boolean to track if we are inside quotes\n\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char == '\"':  # Check for quotation mark\n            if inside_quotes:  # If we are already inside quotes\n                results.append(current_string)  # Save the collected string\n                current_string = \"\"  # Reset for the next potential string\n                inside_quotes = False  # Toggle the state\n            else:\n                inside_quotes = True  # We are now inside quotes\n        elif inside_quotes:  # If we are inside quotes, collect characters\n            current_string += char\n\n    return results  # Return the list of extracted substrings\n```",
