    \index{knapsack}

    The term \key{knapsack} refers to problems where
    a set of objects is given, and 
    subsets with some properties
    have to be found.
    Knapsack problems can often be solved
    using dynamic programming.

    In this section, we focus on the following
    problem: Given a list of weights
    $[w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n]$,
    determine all
    sums that can be constructed using the weights.
    For example, if the weights are
    $[1,3,3,5]$, the following sums are possible:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
     0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    In this case, all sums between $0 \ldots 12$
    are possible, except 2 and 10.
    For example, the sum 7 is possible because we
    can select the weights $[1,3,3]$.

    To solve the problem, we focus on subproblems
    where we only use the first $k$ weights
    to construct sums.
    Let $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{true}$ if
    we can construct a sum $x$
    using the first $k$ weights,
    and otherwise $\texttt{possible}(x,k)=\textrm{false}$.
    The values of the function can be recursively
    calculated as follows:
    \[ \texttt{possible}(x,k) = \texttt{possible}(x-w_k,k-1) \lor \texttt{possible}(x,k-1) \]
    The formula is based on the fact that we can
    either use or not use the weight $w_k$ in the sum.
    If we use $w_k$, the remaining task is to
    form the sum $x-w_k$ using the first $k-1$ weights,
    and if we do not use $w_k$,
    the remaining task is to form the sum $x$
    using the first $k-1$ weights.
    As the base cases,
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{possible}(x,0) = \begin{cases}
                   \textrm{true}    & x = 0\\
                   \textrm{false}   & x \neq 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    because if no weights are used,
    we can only form the sum 0.

    The following table shows all values of the function
    for the weights $[1,3,3,5]$ (the symbol ''X''
    indicates the true values):

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrrrrrrr}
    $k \backslash x$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
     0 & X & \\
     1 & X & X \\
     2 & X & X & & X & X \\
     3 & X & X & & X & X & & X & X \\
     4 & X & X & & X & X & X & X & X & X & X & & X & X \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    After calculating those values, $\texttt{possible}(x,n)$
    tells us whether we can construct a
    sum $x$ using \emph{all} weights.

    Let $W$ denote the total sum of the weights.
    The following $O(nW)$ time
    dynamic programming solution
    corresponds to the recursive function:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0][0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = 0; x <= W; x++) {
            if (x-w[k] >= 0) possible[x][k] |= possible[x-w[k]][k-1];
            possible[x][k] |= possible[x][k-1];
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    However, here is a better implementation that only uses
    a one-dimensional array $\texttt{possible}[x]$
    that indicates whether we can construct a subset with sum $x$.
    The trick is to update the array from right to left for
    each new weight:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    possible[0] = true;
    for (int k = 1; k <= n; k++) {
        for (int x = W; x >= 0; x--) {
            if (possible[x]) possible[x+w[k]] = true;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that the general idea presented here can be used
    in many knapsack problems.
    For example, if we are given objects with weights and values,
    we can determine for each weight sum the maximum value
    sum of a subset.

    Title: Longest increasing subsequence
    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

    Title: Longest increasing subsequence
    Part: 3/3
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    It is also possible to restore the subsequence using this approach.
    This time we have to maintain two auxiliary arrays.
    One that tells us the index of the elements in $d[]$.
    And again we have to create an array of "ancestors" $p[i]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index of the previous element for the optimal subsequence ending in element $i$.

    It's easy to maintain these two arrays in the course of iteration over the array $a[]$ alongside the computations of $d[]$.
    And at the end it is not difficult to restore the desired subsequence using these arrays.

    ## Solution in $O(n \log n)$ with data structures {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n log n) with data structures"}

    Instead of the above method for computing the longest increasing subsequence in $O(n \log n)$ we can also solve the problem in a different way: using some simple data structures.

    Let's go back to the first method.
    Remember that $d[i]$ is the value $d[j] + 1$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

    Thus if we define an additional array $t[]$ such that

    $$t[a[i]] = d[i],$$

    then the problem of computing the value $d[i]$ is equivalent to finding the **maximum value in a prefix** of the array $t[]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(t[0 \dots a[i] - 1] + 1\right)$$

    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. 
    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).

    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:
    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.
    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).
    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.

    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:
    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.
    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).

    ## Related tasks

    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.

    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence

    This is in fact nearly the same problem.
    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.

    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.
    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.

    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences

    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.
    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.

    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.
    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.

    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \log n)$.

    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.

    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence

    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.

    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    **Proof**:
    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.

    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.
    We need to prove that $x = y$.

    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.
    Therefore we have $y \ge x$.

    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.
    Suppose that $y > x$.
    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.
    We transform this in set in the following way:
    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.
    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.
    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.

    Thus it follows that $y = x$.

    **Restoring the sequences**:
    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.
    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.

   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and a tuple, and appends the elements of the list to the tuple, returning a new tuple that contains all the original elements of the tuple followed by the elements of the list.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: 
   To solve this problem, we can convert the tuple into a list, append the elements of the given list to this new list, and then convert the list back into a tuple before returning it. This approach allows us to easily combine the elements of both the tuple and the list.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function add_lists(list, tuple):
       convert tuple to list
       append each element of list to the new list
       convert the new list back to a tuple
       return the new tuple
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def add_lists(lst, tup):
    # Convert the tuple to a list
    result = list(tup)
    # Append each element of the list to the result list
    for item in lst:
        result.append(item)
    # Convert the result list back to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
```
