    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a Python function that calculates the product of all elements in a given list, then takes that product modulo a specified integer `n`. The function should return the result of this operation.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**:\n   - First, we will initialize a variable to hold the product, starting at 1 (since multiplying by 1 does not change the product).\n   - We will iterate through each number in the input list, multiplying it to the product variable.\n   - After processing all numbers, we will take the product modulo `n` to get the final result.\n   - Finally, we will return this result.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_remainder(arr, n):\n       initialize product to 1\n       for each number in arr:\n           product = product * number\n       return product % n\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    # Initialize the product variable\n    product = 1\n    # Iterate through each number in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        # Multiply the current number to the product\n        product *= number\n    # Return the product modulo n\n    return product % n\n```",
