\\bmod p$, without taking all the multiple factors of $p$ into account that appear in the factorial.\n    Imaging you write down the prime factorization of $n!$, remove all factors $p$, and compute the product modulo $p$.\n    We will denote this *modified* factorial with $n!_{\\%p}$.\n    For instance $7!_{\\%p} \\equiv 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{3} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\underbrace{2}_{6} \\cdot 7 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 3$.\n\n    Learning how to effectively calculate this modified factorial allows us to quickly calculate the value of the various combinatorial formulas (for example, [Binomial coefficients](../combinatorics/binomial-coefficients.md)).\n\n    ## Algorithm\n    Let's write this modified factorial explicitly.\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    n!_{\\%p} &=& 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p} \\cdot (p+1) \\cdot (p+2) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (2p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{2}_{2p} \\\\\\\n     & &\\quad \\cdot (2p+1) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p^2-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p^2} \\cdot (p^2 +1) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n \\pmod{p} \\\\\\\\\n    &=& 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{2}_{2p} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\\\\\\n    & &\\quad \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p^2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (n \\bmod p) \\pmod{p}\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    It can be clearly seen that factorial is divided into several blocks of same length except for the last one.\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    n!_{\\%p}&=& \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot 1}_{1\\text{st}} \\cdot \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot 2}_{2\\text{nd}} \\cdot \\ldots \\\\\\\\\n    & & \\cdot \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot 1}_{p\\text{th}} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\quad \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (n \\bmod p)}_{\\text{tail}} \\pmod{p}.\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    The main part of the blocks it is easy to count \u2014 it's just $(p-1)!\\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ p$.\n    We can compute that programmatically or just apply Wilson theorem which states that $(p-1)! \\bmod p = -1$ for any prime $p$.\n\n    We have exactly $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\rfloor$ such blocks, therefore we need to raise $-1$ to the power of $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\rfloor$.\n    This can be done in logarithmic time using [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md); however you can also notice that the result will switch between $-1$ and $1$, so we only need to look at the parity of the exponent and multiply by $-1$ if the parity is odd.\n    And instead of a multiplication, we can also just subtract the current result from $p$.\n\n    The value of the last partial block can be calculated separately in $O(p)$.\n\n\n    This leaves only the last element of each block.\n    If we hide the already handled elements, we can see the following pattern:\n\n    $$n!_{\\%p} = \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 1 } \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot (p-1)} \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 1 } \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 1} \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 2} \\cdots$$\n\n    This again is a *modified* factorial, only with a much smaller dimension.\n    It's $\\lfloor n / p \\rfloor !_{\\%p}$.\n\n    Thus, during the calculation of the *modified* factorial $n\\!_{\\%p}$ we did $O(p)$ operations and are left with the calculation of $\\lfloor n / p \\rfloor !_{\\%p}$.\n    We have a recursive formula.\n    The recursion depth is $O(\\log_p n)$, and therefore the complete asymptotic behavior of the algorithm is $O(p \\log_p n)$.\n\n    Notice, if you precompute the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ 2!,~ \\dots,~ (p-1)!$ modulo $p$, then the complexity will just be $O(\\log_p n)$.\n\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    We don't need recursion because this is a case of tail recursion and thus can be easily implemented using iteration.\n    In the following implementation we precompute the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ \\dots,~ (p-1)!$, and thus have the runtime $O(p + \\log_p n)$.\n    If you need to call the function multiple times, then you can do the precomputation outside of the function and do the computation of $n!_{\\%p}$ in $O(\\log_p n)$ time.\n\n    ```cpp\n    int factmod(int n, int p) {\n        vector<int> f(p);\n        f[0] = 1;\n        for (int i = 1; i < p; i++)\n            f[i] = f[i-1] * i % p;\n\n        int res = 1;\n        while (n > 1) {\n            if ((n/p) % 2)\n                res = p - res;\n            res = res * f[n%p] % p;\n            n /= p;\n        }\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Alternative, if you only have limit memory and can't afford storing all factorials, you can also just remember the factorials that you need, sort them, and then compute them in one sweep by computing the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ 2!,~ \\dots,~ (p-1)!$ in a loop without storing them explicitly.\n\n    ## Multiplicity of $p$\n\n    If we want to compute a Binomial coefficient modulo $p$, then we additionally need the multiplicity of the $p$ in $n$, i.e. the number of times $p$ occurs in the prime factorization of $n$, or number of times we erased $p$ during the computation of the *modified* factorial.\n\n    [Legendre's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula) gives us a way to compute this in $O(\\log_p n)$ time.\n    The formula gives the multiplicity $\\nu_p$ as:\n\n    $$\\nu_p(n!) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^i} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\n    Thus we get the implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int multiplicity_factorial(int n, int p) {\n        int count = 0;\n        do {\n            n /= p;\n            count += n;\n        } while (n);\n        return count;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can be proven very easily using the same ideas that we did in the previous sections.\n    Remove all elements that don't contain the factor $p$.\n    This leaves $\\lfloor n/p \\rfloor$ element remaining.\n    If we remove the factor $p$ from each of them, we get the product $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdots \\lfloor n/p \\rfloor = \\lfloor n/p \\rfloor !$, and again we have a recursion.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Linear Congruence Equation\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Linear Congruence Equation\n\n    This equation is of the form:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x \\equiv b \\pmod n,$$\n\n    where $a$, $b$ and $n$ are given integers and $x$ is an unknown integer.\n\n    It is required to find the value $x$ from the interval $[0, n-1]$ (clearly, on the entire number line there can be infinitely many solutions that will differ from each other in $n \\cdot k$ , where $k$ is any integer). If the solution is not unique, then we will consider how to get all the solutions.\n\n    ## Solution by finding the inverse element\n\n    Let us first consider a simpler case where $a$ and $n$ are **coprime** ($\\gcd(a, n) = 1$).\n    Then one can find the [inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$, and multiplying both sides of the equation with the inverse, and we can get a **unique** solution.\n\n    $$x \\equiv b \\cdot a ^ {- 1} \\pmod n$$\n\n    Now consider the case where $a$ and $n$ are **not coprime** ($\\gcd(a, n) \\ne 1$).\n    Then the solution will not always exist (for example $2 \\cdot x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ has no solution).\n\n    Let $g = \\gcd(a, n)$, i.e. the [greatest common divisor](euclid-algorithm.md) of $a$ and $n$ (which in this case is greater than one).\n\n    Then, if $b$ is not divisible by $g$, there is no solution. In fact, for any $x$ the left side of the equation $a \\cdot x \\pmod n$ , is always divisible by $g$, while the right-hand side is not divisible by it, hence it follows that there are no solutions.\n\n    If $g$ divides $b$, then by dividing both sides of the equation by $g$ (i.e. dividing $a$, $b$ and $n$ by $g$), we receive a new equation:\n\n    $$a^\\prime \\cdot x \\equiv b^\\prime \\pmod{n^\\prime}$$\n\n    in which $a^\\prime$ and $n^\\prime$ are already relatively prime, and we have already learned how to handle such an equation.\n    We get $x^\\prime$ as solution for $x$.\n\n    It is clear that this $x^\\prime$ will also be a solution of the original equation.\n    However it will **not be the only solution**.\n    It can be shown that the original equation has exactly $g$ solutions, and they will look like this:\n\n    $$x_i \\equiv (x^\\prime + i\\cdot n^\\prime) \\pmod n \\quad \\text{for } i = 0 \\ldots g-1$$\n\n    Summarizing, we can say that the **number of solutions** of the linear congruence equation is equal to either $g = \\gcd(a, n)$ or to zero.\n\n    ## Solution with the Extended Euclidean Algorithm\n\n    We can rewrite the linear congruence to the following Diophantine equation:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x + n \\cdot k = b,$$\n\n    where $x$ and $k$ are unknown integers.\n\n    The method of solving this equation is described in the corresponding article [Linear Diophantine equations](linear-diophantine-equation.md) and it consists of applying the [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md).\n\n    It also describes the method of obtaining all solutions of this equation from one found solution, and incidentally this method, when carefully considered, is absolutely equivalent to the method described in the previous section.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Euler's totient function\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Euler's totient function\n\n    Euler's totient function, also known as **phi-function** $\\phi (n)$, counts the number of integers between 1 and $n$ inclusive, which are coprime to $n$. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals $1$ ($1$ is considered to be coprime to any number).\n\n    Here are values of $\\phi(n)$ for the first few positive integers:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n    \\hline\n    n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 21 \\\\\\\\ \\hline\n    \\phi(n) & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 4 & 6 & 4 & 10 & 4 & 12 & 6 & 8 & 8 & 16 & 6 & 18 & 8 & 12 \\\\\\\\ \\hline\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    ## Properties\n\n    The following properties of Euler totient function are sufficient to calculate it for any number:\n\n      - If $p$ is a prime number, then $\\gcd(p, q) = 1$ for all $1 \\le q < p$. Therefore we have:\n  \n    $$\\phi (p) = p - 1.$$\n\n      - If $p$ is a prime number and $k \\ge 1$, then there are exactly $p^k / p$ numbers between $1$ and $p^k$ that are divisible by $p$.\n        Which gives us:\n    \n    $$\\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}.$$\n\n      - If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, then:\n    \n        \\[\\phi(a b) = \\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi(b).\\]\n    \n        This relation is not trivial to see. It follows from the [Chinese remainder theorem](chinese-remainder-theorem.md). The Chinese remainder theorem guarantees, that for each $0 \\le x < a$ and each $0 \\le y < b$, there exists a unique $0 \\le z < a b$ with $z \\equiv x \\pmod{a}$ and $z \\equiv y \\pmod{b}$. It's not hard to show that $z$ is coprime to $a b$ if and only if $x$ is coprime to $a$ and $y$ is coprime to $b$. Therefore the amount of integers coprime to $a b$ is equal to product of the amounts of $a$ and $b$.\n\n      - In general, for not coprime $a$ and $b$, the equation\n\n        \\[\\phi(ab) = \\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi(b) \\cdot \\dfrac{d}{\\phi(d)}\\]\n\n        with $d = \\gcd(a, b)$ holds.\n\n    Thus, using the first three properties, we can compute $\\phi(n)$ through the factorization of $n$ (decomposition of $n$ into a product of its prime factors).\n    If $n = {p_1}^{a_1} \\cdot {p_2}^{a_2} \\cdots {p_k}^{a_k}$, where $p_i$ are prime factors of $n$,\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    \\phi (n) &= \\phi ({p_1}^{a_1}) \\cdot \\phi ({p_2}^{a_2}) \\cdots  \\phi ({p_k}^{a_k}) \\\\\\\\\n    &= \\left({p_1}^{a_1} - {p_1}^{a_1 - 1}\\right) \\cdot \\left({p_2}^{a_2} - {p_2}^{a_2 - 1}\\right) \\cdots \\left({p_k}^{a_k} - {p_k}^{a_k - 1}\\right) \\\\\\\\\n    &= p_1^{a_1} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_1}\\right) \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2}\\right) \\cdots p_k^{a_k} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_k}\\right) \\\\\\\\\n    &= n \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2}\\right) \\cdots \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_k}\\right)\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation using factorization in $O(\\sqrt{n})$:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int phi(int n) {\n        int result = n;\n        for (int i = 2;

in fact $k \\le \\log_2 m$) formula:\n\n    $$x^n \\bmod m = x^k\\left(x^{n-k \\bmod \\phi(\\frac{m}{a})} \\bmod \\frac{m}{a}\\right)\\bmod m.$$\n\n    This formula is difficult to apply, but we can use it to analyze the behavior of $x^n \\bmod m$. We can see that the sequence of powers $(x^1 \\bmod m, x^2 \\bmod m, x^3 \\bmod m, \\dots)$ enters a cycle of length $\\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right)$ after the first $k$ (or less) elements. \n    $\\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right)$ divides $\\phi(m)$ (because $a$ and $\\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime we have $\\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right) = \\phi(m)$), therefore we can also say that the period has length $\\phi(m)$.\n    And since $\\phi(m) \\ge \\log_2 m \\ge k$, we can conclude the desired, much simpler, formula:\n\n    $$ x^n \\equiv x^{\\phi(m)} x^{(n - \\phi(m)) \\bmod \\phi(m)} \\bmod m \\equiv x^{\\phi(m)+[n \\bmod \\phi(m)]} \\mod m.$$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The function should return the result of this operation.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**:\n   - First, we will initialize a variable to hold the product, starting at 1 (since multiplying by 1 does not change the product).\n   - We will iterate through each number in the input list, multiplying it to the product variable.\n   - After processing all numbers, we will take the product modulo `n` to get the final result.\n   - Finally, we will return this result.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_remainder(arr, n):\n       initialize product to 1\n       for each number in arr:\n           product = product * number\n       return product % n\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    # Initialize the product variable\n    product = 1\n    # Iterate through each number in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        # Multiply the current number to the product\n        product *= number\n    # Return the product modulo n\n    return product % n\n```"
