INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/471 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and a number `n`, then calculates the product of all the integers in the list. Finally, we return the result of that product modulo `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Start with a variable to hold the product, initialized to 1 (since multiplying by 1 does not change the product).
   - Loop through each number in the input list and multiply it to the product variable.
   - After calculating the total product, take the result modulo `n` to get the final answer.
   - Return this final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_remainder(array, n):
       product = 1
       for each number in array:
           product = product * number
       return product % n
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def find_remainder(array, n):
    # Initialize the product variable to 1
    product = 1
    
    # Loop through each number in the input array
    for number in array:
        # Multiply the current number to the product
        product *= number
    
    # Return the product modulo n
    return product % n

    Title: Factorial modulo $p$
    Part: 1/1
    # Factorial modulo $p$

    In some cases it is necessary to consider complex formulas modulo some prime $p$, containing factorials in both numerator and denominator, like such that you encounter in the formula for Binomial coefficients.
    We consider the case when $p$ is relatively small.
    This problem makes only sense when the factorials appear in both numerator and denominator of fractions.
    Otherwise $p!$ and subsequent terms will reduce to zero.
    But in fractions the factors of $p$ can cancel, and the resulting expression will be non-zero modulo $p$.

    Thus, formally the task is: You want to calculate $n! \bmod p$, without taking all the multiple factors of $p$ into account that appear in the factorial.
    Imaging you write down the prime factorization of $n!$, remove all factors $p$, and compute the product modulo $p$.
    We will denote this *modified* factorial with $n!_{\%p}$.
    For instance $7!_{\%p} \equiv 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \underbrace{1}_{3} \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \underbrace{2}_{6} \cdot 7 \equiv 2 \bmod 3$.

    Learning how to effectively calculate this modified factorial allows us to quickly calculate the value of the various combinatorial formulas (for example, [Binomial coefficients](../combinatorics/binomial-coefficients.md)).

    ## Algorithm
    Let's write this modified factorial explicitly.

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    n!_{\%p} &=& 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-2) \cdot (p-1) \cdot \underbrace{1}_{p} \cdot (p+1) \cdot (p+2) \cdot \ldots \cdot (2p-1) \cdot \underbrace{2}_{2p} \\\
     & &\quad \cdot (2p+1) \cdot \ldots \cdot (p^2-1) \cdot \underbrace{1}_{p^2} \cdot (p^2 +1) \cdot \ldots \cdot n \pmod{p} \\\\
    &=& 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-2) \cdot (p-1) \cdot \underbrace{1}_{p} \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-1) \cdot \underbrace{2}_{2p} \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \\\
    & &\quad \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-1) \cdot \underbrace{1}_{p^2} \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot \ldots \cdot (n \bmod p) \pmod{p}
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    It can be clearly seen that factorial is divided into several blocks of same length except for the last one.

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    n!_{\%p}&=& \underbrace{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-2) \cdot (p-1) \cdot 1}_{1\text{st}} \cdot \underbrace{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-2) \cdot (p-1) \cdot 2}_{2\text{nd}} \cdot \ldots \\\\
    & & \cdot \underbrace{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot (p-2) \cdot (p-1) \cdot 1}_{p\text{th}} \cdot \ldots \cdot \quad \underbrace{1 \cdot 2 \cdot \cdot \ldots \cdot (n \bmod p)}_{\text{tail}} \pmod{p}.
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    The main part of the blocks it is easy to count â€” it's just $(p-1)!\ \mathrm{mod}\ p$.
    We can compute that programmatically or just apply Wilson theorem which states that $(p-1)! \bmod p = -1$ for any prime $p$.

    We have exactly $\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \rfloor$ such blocks, therefore we need to raise $-1$ to the power of $\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \rfloor$.
    This can be done in logarithmic time using [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md); however you can also notice that the result will switch between $-1$ and $1$, so we only need to look at the parity of the exponent and multiply by $-1$ if the parity is odd.
    And instead of a multiplication, we can also just subtract the current result from $p$.

    The value of the last partial block can be calculated separately in $O(p)$.


    This leaves only the last element of each block.
    If we hide the already handled elements, we can see the following pattern:

    $$n!_{\%p} = \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot 1 } \cdot \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot 2} \cdot \ldots \cdot \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot (p-1)} \cdot \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot 1 } \cdot \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot 1} \cdot \underbrace{ \ldots \cdot 2} \cdots$$

    This again is a *modified* factorial, only with a much smaller dimension.
    It's $\lfloor n / p \rfloor !_{\%p}$.

    Thus, during the calculation of the *modified* factorial $n\!_{\%p}$ we did $O(p)$ operations and are left with the calculation of $\lfloor n / p \rfloor !_{\%p}$.
    We have a recursive formula.
    The recursion depth is $O(\log_p n)$, and therefore the complete asymptotic behavior of the algorithm is $O(p \log_p n)$.

    Notice, if you precompute the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ 2!,~ \dots,~ (p-1)!$ modulo $p$, then the complexity will just be $O(\log_p n)$.


    ## Implementation

    We don't need recursion because this is a case of tail recursion and thus can be easily implemented using iteration.
    In the following implementation we precompute the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ \dots,~ (p-1)!$, and thus have the runtime $O(p + \log_p n)$.
    If you need to call the function multiple times, then you can do the precomputation outside of the function and do the computation of $n!_{\%p}$ in $O(\log_p n)$ time.

    ```cpp
    int factmod(int n, int p) {
        vector<int> f(p);
        f[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < p; i++)
            f[i] = f[i-1] * i % p;

        int res = 1;
        while (n > 1) {
            if ((n/p) % 2)
                res = p - res;
            res = res * f[n%p] % p;
            n /= p;
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```

    Alternative, if you only have limit memory and can't afford storing all factorials, you can also just remember the factorials that you need, sort them, and then compute them in one sweep by computing the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ 2!,~ \dots,~ (p-1)!$ in a loop without storing them explicitly.

    ## Multiplicity of $p$

    If we want to compute a Binomial coefficient modulo $p$, then we additionally need the multiplicity of the $p$ in $n$, i.e. the number of times $p$ occurs in the prime factorization of $n$, or number of times we erased $p$ during the computation of the *modified* factorial.

    [Legendre's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula) gives us a way to compute this in $O(\log_p n)$ time.
    The formula gives the multiplicity $\nu_p$ as:

    $$\nu_p(n!) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^i} \right\rfloor$$

    Thus we get the implementation:

    ```cpp
    int multiplicity_factorial(int n, int p) {
        int count = 0;
        do {
            n /= p;
            count += n;
        } while (n);
        return count;
    }
    ```

    This formula can be proven very easily using the same ideas that we did in the previous sections.
    Remove all elements that don't contain the factor $p$.
    This leaves $\lfloor n/p \rfloor$ element remaining.
    If we remove the factor $p$ from each of them, we get the product $1 \cdot 2 \cdots \lfloor n/p \rfloor = \lfloor n/p \rfloor !$, and again we have a recursion.

    Title: Linear Congruence Equation
    Part: 1/1
    # Linear Congruence Equation

    This equation is of the form:

    $$a \cdot x \equiv b \pmod n,$$

    where $a$, $b$ and $n$ are given integers and $x$ is an unknown integer.

    It is required to find the value $x$ from the interval $[0, n-1]$ (clearly, on the entire number line there can be infinitely many solutions that will differ from each other in $n \cdot k$ , where $k$ is any integer). If the solution is not unique, then we will consider how to get all the solutions.

    ## Solution by finding the inverse element

    Let us first consider a simpler case where $a$ and $n$ are **coprime** ($\gcd(a, n) = 1$).
    Then one can find the [inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$, and multiplying both sides of the equation with the inverse, and we can get a **unique** solution.

    $$x \equiv b \cdot a ^ {- 1} \pmod n$$

    Now consider the case where $a$ and $n$ are **not coprime** ($\gcd(a, n) \ne 1$).
    Then the solution will not always exist (for example $2 \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ has no solution).

    Let $g = \gcd(a, n)$, i.e. the [greatest common divisor](euclid-algorithm.md) of $a$ and $n$ (which in this case is greater than one).

    Then, if $b$ is not divisible by $g$, there is no solution. In fact, for any $x$ the left side of the equation $a \cdot x \pmod n$ , is always divisible by $g$, while the right-hand side is not divisible by it, hence it follows that there are no solutions.

    If $g$ divides $b$, then by dividing both sides of the equation by $g$ (i.e. dividing $a$, $b$ and $n$ by $g$), we receive a new equation:

    $$a^\prime \cdot x \equiv b^\prime \pmod{n^\prime}$$

    in which $a^\prime$ and $n^\prime$ are already relatively prime, and we have already learned how to handle such an equation.
    We get $x^\prime$ as solution for $x$.

    It is clear that this $x^\prime$ will also be a solution of the original equation.
    However it will **not be the only solution**.
    It can be shown that the original equation has exactly $g$ solutions, and they will look like this:

    $$x_i \equiv (x^\prime + i\cdot n^\prime) \pmod n \quad \text{for } i = 0 \ldots g-1$$

    Summarizing, we can say that the **number of solutions** of the linear congruence equation is equal to either $g = \gcd(a, n)$ or to zero.

    ## Solution with the Extended Euclidean Algorithm

    We can rewrite the linear congruence to the following Diophantine equation:

    $$a \cdot x + n \cdot k = b,$$

    where $x$ and $k$ are unknown integers.

    The method of solving this equation is described in the corresponding article [Linear Diophantine equations](linear-diophantine-equation.md) and it consists of applying the [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md).

    It also describes the method of obtaining all solutions of this equation from one found solution, and incidentally this method, when carefully considered, is absolutely equivalent to the method described in the previous section.

    Title: Euler's totient function
    Part: 1/1
    # Euler's totient function

    Euler's totient function, also known as **phi-function** $\phi (n)$, counts the number of integers between 1 and $n$ inclusive, which are coprime to $n$. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals $1$ ($1$ is considered to be coprime to any number).

    Here are values of $\phi(n)$ for the first few positive integers:

    $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 21 \\\\ \hline
    \phi(n) & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 4 & 6 & 4 & 10 & 4 & 12 & 6 & 8 & 8 & 16 & 6 & 18 & 8 & 12 \\\\ \hline
    \end{array}$$

    ## Properties

    The following properties of Euler totient function are sufficient to calculate it for any number:

      - If $p$ is a prime number, then $\gcd(p, q) = 1$ for all $1 \le q < p$. Therefore we have:
  
    $$\phi (p) = p - 1.$$

      - If $p$ is a prime number and $k \ge 1$, then there are exactly $p^k / p$ numbers between $1$ and $p^k$ that are divisible by $p$.
        Which gives us:
    
    $$\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}.$$

      - If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, then:
    
        \[\phi(a b) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b).\]
    
        This relation is not trivial to see. It follows from the [Chinese remainder theorem](chinese-remainder-theorem.md). The Chinese remainder theorem guarantees, that for each $0 \le x < a$ and each $0 \le y < b$, there exists a unique $0 \le z < a b$ with $z \equiv x \pmod{a}$ and $z \equiv y \pmod{b}$. It's not hard to show that $z$ is coprime to $a b$ if and only if $x$ is coprime to $a$ and $y$ is coprime to $b$. Therefore the amount of integers coprime to $a b$ is equal to product of the amounts of $a$ and $b$.

      - In general, for not coprime $a$ and $b$, the equation

        \[\phi(ab) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b) \cdot \dfrac{d}{\phi(d)}\]

        with $d = \gcd(a, b)$ holds.

    Thus, using the first three properties, we can compute $\phi(n)$ through the factorization of $n$ (decomposition of $n$ into a product of its prime factors).
    If $n = {p_1}^{a_1} \cdot {p_2}^{a_2} \cdots {p_k}^{a_k}$, where $p_i$ are prime factors of $n$,

    $$\begin{align}
    \phi (n) &= \phi ({p_1}^{a_1}) \cdot \phi ({p_2}^{a_2}) \cdots  \phi ({p_k}^{a_k}) \\\\
    &= \left({p_1}^{a_1} - {p_1}^{a_1 - 1}\right) \cdot \left({p_2}^{a_2} - {p_2}^{a_2 - 1}\right) \cdots \left({p_k}^{a_k} - {p_k}^{a_k - 1}\right) \\\\
    &= p_1^{a_1} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \cdots p_k^{a_k} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right) \\\\
    &= n \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \cdots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right)
    \end{align}$$

    ## Implementation

    Here is an implementation using factorization in $O(\sqrt{n})$:

    ```cpp
    int phi(int n) {
        int result = n;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                while (n % i == 0)
                    n /= i;
                result -= result / i;
            }
        }
        if (n > 1)
            result -= result / n;
        return result;
    }
    ```

    ## Euler totient function from $1$ to $n$ in $O(n \log\log{n})$ { #etf_1_to_n data-toc-label="Euler totient function from 1 to n in <script type=\"math/tex\">O(n log log n)</script>" }

    If we need all all the totient of all numbers between $1$ and $n$, then factorizing all $n$ numbers is not efficient.
    We can use the same idea as the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](sieve-of-eratosthenes.md).
    It is still based on the property shown above, but instead of updating the temporary result for each prime factor for each number, we find all prime numbers and for each one update the temporary results of all numbers that are divisible by that prime number.

    Since this approach is basically identical to the Sieve of Eratosthenes, the complexity will also be the same: $O(n \log \log n)$

    ```cpp
    void phi_1_to_n(int n) {
        vector<int> phi(n + 1);
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
            phi[i] = i;
    
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            if (phi[i] == i) {
                for (int j = i; j <= n; j += i)
                    phi[j] -= phi[j] / i;
            }
        }
    }
    ```


    ## Divisor sum property { #divsum}

    This interesting property was established by Gauss:

    $$ \sum_{d|n} \phi{(d)} = n$$

    Here the sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.

    For instance the divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10.
    Hence $\phi{(1)} + \phi{(2)} + \phi{(5)} + \phi{(10)} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10$.

    ### Finding the totient from 1 to $n$ using the divisor sum property { data-toc-label="Finding the totient from 1 to n using the divisor sum property" }

    The divisor sum property also allows us to compute the totient of all numbers between 1 and $n$.
    This implementation is a little simpler than the previous implementation based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes, however also has a slightly worse complexity: $O(n \log n)$

    ```cpp
    void phi_1_to_n(int n) {
        vector<int> phi(n + 1);
        phi[0] = 0;
        phi[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
            phi[i] = i - 1;
    
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
            for (int j = 2 * i; j <= n; j += i)
                  phi[j] -= phi[i];
    }
    ```

    ## Application in Euler's theorem { #application }

    The most famous and important property of Euler's totient function is expressed in **Euler's theorem**: 

    $$a^{\phi(m)} \equiv 1 \pmod m \quad \text{if } a \text{ and } m \text{ are relatively prime.}$$

    In the particular case when $m$ is prime, Euler's theorem turns into **Fermat's little theorem**:

    $$a^{m - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod m$$

    Euler's theorem and Euler's totient function occur quite often in practical applications, for example both are used to compute the [modular multiplicative inverse](module-inverse.md).

    As immediate consequence we also get the equivalence:

    $$a^n \equiv a^{n \bmod \phi(m)} \pmod m$$

    This allows computing $x^n \bmod m$ for very big $n$, especially if $n$ is the result of another computation, as it allows to compute $n$ under a modulo.

    ## Generalization

    There is a less known version of the last equivalence, that allows computing $x^n \bmod m$ efficiently for not coprime $x$ and $m$.
    For arbitrary $x, m$ and $n \geq \log_2 m$:

    $$x^{n}\equiv x^{\phi(m)+[n \bmod \phi(m)]} \mod m$$

    Proof:

    Let $p_1, \dots, p_t$ be common prime divisors of $x$ and $m$, and $k_i$ their exponents in $m$.
    With those we define $a = p_1^{k_1} \dots p_t^{k_t}$, which makes $\frac{m}{a}$ coprime to $x$.
    And let $k$ be the smallest number such that $a$ divides $x^k$.
    Assuming $n \ge k$, we can write:

    $$\begin{align}x^n \bmod m &= \frac{x^k}{a}ax^{n-k}\bmod m \\
    &= \frac{x^k}{a}\left(ax^{n-k}\bmod m\right) \bmod m \\
    &= \frac{x^k}{a}\left(ax^{n-k}\bmod a \frac{m}{a}\right) \bmod m \\
    &=\frac{x^k}{a} a \left(x^{n-k} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m \\
    &= x^k\left(x^{n-k} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m
    \end{align}$$

    The equivalence between the third and forth line follows from the fact that $ab \bmod ac = a(b \bmod c)$.
    Indeed if $b = cd + r$ with $r < c$, then $ab = acd + ar$ with $ar < ac$.

    Since $x$ and $\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime, we can apply Euler's theorem and get the efficient (since $k$ is very small; in fact $k \le \log_2 m$) formula:

    $$x^n \bmod m = x^k\left(x^{n-k \bmod \phi(\frac{m}{a})} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m.$$

    This formula is difficult to apply, but we can use it to analyze the behavior of $x^n \bmod m$. We can see that the sequence of powers $(x^1 \bmod m, x^2 \bmod m, x^3 \bmod m, \dots)$ enters a cycle of length $\phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)$ after the first $k$ (or less) elements. 
    $\phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)$ divides $\phi(m)$ (because $a$ and $\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime we have $\phi(a) \cdot \phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right) = \phi(m)$), therefore we can also say that the period has length $\phi(m)$.
    And since $\phi(m) \ge \log_2 m \ge k$, we can conclude the desired, much simpler, formula:

    $$ x^n \equiv x^{\phi(m)} x^{(n - \phi(m)) \bmod \phi(m)} \bmod m \equiv x^{\phi(m)+[n \bmod \phi(m)]} \mod m.$$

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/471 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   We need to create a Python function that calculates the product of all elements in a given list, then takes that product modulo a specified integer `n`. The function should return the result of this operation.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**:
   - First, we will initialize a variable to hold the product, starting at 1 (since multiplying by 1 does not change the product).
   - We will iterate through each number in the input list, multiplying it to the product variable.
   - After processing all numbers, we will take the product modulo `n` to get the final result.
   - Finally, we will return this result.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function find_remainder(arr, n):
       initialize product to 1
       for each number in arr:
           product = product * number
       return product % n
   ```

    # Initialize the product variable
    product = 1
    # Iterate through each number in the array
    for number in arr:
        # Multiply the current number to the product
