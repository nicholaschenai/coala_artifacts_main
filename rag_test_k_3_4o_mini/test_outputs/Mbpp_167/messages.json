Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n \t\n    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.\n\n    Examples:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 01010000\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n | (n-1) = 01011111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    --------------------\n    ~n        = 10100111\n    ```\n\n    ### Shift operators\n\n    There are two operators for shifting bits.\n\n    -   $\\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.\n        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\gg 2 = 101_2 \\gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\\frac{5}{2^2} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1$.\n        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.\n\n    -   $\\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.\n        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\ll 3 = 101_2 \\ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \\cdot 2^3 = 5 \\cdot 8 = 40$.\n\n        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.\n\n\n    ## Useful tricks\n\n    ### Set/flip/clear a bit\n\n    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.\n    $1 \\ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\\sim(1 \\ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.\n\n    - $n ~|~ (1 \\ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\wedge~ (1 \\ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\&~ \\sim(1 \\ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n\n    ### Check if a bit is set\n\n    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {\n        return (number >> x) & 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2\n\n    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).\n    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.\n    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {\n        return n && !(n & (n - 1));\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Clear the most-right set bit\n\n    The expression $n ~\\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.\n    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.\n    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.\n\n    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 00110100\n    n-1       = 00110011\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 00110000\n    ```\n\n    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm\n\n    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.\n\n    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    int countSetBits(int n)\n    {\n        int count = 0;\n        while (n)\n        {\n            n = n & (n - 1);\n            count++;\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Finding Power of Factorial Divisor\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Finding Power of Factorial Divisor\n\n    You are given two numbers $n$ and $k$. Find the largest power of $k$ $x$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $k^x$.\n\n    ## Prime $k$ {data-toc-label=\"Prime k\"}\n\n    Let's first consider the case of prime $k$. The explicit expression for factorial\n\n    $$n! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\ldots (n-1) \\cdot n$$\n\n    Note that every $k$-th element of the product is divisible by $k$, i.e. adds $+1$ to the answer; the number of such elements is $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k}\\Bigr\\rfloor$.\n\n    Next, every $k^2$-th element is divisible by $k^2$, i.e. adds another $+1$ to the answer (the first power of $k$ has already been counted in the previous paragraph). The number of such elements is $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^2}\\Bigr\\rfloor$.\n\n    And so on, for every $i$ each $k^i$-th element adds another $+1$ to the answer, and there are $\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^i}\\Bigr\\rfloor$ such elements.\n\n    The final answer is\n\n    $$\\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k}\\Bigr\\rfloor + \\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^2}\\Bigr\\rfloor + \\ldots + \\Bigl\\lfloor\\dfrac{n}{k^i}\\Bigr\\rfloor + \\ldots$$\n\n    This result is also known as [Legendre's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula).\n    The sum is of course finite, since only approximately the first $\\log_k n$ elements are not zeros. Thus, the runtime of this algorithm is $O(\\log_k n)$.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n\n    int fact_pow (int n, int k) {\n    \tint res = 0;\n    \twhile (n) {\n    \t\tn /= k;\n    \t\tres += n;\n    \t}\n    \treturn res;\n    }\n\n    ```\n\n    ## Composite $k$ {data-toc-label=\"Composite k\"}\n\n    The same idea can't be applied directly. Instead we can factor $k$, representing it as $k = k_1^{p_1} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot k_m^{p_m}$. For each $k_i$, we find the number of times it is present in $n!$ using the algorithm described above - let's call this value $a_i$. The answer for composite $k$ will be\n\n    $$\\min_ {i=1 \\ldots m} \\dfrac{a_i}{p_i}$$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Binary Exponentiation\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Binary Exponentiation\n\n    Binary exponentiation (also known as exponentiation by squaring) is a trick which allows to calculate $a^n$ using only $O(\\log n)$ multiplications (instead of $O(n)$ multiplications required by the naive approach).\n\n    It also has important applications in many tasks unrelated to arithmetic, since it\n    can be used with any operations that have the property of **associativity**:\n\n    $$(X \\cdot Y) \\cdot Z = X \\cdot (Y \\cdot Z)$$\n\n    Most obviously this applies to modular multiplication, to multiplication of matrices and\n    to other problems which we will discuss below.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n\n    Raising $a$ to the power of $n$ is expressed naively as multiplication by $a$ done $n - 1$ times:\n    $a^{n} = a \\cdot a \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot a$. However, this approach is not practical for large $a$ or $n$.\n\n    $a^{b+c} = a^b \\cdot a^c$ and $a^{2b} = a^b \\cdot a^b = (a^b)^2$.\n\n    The idea of binary exponentiation is, that we split the work using the binary representation of the exponent.\n\n    Let's write $n$ in base 2, for example:\n\n    $$3^{13} = 3^{1101_2} = 3^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 3^1$$\n\n    Since the number $n$ has exactly $\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor + 1$ digits in base 2, we only need to perform $O(\\log n)$ multiplications, if we know the powers $a^1, a^2, a^4, a^8, \\dots, a^{2^{\\lfloor \\log n \\rfloor}}$.\n\n    So we only need to know a fast way to compute those.\n    Luckily this is very easy, since an element in the sequence is just the square of the previous element.\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    3^1 &= 3 \\\\\n    3^2 &= \\left(3^1\\right)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\\\\n    3^4 &= \\left(3^2\\right)^2 = 9^2 = 81 \\\\\n    3^8 &= \\left(3^4\\right)^2 = 81^2 = 6561\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    So to get the final answer for $3^{13}$, we only need to multiply three of them (skipping $3^2$ because the corresponding bit in $n$ is not set):\n    $3^{13} = 6561 \\cdot 81 \\cdot 3 = 1594323$\n\n    The final complexity of this algorithm is $O(\\log n)$: we have to compute $\\log n$ powers of $a$, and then have to do at most $\\log n$ multiplications to get the final answer from them.\n\n    The following recursive approach expresses the same idea:\n\n    $$a^n = \\begin{cases}\n    1 &\\text{if } n == 0 \\\\\n    \\left(a^{\\frac{n}{2}}\\right)^2 &\\text{if } n > 0 \\text{ and } n \\text{ even}\\\\\n    \\left(a^{\\frac{n - 1}{2}}\\right)^2 \\cdot a &\\text{if } n > 0 \\text{ and } n \\text{ odd}\\\\\n    \\end{cases}$$\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    First the recursive approach, which is a direct translation of the recursive formula:\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {\n        if (b == 0)\n            return 1;\n        long long res = binpow(a, b / 2);\n        if (b % 2)\n            return res * res * a;\n        else\n            return res * res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    The second approach accomplishes the same task without recursion.\n    It computes all the powers in a loop, and multiplies the ones with the corresponding set bit in $n$.\n    Although the complexity of both approaches is identical, this approach will be faster in practice since we don't have the overhead of the recursive calls.\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {\n        long long res = 1;\n        while (b > 0) {\n            if (b & 1)\n                res = res * a;\n            a = a * a;\n            b >>= 1;\n        }\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Applications\n\n    ### Effective computation of large exponents modulo a number\n\n    **Problem:**\n    Compute $x^n \\bmod m$.\n    This is a very common operation. For instance it is used in computing the [modular multiplicative inverse](module-inverse.md).\n\n    **Solution:**\n    Since we know that the modulo operator doesn't interfere with multiplications ($a \\cdot b \\equiv (a \\bmod m) \\cdot (b \\bmod m) \\pmod m$), we can directly use the same code, and just replace every multiplication with a modular multiplication:\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long binpow(long long a, long long b, long long m) {\n        a %= m;\n        long long res = 1;\n        while (b > 0) {\n            if (b & 1)\n                res = res * a % m;\n            a = a * a % m;\n            b >>= 1;\n        }\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Note:**\n    It's possible to speed this algorithm for large $b >> m$.\n    If $m$ is a prime number $x^n \\equiv x^{n \\bmod (m-1)} \\pmod{m}$ for prime $m$, and $x^n \\equiv x^{n \\bmod{\\phi(m)}} \\pmod{m}$ for composite $m$.\n    This follows directly from Fermat's little theorem and Euler's theorem, see the article about [Modular Inverses](module-inverse.md#fermat-euler) for more details.\n\n    ### Effective computation of Fibonacci numbers\n\n    **Problem:** Compute $n$-th Fibonacci number $F_n$.\n\n    **Solution:** For more details, see the [Fibonacci Number article](fibonacci-numbers.md).\n    We will only go through an overview of the algorithm.\n    To compute the next Fibonacci number, only the two previous ones are needed, as $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.\n    We can build a $2 \\times 2$ matrix that describes this transformation:\n    the transition from $F_i$ and $F_{i+1}$ to $F_{i+1}$ and $F_{i+2}$.\n    For example, applying this transformation to the pair $F_0$ and $F_1$ would change it into $F_1$ and $F_2$.\n    Therefore, we can raise this transformation matrix to the $n$-th power to find $F_n$ in time complexity $O(\\log n)$.\n\n    ### Applying a permutation $k$ times { data-toc-label='Applying a permutation <script type=\"math/tex\">k</script> times' }\n\n    **Problem:** You are given a sequence of length $n$. Apply to it a given permutation $k$ times.\n\n    **Solution:** Simply raise the permutation to $k$-th power using binary exponentiation, and then apply it to the sequence. This will give you a time complexity of $O(n \\log k)$.\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> applyPermutation(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation) {\n        vector<int> newSequence(sequence.size());\n        for(int i = 0; i < sequence.size(); i++) {\n            newSequence[i] = sequence[permutation[i]];\n        }\n        return newSequence;\n    }\n\n    vector<int> permute(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation, long long b) {\n        while (b > 0) {\n            if (b & 1) {\n                sequence = applyPermutation(sequence, permutation);\n            }\n            permutation = applyPermutation(permutation, permutation);\n            b >>= 1;\n        }\n        return sequence;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
