Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm\n    Part: 3/4\n    ```\n\n    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\\pi$, and then compute the final answers:\n    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.\n    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.\n\n    Now let us consider the second problem.\n    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:\n    we create the string $s + \\# + t$ and compute its prefix function.\n    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\\pi[i]$ for $i \\ge n + 1$.\n    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.\n\n    ### The number of different substring in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.\n\n    We will solve this problem iteratively.\n    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.\n\n    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.\n    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.\n    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.\n\n    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.\n    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.\n    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ long.\n    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.\n\n    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \\pi_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.\n\n    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.\n\n    ### Compressing a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to find the shortest \"compressed\" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.\n\n    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.\n    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \\pi[n - 1]$.\n    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.\n\n    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.\n    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.\n    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.\n    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.\n    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.\n    And so on.\n    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.\n\n    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.\n    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.\n    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.\n\n    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.\n    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.\n    We prove it by contradiction.\n    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).\n    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.\n    Now consider the second block of the string.\n    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.\n    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.\n    Contradiction.\n\n    $$\\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \\overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$\n\n    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\\pi[7] = 5}$$\n\n    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \\Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$\n\n    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function\n\n    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \\# + t$.\n    Obviously, since $\\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.\n    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \\#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:\n\n    $$\\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \\dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \\#}_{\\text{need to store}} ~ \\underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \\dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\\text{do not need to store}}$$\n\n    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \\in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.\n\n    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.\n\n    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\\text{old}_\\pi, c) \\rightarrow \\text{new}_\\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                int j = i;\n                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])\n                    j = pi[j-1];\n                if ('a' + c == s[j])\n                    j++;\n                aut[i][c] = j;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.\n    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.\n    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])\n                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];\n                else\n                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Square root algorithms\n    Section: Integer partitions\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Integer partitions}\n\n    Some square root algorithms are based on\n    the following observation:\n    if a positive integer $n$ is represented as\n    a sum of positive integers,\n    such a sum always contains at most\n    $O(\\sqrt n)$ \\emph{distinct} numbers.\n    The reason for this is that to construct\n    a sum that contains a maximum number of distinct\n    numbers, we should choose \\emph{small} numbers.\n    If we choose the numbers $1,2,\\ldots,k$,\n    the resulting sum is\n    \\[\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}.\\]\n    Thus, the maximum amount of distinct numbers is $k = O(\\sqrt n)$.\n    Next we will discuss two problems that can be solved\n    efficiently using this observation.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Knapsack}\n\n    Suppose that we are given a list of integer weights\n    whose sum is $n$.\n    Our task is to find out all sums that can be formed using\n    a subset of the weights. For example, if the weights are\n    $\\{1,3,3\\}$, the possible sums are as follows:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]\n    \\item $0$ (empty set)\n    \\item $1$\n    \\item $3$\n    \\item $1+3=4$\n    \\item $3+3=6$\n    \\item $1+3+3=7$\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    Using the standard knapsack approach (see Chapter 7.4),\n    the problem can be solved as follows:\n    we define a function $\\texttt{possible}(x,k)$ whose value is 1\n    if the sum $x$ can be formed using the first $k$ weights,\n    and 0 otherwise.\n    Since the sum of the weights is $n$,\n    there are at most $n$ weights and\n    all values of the function can be calculated\n    in $O(n^2)$ time using dynamic programming.\n\n    However, we can make the algorithm more efficient\n    by using the fact that there are at most $O(\\sqrt n)$\n    \\emph{distinct} weights.\n    Thus, we can process the weights in groups\n    that consists of similar weights.\n    We can process each group\n    in $O(n)$ time, which yields an $O(n \\sqrt n)$ time algorithm.\n\n    The idea is to use an array that records the sums of weights\n    that can be formed using the groups processed so far.\n    The array contains $n$ elements: element $k$ is 1 if the sum\n    $k$ can be formed and 0 otherwise.\n    To process a group of weights, we scan the array\n    from left to right and record the new sums of weights that\n    can be formed using this group and the previous groups.\n\n    \\subsubsection{String construction}\n\n    Given a string \\texttt{s} of length $n$\n    and a set of strings $D$ whose total length is $m$,\n    consider the problem of counting the number of ways\n    \\texttt{s} can be formed as a concatenation of strings in $D$.\n    For example,\n    if $\\texttt{s}=\\texttt{ABAB}$ and\n    $D=\\{\\texttt{A},\\texttt{B},\\texttt{AB}\\}$,\n    there are 4 ways:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]\n    \\item $\\texttt{A}+\\texttt{B}+\\texttt{A}+\\texttt{B}$\n    \\item $\\texttt{AB}+\\texttt{A}+\\texttt{B}$\n    \\item $\\texttt{A}+\\texttt{B}+\\texttt{AB}$\n    \\item $\\texttt{AB}+\\texttt{AB}$\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    We can solve the problem using dynamic programming:\n    Let $\\texttt{count}(k)$ denote the number of ways to construct the prefix\n    $\\texttt{s}[0 \\ldots k]$ using the strings in $D$.\n    Now $\\texttt{count}(n-1)$ gives the answer to the problem,\n    and we can solve the problem in $O(n^2)$ time\n    using a trie structure.\n\n    However, we can solve the problem more efficiently\n    by using string hashing and the fact that there\n    are at most $O(\\sqrt m)$ distinct string lengths in $D$.\n    First, we construct a set $H$ that contains all\n    hash values of the strings in $D$.\n    Then, when calculating a value of $\\texttt{count}(k)$,\n    we go through all values of $p$\n    such that there is a string of length $p$ in $D$,\n    calculate the hash value of $\\texttt{s}[k-p+1 \\ldots k]$\n    and check if it belongs to $H$.\n    Since there are at most $O(\\sqrt m)$ distinct string lengths,\n    this results in an algorithm whose running time is $O(n \\sqrt m)$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Dynamic programming\n    Section: Counting tilings\n    Part: 1/1\n

(6+0.2,0+0.2) rectangle (7-0.2,2-0.2);\n\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    and the total number of solutions is 781.\n\n    The problem can be solved using dynamic programming\n    by going through the grid row by row.\n    Each row in a solution can be represented as a\n    string that contains $m$ characters from the set\n    $\\{\\sqcap, \\sqcup, \\sqsubset, \\sqsupset \\}$.\n    For example, the above solution consists of four rows\n    that correspond to the following strings:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item\n    $\\sqcap \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcap \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcap$\n    \\item\n    $\\sqcup \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup \\sqcap \\sqcap \\sqcup$\n    \\item\n    $\\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup \\sqcup \\sqcap$ \n    \\item\n    $\\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup$\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    Let $\\texttt{count}(k,x)$ denote the number of ways to\n    construct a solution for rows $1 \\ldots k$\n    of the grid such that string $x$ corresponds to row $k$.\n    It is possible to use dynamic programming here,\n    because the state of a row is constrained\n    only by the state of the previous row.\n\n    A solution is valid if row $1$ does not contain\n    the character $\\sqcup$,\n    row $n$ does not contain the character $\\sqcap$,\n    and all consecutive rows are \\emph{compatible}.\n    For example, the rows\n    $\\sqcup \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup \\sqcap \\sqcap \\sqcup$ and\n    $\\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup \\sqcup \\sqcap$ \n    are compatible, while the rows\n    $\\sqcap \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcap \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcap$ and\n    $\\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqsubset \\sqsupset \\sqcup$\n    are not compatible.\n\n    Since a row consists of $m$ characters and there are\n    four choices for each character, the number of distinct\n    rows is at most $4^m$.\n    Thus, the time complexity of the solution is\n    $O(n 4^{2m})$ because we can go through the\n    $O(4^m)$ possible states for each row,\n    and for each state, there are $O(4^m)$\n    possible states for the previous row.\n    In practice, it is a good idea to rotate the grid\n    so that the shorter side has length $m$,\n    because the factor $4^{2m}$ dominates the time complexity.\n\n    It is possible to make the solution more efficient\n    by using a more compact representation for the rows.\n    It turns out that it is sufficient to know which\n    columns of the previous row contain the upper square\n    of a vertical tile.\n    Thus, we can represent a row using only characters\n    $\\sqcap$ and $\\Box$, where $\\Box$ is a combination\n    of characters\n    $\\sqcup$, $\\sqsubset$ and $\\sqsupset$.\n    Using this representation, there are only\n    $2^m$ distinct rows and the time complexity is\n    $O(n 2^{2m})$.\n\n    As a final note, there is also a surprising direct formula\n    for calculating the number of tilings\\footnote{Surprisingly,\n    this formula was discovered in 1961 by two research teams \\cite{kas61,tem61}\n    that worked independently.}:\n    \\[ \\prod_{a=1}^{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil} \\prod_{b=1}^{\\lceil m/2 \\rceil} 4 \\cdot (\\cos^2 \\frac{\\pi a}{n + 1} + \\cos^2 \\frac{\\pi b}{m+1})\\]\n    This formula is very efficient, because it calculates\n    the number of tilings in $O(nm)$ time,\n    but since the answer is a product of real numbers,\n    a problem when using the formula is\n    how to store the intermediate results accurately.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The output should be a dictionary where each unique sublist is represented as a tuple, and the value is the count of occurrences of that sublist.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the input list and convert each sublist into a tuple (since lists are not hashable and cannot be used as dictionary keys).\n   - We will use a dictionary to keep track of how many times each tuple appears.\n   - For each tuple, if it already exists in the dictionary, we will increment its count; if it does not exist, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n   - Finally, we will return the dictionary.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function unique_sublists(input_list):\n       create an empty dictionary called count_dict\n       for each sublist in input_list:\n           convert sublist to a tuple\n           if tuple is in count_dict:\n               increment count_dict[tuple]\n           else:\n               set count_dict[tuple] to 1\n       return count_dict\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef unique_sublists(input_list):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store counts of each unique sublist\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in input_list:\n        # Convert the sublist to a tuple\n        tuple_sublist = tuple(sublist)\n        \n        # Check if the tuple is already in the dictionary\n        if tuple_sublist in count_dict:\n            # Increment the count for this tuple\n            count_dict[tuple_sublist] += 1\n        else:\n            # Add the tuple to the dictionary with a count of 1\n            count_dict[tuple_sublist] = 1\n            \n    # Return the dictionary containing counts of unique sublists\n    return count_dict\n```"
