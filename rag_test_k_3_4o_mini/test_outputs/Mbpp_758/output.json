    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and counts how many times each unique sublist appears. The output should be a dictionary where each unique sublist is represented as a tuple, and the value is the count of occurrences of that sublist.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the input list and convert each sublist into a tuple (since lists are not hashable and cannot be used as dictionary keys).\n   - We will use a dictionary to keep track of how many times each tuple appears.\n   - For each tuple, if it already exists in the dictionary, we will increment its count; if it does not exist, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n   - Finally, we will return the dictionary.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function unique_sublists(input_list):\n       create an empty dictionary called count_dict\n       for each sublist in input_list:\n           convert sublist to a tuple\n           if tuple is in count_dict:\n               increment count_dict[tuple]\n           else:\n               set count_dict[tuple] to 1\n       return count_dict\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef unique_sublists(input_list):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store counts of each unique sublist\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in input_list:\n        # Convert the sublist to a tuple\n        tuple_sublist = tuple(sublist)\n        \n        # Check if the tuple is already in the dictionary\n        if tuple_sublist in count_dict:\n            # Increment the count for this tuple\n            count_dict[tuple_sublist] += 1\n        else:\n            # Add the tuple to the dictionary with a count of 1\n            count_dict[tuple_sublist] = 1\n            \n    # Return the dictionary containing counts of unique sublists\n    return count_dict\n```",
