    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a Python function that takes a list of lists (sublists) as input and returns the length of the longest sublist among them.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each sublist in the input list, check the length of each sublist, and keep track of the maximum length found. At the end of the iteration, we will return the maximum length.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function Find_Max_Length(sublists):\n       max_length = 0\n       for each sublist in sublists:\n           current_length = length of sublist\n           if current_length > max_length:\n               max_length = current_length\n       return max_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef Find_Max_Length(sublists):\n    # Initialize the maximum length to 0\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in sublists:\n        # Get the current length of the sublist\n        current_length = len(sublist)\n        \n        # Update max_length if the current_length is greater\n        if current_length > max_length:\n            max_length = current_length\n            \n    # Return the maximum length found\n    return max_length\n```",
