are adjacent vertices on the boundary\n    of the polygon,\n    and the first and last vertex is the same, i.e., $p_1=p_n$.\n\n    For example, the area of the polygon\n    \\begin{center}\n

\\chapter{Geometry}\n\n    \\index{geometry}\n\n    In geometric problems, it is often challenging\n    to find a way to approach the problem so that\n    the solution to the problem can be conveniently implemented\n    and the number of special cases is small.\n\n    As an example, consider a problem where\n    we are given the vertices of a quadrilateral\n    (a polygon that has four vertices),\n    and our task is to calculate its area.\n    For example, a possible input for the problem is as follows:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (5,6) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[thick] (6,2) -- (5,6) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    One way to approach the problem is to divide\n    the quadrilateral into two triangles by a straight\n    line between two opposite vertices:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (5,6) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];\n\n    \\draw[thick] (6,2) -- (5,6) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);\n    \\draw[dashed,thick] (2,5) -- (6,2);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    After this, it suffices to sum the areas\n    of the triangles.\n    The area of a triangle can be calculated,\n    for example, using \\key{Heron's formula}\n    %\\footnote{Heron of Alexandria (c. 10--70) was a Greek mathematician.}\n    \\[ \\sqrt{s (s-a) (s-b) (s-c)},\\]\n    where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are the lengths\n    of the triangle's sides and\n    $s=(a+b+c)/2$.\n    \\index{Heron's formula}\n\n    This is a possible way to solve the problem,\n    but there is one pitfall:\n    how to divide the quadrilateral into triangles?\n    It turns out that sometimes we cannot just pick\n    two arbitrary opposite vertices.\n    For example, in the following situation,\n    the division line is \\emph{outside} the quadrilateral:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (3,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[thick] (6,2) -- (3,2) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);\n\n    \\draw[dashed,thick] (2,5) -- (6,2);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    However, another way to draw the line works:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (3,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[thick] (6,2) -- (3,2) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);\n\n    \\draw[dashed,thick] (3,2) -- (1,1);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    It is clear for a human which of the lines is the correct\n    choice, but the situation is difficult for a computer.\n                           \n    However, it turns out that we can solve the problem using\n    another method that is more convenient to a programmer.\n    Namely, there is a general formula\n    \\[x_1y_2-x_2y_1+x_2y_3-x_3y_2+x_3y_4-x_4y_3+x_4y_1-x_1y_4,\\]\n    that calculates the area of a quadrilateral\n    whose vertices are\n    $(x_1,y_1)$,\n    $(x_2,y_2)$,\n    $(x_3,y_3)$ and\n    $(x_4,y_4)$.\n    This formula is easy to implement, there are no special\n    cases, and we can even generalize the formula\n    to \\emph{all} polygons.\n\n    \\section{Complex numbers}\n\n    \\index{complex number}\n    \\index{point}\n    \\index{vector}\n\n    A \\key{complex number} is a number of the form $x+y i$,\n    where $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the \\key{imaginary unit}.\n    A geometric interpretation of a complex number is\n    that it represents a two-dimensional point $(x,y)$\n    or a vector from the origin to a point $(x,y)$.\n\n    For example, $4+2i$ corresponds to the\n    following point and vector:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[->,thick] (-5,0)--(5,0);\n    \\draw[->,thick] (0,-5)--(0,5);\n\n    \\draw[fill] (4,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[->,thick] (0,0)--(4-0.1,2-0.1);\n\n    \\node at (4,2.8) {$(4,2)$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\index{complex@\\texttt{complex}}\n\n    The C++ complex number class \\texttt{complex} is\n    useful when solving geometric problems.\n    Using the class we can represent points and vectors\n    as complex numbers, and the class contains tools\n    that are useful in geometry.\n\n    In the following code, \\texttt{C} is the type of\n    a coordinate and \\texttt{P} is the type of a point or a vector.\n    In addition, the code defines macros \\texttt{X} and \\texttt{Y}\n    that can be used to refer to x and y coordinates.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    typedef long long C;\n    typedef complex<C> P;\n    #define X real()\n    #define Y imag()\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    For example, the following code defines a point $p=(4,2)$\n    and prints its x and y coordinates:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P p = {4,2};\n    cout << p.X << \" \" << p.Y << \"\\n\"; // 4 2\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The following code defines vectors $v=(3,1)$ and $u=(2,2)$,\n    and after that calculates the sum $s=v+u$.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P v = {3,1};\n    P u = {2,2};\n    P s = v+u;\n    cout << s.X << \" \" << s.Y << \"\\n\"; // 5 3\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    In practice,\n    an appropriate coordinate type is usually\n    \\texttt{long long} (integer) or \\texttt{long double}\n    (real number).\n    It is a good idea to use integer whenever possible,\n    because calculations with integers are exact.\n    If real numbers are needed,\n    precision errors should be taken into account\n    when comparing numbers.\n    A safe way to check if real numbers $a$ and $b$ are equal\n    is to compare them using $|a-b|<\\epsilon$,\n    where $\\epsilon$ is a small number (for example, $\\epsilon=10^{-9}$).\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Functions}\n\n    In the following examples, the coordinate type is\n    \\texttt{long double}.\n\n    The function $\\texttt{abs}(v)$ calculates the length\n    $|v|$ of a vector $v=(x,y)$\n    using the formula $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.\n    The function can also be used for\n    calculating the distance between points\n    $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$,\n    because that distance equals the length\n    of the vector $(x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1)$.\n\n    The following code calculates the distance\n    between points $(4,2)$ and $(3,-1)$:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P a = {4,2};\n    P b = {3,-1};\n    cout << abs(b-a) << \"\\n\"; // 3.16228\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function $\\texttt{arg}(v)$ calculates the\n    angle of a vector $v=(x,y)$ with respect to the x axis.\n    The function gives the angle in radians,\n    where $r$ radians equals $180 r/\\pi$ degrees.\n    The angle of a vector that points to the right is 0,\n    and angles decrease clockwise and increase\n    counterclockwise.\n\n    The function $\\texttt{polar}(s,a)$ constructs a vector\n    whose length is $s$ and that points to an angle $a$.\n    A vector can be rotated by an angle $a$\n    by multiplying it by a vector with length 1 and angle $a$.\n\n    The following code calculates the angle of\n    the vector $(4,2)$, rotates it $1/2$ radians\n    counterclockwise, and then calculates the angle again:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P v = {4,2};\n    cout << arg(v) << \"\\n\"; // 0.463648\n    v *= polar(1.0,0.5);\n    cout << arg(v) << \"\\n\"; // 0.963648\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Basic Geometry\n    Part: 2/3\n    ```\n\n    To see the next important property we should take a look at the set of points $\\mathbf r$ for which $\\mathbf r\\cdot \\mathbf a = C$ for some fixed constant $C$.\n    You can see that this set of points is exactly the set of points for which the projection onto $\\mathbf a$ is the point $C \\cdot \\dfrac{\\mathbf a}{|\\mathbf a|}$ and they form a hyperplane orthogonal to $\\mathbf a$.\n    You can see the vector $\\mathbf a$ alongside with several such vectors having same dot product with it in 2D on the picture below:\n\n    <center>![Vectors having same dot product with a](https://i.imgur.com/eyO7St4.png)</center>\n\n    In 2D these vectors will form a line, in 3D they will form a plane.\n    Note that this result allows us to define a line in 2D as $\\mathbf r\\cdot \\mathbf n=C$ or $(\\mathbf r - \\mathbf r_0)\\cdot \\mathbf n=0$ where $\\mathbf n$ is vector orthogonal to the line and $\\mathbf r_0$ is any vector already present on the line and $C = \\mathbf r_0\\cdot \\mathbf n$.\n    In the same manner a plane can be defined in 3D.\n\n    ## Cross product\n\n    ### Definition\n\n    Assume you have three vectors $\\mathbf a$, $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ in 3D space joined in a parallelepiped as in the picture below:\n    <center>![Three vectors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Parallelepiped_volume.svg/240px-Parallelepiped_volume.svg.png)</center>\n\n    How would you calculate its volume?\n    From school we know that we should multiply the area of the base with the height, which is projection of $\\mathbf a$ onto direction orthogonal to base.\n    That means that if we define $\\mathbf b \\times \\mathbf c$ as the vector which is orthogonal to both $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ and which length is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ then $|\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times\\mathbf c)|$ will be equal to the volume of the parallelepiped.\n    For integrity we will say that $\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ will be always directed in such way that the rotation from the vector $\\mathbf b$ to the vector $\\mathbf c$ from the point of $\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ is always counter-clockwise (see the picture below).\n\n    <center>![cross product](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Cross_product_vector.svg/250px-Cross_product_vector.svg.png)</center>\n\n    This defines the cross (or vector) product $\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ of the vectors $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ and the triple product $\\mathbf a\\cdot(\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c)$ of the vectors $\\mathbf a$, $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$.\n\n    Some notable properties of cross and triple products:\n\n    1.  $\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b = -\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf a$\n    2.  $(\\alpha \\cdot \\mathbf a)\\times \\mathbf b = \\alpha \\cdot (\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b)$\n    3.  For any $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ there is exactly one vector $\\mathbf r$ such that $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf a\\cdot\\mathbf r$ for any vector $\\mathbf a$. <br>Indeed if there are two such vectors $\\mathbf r_1$ and $\\mathbf r_2$ then $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf r_1 - \\mathbf r_2)=0$ for all vectors $\\mathbf a$ which is possible only when $\\mathbf r_1 = \\mathbf r_2$.\n    4.  $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf b\\cdot (\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf a) = -\\mathbf a\\cdot( \\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf b)$\n    5.  $(\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c = \\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$.\n        Indeed for all vectors $\\mathbf r$ the chain of equations holds:\n\n        \\[\\mathbf r\\cdot( (\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c) = (\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b) \\cdot (\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) =  \\mathbf a \\cdot(\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) + \\mathbf b\\cdot(\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) = \\mathbf r\\cdot (\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c) + \\mathbf r\\cdot(\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf r\\cdot(\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c)\\]\n\n        Which proves $(\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c = \\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ due to point 3.\n\n    6.  $|\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b|=|\\mathbf a| \\cdot |\\mathbf b| \\sin \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is angle between $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$, since $|\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b|$ equals to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$. \n\n    Given all this and that the following equation holds for the unit vectors\n\n    $$\\mathbf e_x\\times \\mathbf e_x = \\mathbf e_y\\times \\mathbf e_y = \\mathbf e_z\\times \\mathbf e_z = \\mathbf 0,\\\\\n    \\mathbf e_x\\times \\mathbf e_y = \\mathbf e_z,~\\mathbf e_y\\times \\mathbf e_z = \\mathbf e_x,~\\mathbf e_z\\times \\mathbf e_x = \\mathbf e_y$$\n\n    we can calculate the cross product of $\\mathbf a = (x_1;y_1;z_1)$ and $\\mathbf b = (x_2;y_2;z_2)$ in coordinate form:\n\n    $$\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b = (x_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_x + y_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_y + z_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_z)\\times (x_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_x + y_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_y + z_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_z) =$$\n\n    $$(y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2)\\mathbf e_x  + (z_1 x_2 - x_1 z_2)\\mathbf e_y + (x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2)$$\n\n    Which also can be written in the more elegant form:\n\n    $$\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b = \\begin{vmatrix}\\mathbf e_x & \\mathbf e_y & \\mathbf e_z \\\\ x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\end{vmatrix},~a\\cdot(b\\times c) = \\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & z_3 \\end{vmatrix}$$\n\n    Here $| \\cdot |$ stands for the determinant of a matrix. \n\n    Some kind of cross product (namely the pseudo-scalar product) can also be implemented in the 2D case.\n    If we would like to calculate the area of parallelogram formed by vectors $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$ we would compute $|\\mathbf e_z\\cdot(\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b)| = |x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2|$.\n    Another way to obtain the same result is to multiply $|\\mathbf a|$ (base of parallelogram) with the height, which is the projection of vector $\\mathbf b$ onto vector $\\mathbf a$ rotated by $90^\\circ$ which in turn is $\\widehat{\\mathbf a}=(-y_1;x_1)$.\n    That is, to calculate $|\\widehat{\\mathbf a}\\cdot\\mathbf b|=|x_1y_2 - y_1 x_2|$. \n\n    If we will take the sign into consideration then the area will be positive if the rotation from $\\mathbf a$ to $\\mathbf b$ (i.e. from the view of the point of $\\mathbf e_z$) is performed counter-clockwise and negative otherwise.\n    That defines the pseudo-scalar product.\n    Note that it also equals $|\\mathbf a| \\cdot |\\mathbf b| \\sin \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is angle from $\\mathbf a$ to $\\mathbf b$ count counter-clockwise (and negative if rotation is clockwise).\n\n    Let's implement all this stuff!\n\n    ```{.cpp file=crossproduct}\n    point3d cross(point3d a, point3d b) {\n        return point3d(a.y * b.z - a.z * b.y,\n                       a.z * b.x - a.x * b.z,\n                       a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x);\n    }\n    ftype triple(point3d a, point3d b, point3d c) {\n        return dot(a, cross(b, c));\n    }\n    ftype cross(point2d a, point2d b) {\n        return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
