INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/227 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest of those three numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare the first number with the second and third numbers. We will keep track of the smallest number found during these comparisons and return it at the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   Function min_of_three(a, b, c):
       Initialize min_value to a
       If b is less than min_value:
           Set min_value to b

           Set min_value to c
       Return min_value
   ```

```python
# Define a function to find the minimum of three numbers
def min_of_three(a, b, c):
    # Initialize min_value to the first number
    min_value = a
    # Compare with the second number

    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Minimizing sums
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.

    Title: Linear Diophantine Equation
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    Once we have $l_x$ and $r_x$, it is also simple to enumerate through all the solutions. Just need to iterate through $x = l_x + k \cdot \frac{b}{g}$ for all $k \ge 0$ until $x = r_x$, and find the corresponding $y$ values using the equation $a x + b y = c$.

    ## Find the solution with minimum value of $x + y$ { data-toc-label='Find the solution with minimum value of <script type="math/tex">x + y</script>' }

    Here, $x$ and $y$ also need to be given some restriction, otherwise, the answer may become negative infinity.

    The idea is similar to previous section: We find any solution of the Diophantine equation, and then shift the solution to satisfy some conditions.

    Finally, use the knowledge of the set of all solutions to find the minimum:

    $$x' = x + k \cdot \frac{b}{g},$$

    $$y' = y - k \cdot \frac{a}{g}.$$

    Note that $x + y$ change as follows:

    $$x' + y' = x + y + k \cdot \left(\frac{b}{g} - \frac{a}{g}\right) = x + y + k \cdot \frac{b-a}{g}$$

    If $a < b$, we need to select smallest possible value of $k$. If $a > b$, we need to select the largest possible value of $k$. If $a = b$, all solution will have the same sum $x + y$.

    \subsubsection*{Diophantine equations}

    \index{Diophantine equation}

    A \key{Diophantine equation}
    %\footnote{Diophantus of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician who lived in the 3th century.}
    is an equation of the form
    \[ ax + by = c, \]
    where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants
    and the values of $x$ and $y$ should be found.
    Each number in the equation has to be an integer.
    For example, one solution for the equation
    $5x+2y=11$ is $x=3$ and $y=-2$.

    \index{extended Euclid's algorithm}

    We can efficiently solve a Diophantine equation
    by using Euclid's algorithm.
    It turns out that we can extend Euclid's algorithm
    so that it will find numbers $x$ and $y$
    that satisfy the following equation:
    \[
    ax + by = \textrm{gcd}(a,b)
    \]

    A Diophantine equation can be solved if
    $c$ is divisible by
    $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)$,
    and otherwise it cannot be solved.

    As an example, let us find numbers $x$ and $y$
    that satisfy the following equation:
    \[
    39x + 15y = 12
    \]
    The equation can be solved, because
    $\textrm{gcd}(39,15)=3$ and $3 \mid 12$.
    When Euclid's algorithm calculates the
    greatest common divisor of 39 and 15,
    it produces the following sequence of function calls:
    \[
    \textrm{gcd}(39,15) = \textrm{gcd}(15,9)
    = \textrm{gcd}(9,6) = \textrm{gcd}(6,3)
    = \textrm{gcd}(3,0) = 3 \]
    This corresponds to the following equations:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    39 - 2 \cdot 15 & = & 9 \\
    15 - 1 \cdot 9 & = & 6 \\
    9 - 1 \cdot 6 & = & 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    Using these equations, we can derive
    \[
    39 \cdot 2 + 15 \cdot (-5) = 3
    \]
    and by multiplying this by 4, the result is
    \[
    39 \cdot 8 + 15 \cdot (-20) = 12,
    \]
    so a solution to the equation is
    $x=8$ and $y=-20$.

    A solution to a Diophantine equation is not unique,
    because we can form an infinite number of solutions
    if we know one solution.
    If a pair $(x,y)$ is a solution, then also all pairs
    \[(x+\frac{kb}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)},y-\frac{ka}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)})\]
    are solutions, where $k$ is any integer.

    \subsubsection{Chinese remainder theorem}

    \index{Chinese remainder theorem}

    The \key{Chinese remainder theorem} solves
    a group of equations of the form
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    x & = & a_1 \bmod m_1 \\
    x & = & a_2 \bmod m_2 \\
    \cdots \\
    x & = & a_n \bmod m_n \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    where all pairs of $m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_n$ are coprime.

    Let $x^{-1}_m$ be the inverse of $x$ modulo $m$, and
    \[ X_k = \frac{m_1 m_2 \cdots m_n}{m_k}.\]
    Using this notation, a solution to the equations is
    \[x = a_1 X_1 {X_1}^{-1}_{m_1} + a_2 X_2 {X_2}^{-1}_{m_2} + \cdots + a_n X_n {X_n}^{-1}_{m_n}.\]
    In this solution, for each $k=1,2,\ldots,n$,
    \[a_k X_k {X_k}^{-1}_{m_k} \bmod m_k = a_k,\]
    because
    \[X_k {X_k}^{-1}_{m_k} \bmod m_k = 1.\]
    Since all other terms in the sum are divisible by $m_k$,
    they have no effect on the remainder,
    and $x \bmod m_k = a_k$.

    For example, a solution for
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    x & = & 3 \bmod 5 \\
    x & = & 4 \bmod 7 \\
    x & = & 2 \bmod 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    is
    \[ 3 \cdot 21 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 15 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 35 \cdot 2 = 263.\]

    Once we have found a solution $x$,
    we can create an infinite number of other solutions,
    because all numbers of the form
    \[x+m_1 m_2 \cdots m_n\]
    are solutions.
