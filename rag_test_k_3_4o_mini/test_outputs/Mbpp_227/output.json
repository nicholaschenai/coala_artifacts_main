    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest of those three numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare the three values using simple conditional statements. We will check each number against the others to determine which one is the smallest.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_of_three(a, b, c):\n       if a is less than b and a is less than c:\n           return a\n       else if b is less than a and b is less than c:\n           return b\n       else:\n           return c\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to find the minimum of three numbers\ndef min_of_three(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Check if 'a' is less than both 'b' and 'c'\n    if a < b and a < c:\n        return a  # 'a' is the smallest\n    # Check if 'b' is less than both 'a' and 'c'\n    elif b < a and b < c:\n        return b  # 'b' is the smallest\n    # If neither 'a' nor 'b' is the smallest, then 'c' must be the smallest\n    else:\n        return c  # 'c' is the smallest\n```",
