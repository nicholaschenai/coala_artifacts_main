It is required to find a subarray $a[l \\ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:\n\n    $$ \\max_{ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.\n    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\n    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.\n\n    ## Algorithm 1\n\n    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm is very simple.\n\n    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.\n\n    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \\ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.\n\n    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.\n\n    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.\n\n    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ \u2014 we will only need the current element from it.\n\n    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.\n\n    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        int cur = sum - min_sum;\n        if (cur > ans) {\n            ans = cur;\n            ans_l = min_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < min_sum) {\n            min_sum = sum;\n            min_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Algorithm 2\n\n    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.\n\n    **Proof:**\n\n    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum \u2014 so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.\n\n    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.\n\n    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a \"critical\" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \\ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.\n\n    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum);\n        sum = max(sum, 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        if (sum > ans) {\n            ans = sum;\n            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < 0) {\n            sum = 0;\n            minus_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Finding the nearest pair of points\n    Part: 1/3\n    # Finding the nearest pair of points\n\n    ## Problem statement\n\n    Given $n$ points on the plane. Each point $p_i$ is defined by its coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$. It is required to find among them two such points, such that the distance between them is minimal:\n\n    $$ \\min_{\\scriptstyle i, j=0 \\ldots n-1,\\atop \\scriptstyle i \\neq j } \\rho (p_i, p_j). $$\n\n    We take the usual Euclidean distances:\n\n    $$ \\rho (p_i,p_j) = \\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2} .$$\n\n    The trivial algorithm - iterating over all pairs and calculating the distance for each \u2014 works in $O(n^2)$. \n\n    The algorithm running in time $O(n \\log n)$ is described below. This algorithm was proposed by Shamos and Hoey in 1975. (Source: Ch. 5 Notes of _Algorithm Design_ by Kleinberg & Tardos, also see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4567872)) Preparata and Shamos also showed that this algorithm is optimal in the decision tree model.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n    We construct an algorithm according to the general scheme of **divide-and-conquer** algorithms: the algorithm is designed as a recursive function, to which we pass a set of points; this recursive function splits this set in half, calls itself recursively on each half, and then performs some operations to combine the answers. The operation of combining consist of  detecting the cases when one point of the optimal solution fell into one half, and the other point into the other (in this case, recursive calls from each of the halves cannot detect this pair separately). The main difficulty, as always in case of divide and conquer algorithms, lies in the effective implementation of the merging stage. If a set of $n$ points is passed to the recursive function, then the merge stage should work no more than $O(n)$, then the asymptotics of the whole algorithm $T(n)$ will be found from the equation:\n\n    $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).$$ \n\n    The solution to this equation, as is known, is $T(n) = O(n \\log n).$\n\n    So, we proceed on to the construction of the algorithm. In order to come to an effective implementation of the merge stage in the future, we will divide the set of points into two subsets, according to their $x$-coordinates: In fact, we draw some vertical line dividing the set of points into two subsets of approximately the same size. It is convenient to make such a partition as follows: We sort the points in the standard way as pairs of numbers, ie.:\n\n    $$p_i < p_j \\Longleftrightarrow (x_i < x_j) \\lor \\Big(\\left(x_i = x_j\\right) \\wedge \\left(y_i < y_j \\right) \\Big) $$\n\n    Then take the middle point after sorting $p_m (m = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor)$, and all the points before it and the $p_m$ itself are assigned to the first half, and all the points after it - to the second half:\n\n    $$A_1 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = 0 \\ldots m \\}$$\n\n    $$A_2 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = m + 1 \\ldots n-1 \\}.$$ \n\n    Now, calling recursively on each of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, we will find the answers $h_1$ and $h_2$ for each of the halves. And take the best of them: $h = \\min(h_1, h_2)$.\n\n    Now we need to make a **merge stage**, i.e. we try to find such pairs of points, for which the distance between which is less than $h$ and one point is lying in $A_1$ and the other in $A_2$.\n    It is obvious that it is sufficient to consider only those points that are separated from the vertical line by a distance less than $h$, i.e. the set $B$ of the points considered at this stage is equal to:\n\n    $$B = \\{ p_i\\ | \\ | x_i - x_m\\ | < h \\}.$$ \n\n    For each point in the set $B$, we try to find the points that are closer to it than $h$. For example, it is sufficient to consider only those points whose $y$-coordinate differs by no more than $h$. Moreover, it makes no sense to consider those points whose $y$-coordinate is greater than the $y$-coordinate of the current point. Thus, for each point $p_i$ we define the set of considered points $C(p_i)$ as follows:\n\n    $$C(p_i) = \\{ p_j\\ |\\ p_j \\in B,\\ \\ y_i - h < y_j \\le y_i \\}.$$\n\n    If we sort the points of the set $B$ by $y$-coordinate, it will be very easy to find $C(p_i)$: these are several points in a row ahead to the point $p_i$.\n\n    So, in the new notation, the **merging stage** looks like this: build a set $B$, sort the points in it by $y$-coordinate, then for each point $p_i \\in B$ consider all points $p_j \\in C(p_i)$, and for each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ calculate the distance and compare with the current best distance.\n\n    At first glance, this is still a non-optimal algorithm: it seems that the sizes of sets $C(p_i)$ will be of order $n$, and the required asymptotics will not work. However, surprisingly, it can be proved that the size of each of the sets $C(p_i)$ is a quantity $O(1)$, i.e. it does not exceed some small constant regardless of the points themselves. Proof of this fact is given in the next section.\n\n    Finally, we pay attention to the sorting, which the above algorithm contains: first,sorting by pairs $(x, y)$, and then second, sorting the elements of the set $B$ by $y$. In fact, both of these sorts inside the recursive function can be eliminated (otherwise we would not reach the $O(n)$ estimate for the **merging stage**, and the general asymptotics of the algorithm would be $O(n \\log^2 n)$). It is easy to get rid of the first sort \u2014 it is enough to perform this sort before starting the recursion: after all, the elements themselves do not change inside the recursion, so there is no need to sort again. With the second sorting a little more difficult to perform, performing it previously will not work. But, remembering the merge sort, which also works on the principle of divide-and-conquer, we can simply embed this sort in our recursion. Let recursion, taking some set of points (as we remember,ordered by pairs $(x, y)$), return the same set, but sorted by the $y$-coordinate. To do this, simply merge (in $O(n)$) the two results returned by recursive calls. This will result in a set sorted by $y$-coordinate.\n\n    ## Evaluation of the asymptotics\n\n    To show that the above algorithm is actually executed in $O(n \\log n)$, we need to prove the following fact: $|C(p_i)| = O(1)$.\n\n    So, let us consider some point $p_i$; recall that the set $C(p_i)$ is a set of points whose $y$-coordinate lies in the segment $[y_i-h; y_i]$, and, moreover, along the $x$ coordinate, the point $p_i$ itself, and all the points of the set $C(p_i)$ lie in the band width $2h$. In other words, the points we are considering $p_i$ and $C(p_i)$ lie in a rectangle of size $2h \\times h$.\n\n    Our task is to estimate the maximum number of points that can lie in this rectangle $2h \\times h$; thus, we estimate the maximum size of the set $C(p_i)$. At the same time, when evaluating, we must not forget that there may be repeated points.\n\n    Remember that $h$ was obtained from the results of two recursive calls \u2014 on sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ contains points to the left of the partition line and partially on it, $A_2$ contains the remaining points of the partition line and points to the right of it. For any pair of points from $A_1$, as well as from $A_2$, the distance can not be less than $h$ \u2014 otherwise it would mean incorrect operation of the recursive function.\n\n    To estimate the maximum number of points in the rectangle $2h \\times h$ we divide it into two squares $h \\times h$, the first square include all points $C(p_i) \\cap A_1$, and the second contains all the others, i.e. $C(p_i) \\cap A_2$. It follows from the above considerations that in each of these squares the distance between any two points is at least $h$.\n\n    We show that there are at most four points in each square. For example, this can be done as follows: divide the square into $4$ sub-squares with sides $h/2$. Then there can be no more than one point in each of these sub-squares (since even the diagonal is equal to $h / \\sqrt{2}$, which is less than $h$). Therefore, there can be no more than $4$ points in the whole square.\n\n    So, we have proved that in a rectangle $2h \\times h$ can not be more than $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ points, and, therefore, the size of the set $C(p_i)$ cannot exceed $7$, as required.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n\n    ## Related tasks\n\n    ### Finding the maximum/minimum subarray with constraints\n\n    If the problem condition imposes additional restrictions on the required segment $[l, r]$ (for example, that the length $r-l+1$ of the segment must be within the specified limits), then the described algorithm is likely to be easily generalized to these cases \u2014 anyway, the problem will still be to find the minimum in the array $s[]$ with the specified additional restrictions.\n\n    ### Two-dimensional case of the problem: search for maximum/minimum submatrix\n\n    The problem described in this article is naturally generalized to large dimensions. For example, in a two-dimensional case, it turns into a search for such a submatrix $[l_1 \\ldots r_1, l_2 \\ldots r_2]$ of a given matrix, which has the maximum sum of numbers in it.\n\n    Using the solution for the one-dimensional case, it is easy to obtain a solution in $O(n^3)$ for the two-dimensions case:\n    we iterate over all possible values of $l_1$ and $r_1$, and calculate the sums from $l_1$ to $r_1$ in each row of the matrix. Now we have the one-dimensional problem of finding the indices $l_2$ and $r_2$ in this array, which can already be solved in linear time.\n\n    **Faster** algorithms for solving this problem are known, but they are not much faster than $O(n^3)$, and are very complex (so complex that many of them are inferior to the trivial algorithm for all reasonable constraints by the hidden constant). Currently, the best known algorithm works in $O\\left(n^3 \\frac{ \\log^3 \\log n }{ \\log^2 n} \\right)$ time (T. Chan 2007 \"More algorithms for all-pairs shortest paths in weighted graphs\")\n\n    This algorithm by Chan, as well as many other results in this area, actually describe **fast matrix multiplication** (where matrix multiplication means modified multiplication: minimum is used instead of addition, and addition is used instead of multiplication). The problem of finding the submatrix with the largest sum can be reduced to the problem of finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, and this problem, in turn, can be reduced to such a multiplication of matrices.\n\n    ### Search for a subarray with a maximum/minimum average\n\n    This problem lies in finding such a segment $a[l, r]$, such that the average value is maximal:\n\n    $$ \\max_{l \\le r} \\frac{ 1 }{ r-l+1 } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    Of course, if no other conditions are imposed on the required segment $[l, r]$, then the solution will always be a segment of length $1$ at the maximum element of the array. \n    The problem only makes sense, if there are additional restrictions (for example, the length of the desired segment is bounded below).\n\n    In this case, we apply the **standard technique** when working with the problems of the average value: we will select the desired maximum average value by **binary search**.\n\n    To do this, we need to learn how to solve the following subproblem: given the number $x$, and we need to check whether there is a subarray of array $a[]$ (of course, satisfying all additional constraints of the problem), where the average value is greater than $x$.\n\n    To solve this subproblem, subtract $x$ from each element of array $a[]$. Then our subproblem actually turns into this one: whether or not there are positive sum subarrays in this array. And we already know how to solve this problem.\n\n    Thus, we obtained the solution for the asymptotic $O(T(n) \\log W)$, where $W$ is the required accuracy, $T(n)$ is the time of solving the subtask for an array of length $n$ (which may vary depending on the specific additional restrictions imposed).\n\n    ### Solving the online problem\n\n    The condition of the problem is as follows: given an array of $n$ numbers, and a number $L$. There are queries of the form $(l,r)$, and in response to each query, it is required to find a subarray of the segment $[l, r]$ of length not less than $L$ with the maximum possible arithmetic mean.\n\n    The algorithm for solving this problem is quite complex. KADR (Yaroslav Tverdokhleb) described his algorithm on the [Russian forum](http://e-maxx.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?id=410).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
