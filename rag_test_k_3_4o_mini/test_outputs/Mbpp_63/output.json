    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The goal is to find the maximum difference between the first and second elements of any tuple in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each tuple in the list, calculate the difference between the two elements of the tuple, and keep track of the maximum difference we find. We will initialize a variable to hold the maximum difference and update it whenever we find a larger difference.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_difference(tuple_list):\n       initialize max_diff to 0\n       for each tuple in tuple_list:\n           calculate the difference between the first and second elements\n           if the difference is greater than max_diff:\n               update max_diff\n       return max_diff\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_difference(tuple_list):\n    # Initialize the maximum difference to 0\n    max_diff = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for tup in tuple_list:\n        # Calculate the difference between the first and second elements\n        diff = abs(tup[0] - tup[1])\n        \n        # Update max_diff if the current difference is greater\n        if diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = diff\n            \n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_diff\n```",
