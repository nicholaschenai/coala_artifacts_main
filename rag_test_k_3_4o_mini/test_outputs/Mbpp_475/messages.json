out that this is \\emph{not} possible\n    when we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms\n    that are based on comparing array elements.\n\n    The lower bound for the time complexity\n    can be proved by considering sorting\n    as a process where each comparison of two elements\n    gives more information about the contents of the array.\n    The process creates the following tree:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) rectangle (3,1);\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (-2.5,-1.5);\n    \\draw[thick,->]

$x<y$, the process continues to the left,\n    and otherwise to the right.\n    The results of the process are the possible\n    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.\n    For this reason, the height of the tree\n    must be at least\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) = \\log_2(1)+\\log_2(2)+\\cdots+\\log_2(n).\\]\n    We get a lower bound for this sum\n    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and\n    changing the value of each element to $\\log_2(n/2)$.\n    This yields an estimate\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) \\ge (n/2) \\cdot \\log_2(n/2),\\]\n    so the height of the tree and the minimum\n    possible number of steps in a sorting\n    algorithm in the worst case\n    is at least $n \\log n$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Counting sort}\n\n    \\index{counting sort}\n\n    The lower bound $n \\log n$ does not apply to\n    algorithms that do not compare array elements\n    but use some other information.\n    An example of such an algorithm is\n    \\key{counting sort} that sorts an array in\n    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array\n    is an integer between $0 \\ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.\n\n    The algorithm creates a \\emph{bookkeeping} array,\n    whose indices are elements of the original array.\n    The algorithm iterates through the original array\n    and calculates how many times each element\n    appears in the array.\n    \\newpage\n\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at

corresponds to the following bookkeeping array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (9,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5)

example, the value at position 3\n    in the bookkeeping array is 2,\n    because the element 3 appears 2 times\n    in the original array.\n\n    Construction of the bookkeeping array\n    takes $O(n)$ time. After this, the sorted array\n    can be created in $O(n)$ time because\n    the number of occurrences of each element can be retrieved\n    from the bookkeeping array.\n    Thus, the total time complexity of counting\n    sort is $O(n)$.\n\n    Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm\n    but it can only be used when the constant $c$\n    is small enough, so that the array elements can\n    be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Sorting\n    Section: Sorting theory\n    Part: 1/2\n    \\chapter{Sorting}\n\n    \\index{sorting}\n\n    \\key{Sorting}\n    is a fundamental algorithm design problem.\n    Many efficient algorithms\n    use sorting as a subroutine,\n    because it is often easier to process\n    data if the elements are in a sorted order.\n\n    For example, the problem ''does an array contain\n    two equal elements?'' is easy to solve using sorting.\n    If the array contains two equal elements,\n    they will be next to each other after sorting,\n    so it is easy to find them.\n    Also, the problem ''what is the most frequent element\n    in an array?'' can be solved similarly.\n\n    There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are\n    also good examples of how to apply\n    different algorithm design techniques.\n    The efficient general sorting algorithms\n    work in $O(n \\log n)$ time,\n    and many algorithms that use sorting\n    as a subroutine also\n    have this time complexity.\n\n    \\section{Sorting theory}\n\n    The basic problem in sorting is as follows:\n    \\begin{framed}\n    \\noindent\n    Given an array that contains $n$ elements,\n    your task is to sort the elements\n    in increasing order.\n    \\end{framed}\n    \\noindent\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    will be as follows after sorting:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\subsubsection{$O(n^2)$ algorithms}\n\n    \\index{bubble sort}\n\n    Simple algorithms for sorting an array\n    work in $O(n^2)$ time.\n    Such algorithms are short and usually\n    consist of two nested loops.\n    A famous $O(n^2)$ time sorting algorithm\n    is \\key{bubble sort} where the elements\n    ''bubble'' in the array according to their values.\n\n    Bubble sort consists of $n$ rounds.\n    On each round, the algorithm iterates through\n    the elements of the array.\n    Whenever two consecutive elements are found\n    that are not in correct order,\n    the algorithm swaps them.\n    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) {\n            if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {\n                swap(array[j],array[j+1]);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    After the first round of the algorithm,\n    the largest element will be in the correct position,\n    and in general, after $k$ rounds, the $k$ largest\n    elements will be in the correct positions.\n    Thus, after $n$ rounds, the whole array\n    will be sorted.\n\n    For example, in the array\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\noindent\n    the first round of bubble sort swaps elements\n    as follows:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,<->] (3.5,-0.25) .. controls (3.25,-1.00) and (2.75,-1.00) ..

\\emph{consecutive}\n    elements in the array.\n    It turns out that the time complexity\n    of such an algorithm is \\emph{always}\n    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,\n    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.\n\n    A useful concept when analyzing sorting\n    algorithms is an \\key{inversion}:\n    a pair of array elements\n    $(\\texttt{array}[a],\\texttt{array}[b])$ such that\n    $a<b$ and $\\texttt{array}[a]>\\texttt{array}[b]$,\n    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at

three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.\n    The number of inversions indicates\n    how much work is needed to sort the array.\n    An array is completely sorted when\n    there are no inversions.\n    On the other hand, if the array elements\n    are in the reverse order,\n    the number of inversions is the largest possible:\n    \\[1+2+\\cdots+(n-1)=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\\]\n\n    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are\n    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion\n    from the array.\n    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only\n    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes\n    at most one inversion, and the time complexity\n    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{$O(n \\log n)$ algorithms}\n\n    \\index{merge sort}\n\n    It is possible to sort an array efficiently\n    in $O(n \\log n)$ time using algorithms\n    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.\n    One such algorithm is \\key{merge sort}\\footnote{According to \\cite{knu983},\n    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},\n    which is based on recursion.\n\n    Merge sort sorts a subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$ as follows:\n\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.\n    \\item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\\lfloor (a+b)/2 \\rfloor$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$.\n    \\item \\emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and\n    \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    into a sorted subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it\n    halves the size of the subarray at each step.\n    The recursion consists of $O(\\log n)$ levels,\n    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.\n    Merging the subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.\n\n    For example, consider sorting the following array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$9\n[/Textbook Reference

where\n    we are given $n$ tasks with durations and deadlines\n    and our task is to choose an order to perform the tasks.\n    For each task, we earn $d-x$ points\n    where $d$ is the task's deadline\n    and $x$ is the moment when we finish the task.\n    What is the largest possible total score\n    we can obtain?\n\n    For example, suppose that the tasks are as follows:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{lll}\n    task & duration & deadline \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $A$ & 4 & 2 \\\\\n    $B$ & 3 & 5 \\\\\n    $C$ & 2 & 7 \\\\\n    $D$ & 4 & 5 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n    In this case, an optimal schedule for the tasks\n    is as follows:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\draw (0, 0) rectangle (4, -1);\n        \\draw (4, 0) rectangle (10, -1);\n        \\draw (10, 0) rectangle (18, -1);\n        \\draw (18, 0) rectangle (26, -1);\n        \\node at (0.5,-0.5) {$C$};\n        \\node at (4.5,-0.5) {$B$};\n        \\node at (10.5,-0.5) {$A$};\n        \\node at (18.5,-0.5) {$D$};\n\n        \\draw (0,1.5) -- (26,1.5);\n        \\foreach \\i in {0,2,...,26}\n        {\n            \\draw (\\i,1.25) -- (\\i,1.75);\n        }\n        \\footnotesize\n        \\node at (0,2.5) {0};\n        \\node at (10,2.5) {5};\n        \\node at (20,2.5) {10};\n\n      \\end{scope}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    In this solution, $C$ yields 5 points,\n    $B$ yields 0 points, $A$ yields $-7$ points\n    and $D$ yields $-8$ points,\n    so the total score is $-10$.\n\n    Surprisingly, the optimal solution to the problem\n    does not depend on the deadlines at all,\n    but a correct greedy strategy is to simply\n    perform the tasks \\emph{sorted by their durations}\n    in increasing order.\n    The reason for this is that if we ever perform\n    two tasks one after another such that the first task\n    takes longer than the second task,\n    we can obtain a better solution if we swap the tasks.\n    For example, consider the following schedule:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\draw (0, 0) rectangle (8, -1);\n        \\draw (8, 0) rectangle (12, -1);\n        \\node at (0.5,-0.5) {$X$};\n        \\node at (8.5,-0.5) {$Y$};\n\n    \\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate, line width=0.3mm] (7.75,-1.5) -- (0.25,-1.5);\n    \\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate, line width=0.3mm] (11.75,-1.5) -- (8.25,-1.5);\n\n    \\footnotesize\n    \\node at (4,-2.5) {$a$};\n    \\node at (10,-2.5) {$b$};\n\n      \\end{scope}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    Here $a>b$, so we should swap the tasks:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\draw (0, 0) rectangle (4, -1);\n        \\draw (4, 0) rectangle (12, -1);\n        \\node at (0.5,-0.5) {$Y$};\n        \\node at (4.5,-0.5) {$X$};\n\n    \\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate, line width=0.3mm] (3.75,-1.5) -- (0.25,-1.5);\n    \\draw [decoration={brace}, decorate, line width=0.3mm] (11.75,-1.5) -- (4.25,-1.5);\n\n    \\footnotesize\n    \\node at (2,-2.5) {$b$};\n    \\node at (8,-2.5) {$a$};\n\n      \\end{scope}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    Now $X$ gives $b$ points less and $Y$ gives $a$ points more,\n    so the total score increases by $a-b > 0$.\n    In an optimal solution,\n    for any two consecutive tasks,\n    it must hold that the shorter task comes\n    before the longer task.\n    Thus, the tasks must be performed\n    sorted by their durations.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
