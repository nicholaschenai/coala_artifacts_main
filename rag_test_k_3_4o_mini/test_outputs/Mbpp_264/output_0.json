    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that converts a dog's age in human years to dog years. The conversion rule is that the first two years of a dog's life count as 10.5 years each, and every year after that counts as 4 years.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - If the dog's age is 0 or negative, we should return 0 since a dog cannot have a negative age.\n   - If the dog's age is 1 or 2, we multiply the age by 10.5 to get the dog's age in dog years.\n   - For ages greater than 2, we calculate the first two years as 21 (2 * 10.5) and then add 4 years for each additional year beyond the second year.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function dog_age(human_years):\n       if human_years <= 0:\n           return 0\n       if human_years == 1 or human_years == 2:\n           return human_years * 10.5\n       else:\n           return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef dog_age(human_years):\n    # Check if the input age is less than or equal to 0\n    if human_years <= 0:\n        return 0  # Return 0 for non-positive ages\n    # For ages 1 and 2, calculate dog years as 10.5 years each\n    if human_years == 1 or human_years == 2:\n        return human_years * 10.5\n    # For ages greater than 2, calculate the dog years\n    else:\n        return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4  # 21 for the first two years plus 4 for each additional year\n```",
