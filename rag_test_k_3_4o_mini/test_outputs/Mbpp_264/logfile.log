INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/264 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that converts a dog's age in human years to its equivalent age in dog years. The function should take an integer input representing the dog's age in human years and return an integer representing the dog's age in dog years.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To convert human years to dog years, we can use a common formula where the first two years of a dog's life are equivalent to 10.5 human years each, and every year after that is equivalent to 4 human years. Therefore, if the dog's age is 2 years or less, we multiply the age by 10.5. If the age is greater than 2, we calculate the first two years as 21 (2 * 10.5) and then add 4 for each additional year.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function dog_age(human_years):
       if human_years <= 2:
           return human_years * 10.5
       else:
           return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4
   ```

        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.

        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    Title: Linear Diophantine Equation
    Part: 1/2
    # Linear Diophantine Equation

    A Linear Diophantine Equation (in two variables) is an equation of the general form:

    $$ax + by = c$$

    where $a$, $b$, $c$ are given integers, and $x$, $y$ are unknown integers.

    In this article, we consider several classical problems on these equations:

    * finding one solution
    * finding all solutions
    * finding the number of solutions and the solutions themselves in a given interval
    * finding a solution with minimum value of $x + y$

    ## The degenerate case

    A degenerate case that need to be taken care of is when $a = b = 0$. It is easy to see that we either have no solutions or infinitely many solutions, depending on whether $c = 0$ or not. In the rest of this article, we will ignore this case.

    ## Analytic solution

    When $a \neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$, the equation $ax+by=c$ can be equivalently treated as either of the following:

    \begin{gather}
    ax \equiv c \pmod b,\newline
    by \equiv c \pmod a.
    \end{gather}

    Without loss of generality, assume that $b \neq 0$ and consider the first equation. When $a$ and $b$ are co-prime, the solution to it is given as

    $$x \equiv ca^{-1} \pmod b,$$

    where $a^{-1}$ is the [modular inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$ modulo $b$.

    When $a$ and $b$ are not co-prime, values of $ax$ modulo $b$ for all integer $x$ are divisible by $g=\gcd(a, b)$, so the solution only exists when $c$ is divisible by $g$. In this case, one of solutions can be found by reducing the equation by $g$:

    $$(a/g) x \equiv (c/g) \pmod{b/g}.$$

    By the definition of $g$, the numbers $a/g$ and $b/g$ are co-prime, so the solution is given explicitly as

    $$\begin{cases}
    x \equiv (c/g)(a/g)^{-1}\pmod{b/g},\\
    y = \frac{c-ax}{b}.
    \end{cases}$$

    ## Algorithmic solution

    To find one solution of the Diophantine equation with 2 unknowns, you can use the [Extended Euclidean algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md). First, assume that $a$ and $b$ are non-negative. When we apply Extended Euclidean algorithm for $a$ and $b$, we can find their greatest common divisor $g$ and 2 numbers $x_g$ and $y_g$ such that:

    $$a x_g + b y_g = g$$

    If $c$ is divisible by $g = \gcd(a, b)$, then the given Diophantine equation has a solution, otherwise it does not have any solution. The proof is straight-forward: a linear combination of two numbers is divisible by their common divisor.

    Now supposed that $c$ is divisible by $g$, then we have:

    $$a \cdot x_g \cdot \frac{c}{g} + b \cdot y_g \cdot \frac{c}{g} = c$$

    Therefore one of the solutions of the Diophantine equation is:

    $$x_0 = x_g \cdot \frac{c}{g},$$

    $$y_0 = y_g \cdot \frac{c}{g}.$$

    The above idea still works when $a$ or $b$ or both of them are negative. We only need to change the sign of $x_0$ and $y_0$ when necessary.

    Finally, we can implement this idea as follows (note that this code does not consider the case $a = b = 0$):

    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_any}
    int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {
        if (b == 0) {
            x = 1;
            y = 0;
            return a;
        }
        int x1, y1;
        int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);
        x = y1;
        y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);
        return d;
    }

    bool find_any_solution(int a, int b, int c, int &x0, int &y0, int &g) {
        g = gcd(abs(a), abs(b), x0, y0);
        if (c % g) {
            return false;
        }

        x0 *= c / g;
        y0 *= c / g;
        if (a < 0) x0 = -x0;
        if (b < 0) y0 = -y0;
        return true;
    }
    ```

    ## Getting all solutions

    From one solution $(x_0, y_0)$, we can obtain all the solutions of the given equation.

    Let $g = \gcd(a, b)$ and let $x_0, y_0$ be integers which satisfy the following:

    $$a \cdot x_0 + b \cdot y_0 = c$$

    Now, we should see that adding $b / g$ to $x_0$, and, at the same time subtracting $a / g$ from $y_0$ will not break the equality:

    $$a \cdot \left(x_0 + \frac{b}{g}\right) + b \cdot \left(y_0 - \frac{a}{g}\right) = a \cdot x_0 + b \cdot y_0 + a \cdot \frac{b}{g} - b \cdot \frac{a}{g} = c$$

    Obviously, this process can be repeated again, so all the numbers of the form:

    $$x = x_0 + k \cdot \frac{b}{g}$$

    $$y = y_0 - k \cdot \frac{a}{g}$$

    are solutions of the given Diophantine equation.

    Moreover, this is the set of all possible solutions of the given Diophantine equation.

    ## Finding the number of solutions and the solutions in a given interval

    From previous section, it should be clear that if we don't impose any restrictions on the solutions, there would be infinite number of them. So in this section, we add some restrictions on the interval of $x$ and $y$, and we will try to count and enumerate all the solutions.

    Let there be two intervals: $[min_x; max_x]$ and $[min_y; max_y]$ and let's say we only want to find the solutions in these two intervals.

    Note that if $a$ or $b$ is $0$, then the problem only has one solution. We don't consider this case here.

    First, we can find a solution which have minimum value of $x$, such that $x \ge min_x$. To do this, we first find any solution of the Diophantine equation. Then, we shift this solution to get $x \ge min_x$ (using what we know about the set of all solutions in previous section). This can be done in $O(1)$.
    Denote this minimum value of $x$ by $l_{x1}$.

    Similarly, we can find the maximum value of $x$ which satisfy $x \le max_x$. Denote this maximum value of $x$ by $r_{x1}$.

    Similarly, we can find the minimum value of $y$ $(y \ge min_y)$ and maximum values of $y$ $(y \le max_y)$. Denote the corresponding values of $x$ by $l_{x2}$ and $r_{x2}$.

    The final solution is all solutions with x in intersection of $[l_{x1}, r_{x1}]$ and $[l_{x2}, r_{x2}]$. Let denote this intersection by $[l_x, r_x]$.

    Following is the code implementing this idea.
    Notice that we divide $a$ and $b$ at the beginning by $g$.
    Since the equation $a x + b y = c$ is equivalent to the equation $\frac{a}{g} x + \frac{b}{g} y = \frac{c}{g}$, we can use this one instead and have $\gcd(\frac{a}{g}, \frac{b}{g}) = 1$, which simplifies the formulas.

    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_all}
    void shift_solution(int & x, int & y, int a, int b, int cnt) {
        x += cnt * b;
        y -= cnt * a;
    }

    int find_all_solutions(int a, int b, int c, int minx, int maxx, int miny, int maxy) {
        int x, y, g;
        if (!find_any_solution(a, b, c, x, y, g))
            return 0;
        a /= g;
        b /= g;

        int sign_a = a > 0 ? +1 : -1;
        int sign_b = b > 0 ? +1 : -1;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (minx - x) / b);
        if (x < minx)
            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_b);
        if (x > maxx)
            return 0;
        int lx1 = x;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (maxx - x) / b);
        if (x > maxx)
            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_b);
        int rx1 = x;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(miny - y) / a);
        if (y < miny)
            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_a);
        if (y > maxy)
            return 0;
        int lx2 = x;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(maxy - y) / a);
        if (y > maxy)
            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_a);
        int rx2 = x;

        if (lx2 > rx2)
            swap(lx2, rx2);
        int lx = max(lx1, lx2);
        int rx = min(rx1, rx2);

        if (lx > rx)
            return 0;
        return (rx - lx) / abs(b) + 1;

The conversion rule is that the first two years of a dog's life count as 10.5 years each, and every year after that counts as 4 years.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - If the dog's age is 0 or negative, we should return 0 since a dog cannot have a negative age.
   - If the dog's age is 1 or 2, we multiply the age by 10.5 to get the dog's age in dog years.
   - For ages greater than 2, we calculate the first two years as 21 (2 * 10.5) and then add 4 years for each additional year beyond the second year.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function dog_age(human_years):
       if human_years <= 0:
           return 0
       if human_years == 1 or human_years == 2:
           return human_years * 10.5
       else:
           return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def dog_age(human_years):
    # Check if the input age is less than or equal to 0
    if human_years <= 0:
        return 0  # Return 0 for non-positive ages
    # For ages 1 and 2, calculate dog years as 10.5 years each
    if human_years == 1 or human_years == 2:
        return human_years * 10.5
    # For ages greater than 2, calculate the dog years
    else:
        return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4  # 21 for the first two years plus 4 for each additional year
