    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the length of the longest subsequence in a given string that reads the same forwards and backwards (a palindromic subsequence). For example, in the string \"TENS FOR TENS\", the longest palindromic subsequence is \"TENS\", which has a length of 5.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   To find the longest palindromic subsequence, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array where each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring from index `i` to `j`. The idea is to build this table based on the following rules:\n   - If the characters at the two ends of the substring are the same, then they can be part of the palindromic subsequence, and we can add 2 to the length of the longest palindromic subsequence found in the substring between them.\n   - If the characters are different, we take the maximum length found by either excluding the left character or the right character.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function lps(s):\n       n = length of s\n       create a 2D array dp of size n x n initialized to 0\n       \n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           dp[i][i] = 1  // each character is a palindrome of length 1\n       \n       for length from 2 to n:\n           for start from 0 to n-length:\n               end = start + length - 1\n               if s[start] == s[end]:\n                   dp[start][end] = dp[start + 1][end - 1] + 2\n               else:\n                   dp[start][end] = max(dp[start + 1][end], dp[start][end - 1])\n       \n       return dp[0][n-1]  // the length of the longest palindromic subsequence\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef lps(s: str) -> int:\n    n = len(s)\n    # Create a 2D array to store lengths of longest palindromic subsequences\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Every single character is a palindrome of length 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = 1\n    \n    # Build the dp array\n    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring\n        for start in range(n - length + 1):\n            end = start + length - 1\n            if s[start] == s[end]:\n                dp[start][end] = dp[start + 1][end - 1] + 2\n            else:\n                dp[start][end] = max(dp[start + 1][end], dp[start][end - 1])\n    \n    # The length of the longest palindromic subsequence\n    return dp[0][n - 1]\n```",
