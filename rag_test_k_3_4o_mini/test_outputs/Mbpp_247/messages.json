i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0;

The array $d$ will always be sorted: \n        $d[l-1] < d[l]$ for all $i = 1 \\dots n$.\n\n        This is trivial, as you can just remove the last element from the increasing subsequence of length $l$, and you get a increasing subsequence of length $l-1$ with a smalller ending number.\n\n    2.  The element $a[i]$ will only update at most one value $d[l]$.\n\n        This follows immediately from the above implementation.\n        There can only be one place in the array with $d[l-1] < a[i] < d[l]$.\n\n    Thus we can find this element in the array $d[]$ using [binary search](../num_methods/binary_search.md) in $O(\\log n)$.\n    In fact we can simply look in the array $d[]$ for the first number that is strictly greater than $a[i]$, and we try to update this element in the same way as the above implementation.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    This gives us the improved $O(n \\log n)$ implementation:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_method2_nlogn}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        const int INF = 1e9;\n        vector<int> d(n+1, INF);\n        d[0] = -INF;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int l = upper_bound(d.begin(), d.end(), a[i]) - d.begin();\n            if (d[l-1] < a[i] && a[i] < d[l])\n                d[l] = a[i];\n        }\n\n        int ans = 0;\n        for (int l = 0; l <= n; l++) {\n            if (d[l] < INF)\n                ans = l;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$\n\n    ## Statement\n\n    Given string $s$ with length $n$. Find all the pairs $(i, j)$ such that substring $s[i\\dots j]$ is a palindrome. String $t$ is a palindrome when $t = t_{rev}$ ($t_{rev}$ is a reversed string for $t$).\n\n    ## More precise statement\n\n    In the worst case string might have up to $O(n^2)$ palindromic substrings, and at the first glance it seems that there is no linear algorithm for this problem.\n\n    But the information about the palindromes can be kept **in a compact way**: for each position $i$ we will find the number of non-empty palindromes centered at this position.\n\n    Palindromes with a common center form a contiguous chain, that is if we have a palindrome of length $l$ centered in $i$, we also have palindromes of lengths $l-2$, $l-4$ and so on also centered in $i$. Therefore, we will collect the information about all palindromic substrings in this way.\n\n    Palindromes of odd and even lengths are accounted for separately as $d_{odd}[i]$ and $d_{even}[i]$. For the palindromes of even length we assume that they're centered in the position $i$ if their two central characters are $s[i]$ and $s[i-1]$.\n\n    For instance, string $s = abababc$ has three palindromes with odd length with centers in the position $s[3] = b$, i. e. $d_{odd}[3] = 3$:\n\n    $$a\\ \\overbrace{b\\ a\\ \\underbrace{b}_{s_3}\\ a\\ b}^{d_{odd}[3]=3} c$$\n\n    And string $s = cbaabd$ has two palindromes with even length with centers in the position $s[3] = a$, i. e. $d_{even}[3] = 2$:\n\n    $$c\\ \\overbrace{b\\ a\\ \\underbrace{a}_{s_3}\\ b}^{d_{even}[3]=2} d$$\n\n    It's a surprising fact that there is an algorithm, which is simple enough, that calculates these \"palindromity arrays\" $d_{odd}[]$ and $d_{even}[]$ in linear time. The algorithm is described in this article.\n\n    ## Solution\n\n    In general, this problem has many solutions: with [String Hashing](/string/string-hashing.html) it can be solved in $O(n\\cdot \\log n)$, and with [Suffix Trees](/string/suffix-tree-ukkonen.html) and fast LCA this problem can be solved in $O(n)$.\n\n    But the method described here is **sufficiently** simpler and has less hidden constant in time and memory complexity. This algorithm was discovered by **Glenn K. Manacher** in 1975.\n\n    Another modern way to solve this problem and to deal with palindromes in general is through the so-called palindromic tree, or eertree.\n\n    ## Trivial algorithm\n\n    To avoid ambiguities in the further description we denote what \"trivial algorithm\" is.\n\n    It's the algorithm that does the following. For each center position $i$ it tries to increase the answer by one as long as it's possible, comparing a pair of corresponding characters each time.\n\n    Such an algorithm is slow, it can calculate the answer only in $O(n^2)$.\n\n    The implementation of the trivial algorithm is:\n\n    ```cpp\n    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        s = \"$\" + s + \"^\";\n        vector<int> p(n + 2);\n        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {\n                p[i]++;\n            }\n        }\n        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

For example, in the string \"TENS FOR TENS\", the longest palindromic subsequence is \"TENS\", which has a length of 5.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   To find the longest palindromic subsequence, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array where each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring from index `i` to `j`. The idea is to build this table based on the following rules:\n   - If the characters at the two ends of the substring are the same, then they can be part of the palindromic subsequence, and we can add 2 to the length of the longest palindromic subsequence found in the substring between them.\n   - If the characters are different, we take the maximum length found by either excluding the left character or the right character.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function lps(s):\n       n = length of s\n       create a 2D array dp of size n x n initialized to 0\n       \n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           dp[i][i] = 1  // each character is a palindrome of length 1\n       \n       for length from 2 to n:\n           for start from 0 to n-length:\n               end = start + length - 1\n               if s[start] == s[end]:\n                   dp[start][end] = dp[start + 1][end - 1] + 2\n               else:\n                   dp[start][end] = max(dp[start + 1][end], dp[start][end - 1])\n       \n       return dp[0][n-1]  // the length of the longest palindromic subsequence\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef lps(s: str) -> int:\n    n = len(s)\n    # Create a 2D array to store lengths of longest palindromic subsequences\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Every single character is a palindrome of length 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = 1\n    \n    # Build the dp array\n    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring\n        for start in range(n - length + 1):\n            end = start + length - 1\n            if s[start] == s[end]:\n                dp[start][end] = dp[start + 1][end - 1] + 2\n            else:\n                dp[start][end] = max(dp[start + 1][end], dp[start][end - 1])\n    \n    # The length of the longest palindromic subsequence\n    return dp[0][n - 1]\n```"
