INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/274 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices from the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n`. The result should be the sum of these coefficients.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   The binomial coefficients can be calculated using the formula for combinations, specifically `C(n, k)`, which represents the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements. The even index coefficients are those where `k` is even (0, 2, 4, ...). To find the sum of these coefficients, we will iterate through all even indices up to `n` and sum the values of `C(n, k)` for those indices.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):
       initialize sum to 0
       for k from 0 to n:
           if k is even:
               calculate C(n, k) using the formula n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
               add C(n, k) to sum
       return sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python

    sum_even_coeffs = 0
    for k in range(0, n + 1):
        if k % 2 == 0:  # Check if k is even

    \chapter{Combinatorics}

    \index{combinatorics}

    \key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting
    combinations of objects.
    Usually, the goal is to find a way to
    count the combinations efficiently
    without generating each combination separately.

    As an example, consider the problem
    of counting the number of ways to
    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.
    For example, there are 8 representations
    for $4$:
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1+1+1+1$
    \item $1+1+2$
    \item $1+2+1$
    \item $2+1+1$
    \item $2+2$
    \item $3+1$
    \item $1+3$
    \item $4$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}

    A combinatorial problem can often be solved
    using a recursive function.
    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$
    that gives the number of representations for $n$.
    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.
    The values of the function
    can be recursively calculated as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        f(n) = \begin{cases}
                   1               & n = 0\\
                   f(0)+f(1)+\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case is $f(0)=1$,
    because the empty sum represents the number 0.
    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to
    choose the first number of the sum.
    If the first number is $k$,
    there are $f(n-k)$ representations
    for the remaining part of the sum.
    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values
    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.

    The first values for the function are:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    f(0) & = & 1 \\
    f(1) & = & 1 \\
    f(2) & = & 2 \\
    f(3) & = & 4 \\
    f(4) & = & 8 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced
    with a closed-form formula.
    In this problem,
    \[
    f(n)=2^{n-1},
    \]
    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$
    possible positions for +-signs in the sum
    and we can choose any subset of them.

    \section{Binomial coefficients}

    \index{binomial coefficient}

    The \key{binomial coefficient} ${n \choose k}$
    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset
    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.
    For example, ${5 \choose 3}=10$,
    because the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:
    \[ \{1,2,3\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,2,5\}, \{1,3,4\}, \{1,3,5\}, 
    \{1,4,5\}, \{2,3,4\}, \{2,3,5\}, \{2,4,5\}, \{3,4,5\} \]

    \subsubsection{Formula 1}

    Binomial coefficients can be
    recursively calculated as follows:

    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}
    \]

    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.
    If $x$ is included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k-1$
    elements from $n-1$ elements,
    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.

    The base cases for the recursion are
    \[
    {n \choose 0}  =  {n \choose n} = 1,
    \]
    because there is always exactly
    one way to construct an empty subset
    and a subset that contains all the elements.

    \subsubsection{Formula 2}

    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.
    \]

    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.
    We go through all permutations and always
    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation
    in the subset.
    Since the order of the elements in the subset
    and outside the subset does not matter,
    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$

    \subsubsection{Properties}

    For binomial coefficients,
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n \choose n-k},
    \]
    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into
    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements
    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.

    The sum of binomial coefficients is
    \[
    {n \choose 0}+{n \choose 1}+{n \choose 2}+\ldots+{n \choose n}=2^n.
    \]

    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''
    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to
    the $n$th power:

    \[ (a+b)^n =
    {n \choose 0} a^n b^0 + 
    {n \choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +
    \ldots + 
    {n \choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +
    {n \choose n} a^0 b^n. \]

    \index{Pascal's triangle}

    Binomial coefficients also appear in
    \key{Pascal's triangle}
    where each value equals the sum of two
    above values:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}{0.9}
    \node at (0,0) {1};
    \node at (-0.5,-0.5) {1};
    \node at (0.5,-0.5) {1};
    \node at (-1,-1) {1};
    \node at (0,-1) {2};
    \node at (1,-1) {1};
    \node at (-1.5,-1.5) {1};
    \node at (-0.5,-1.5) {3};
    \node at (0.5,-1.5) {3};
    \node at (1.5,-1.5) {1};
    \node at (-2,-2) {1};
    \node at (-1,-2) {4};

    \node at (1,-2.5) {$\ldots$};
    \node at (2,-2.5) {$\ldots$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Boxes and balls}

    ''Boxes and balls'' is a useful model,
    where we count the ways to
    place $k$ balls in $n$ boxes.
    Let us consider three scenarios:

    \textit{Scenario 1}: Each box can contain
    at most one ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 10 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --
                        (#1+0.5,#2-0.5) -- (#1+0.5,#2+0.5);
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{
        \lax{#1}{#2}{#3}
        \lax{#1+1.2}{#2}{#4}
        \lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}
        \lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}
        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{-4}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    In this scenario, the answer is directly the
    binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 2}: A box can contain multiple balls.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 15 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --

    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{

        \lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}

        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-8}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-6}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{-8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}

    \laa{16}{-8}{0}{0}{0}{0}{2}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The process of placing the balls in the boxes
    can be represented as a string
    that consists of symbols
    ''o'' and ''$\rightarrow$''.
    Initially, assume that we are standing at the leftmost box.
    The symbol ''o'' means that we place a ball
    in the current box, and the symbol
    ''$\rightarrow$'' means that we move to
    the next box to the right.

    Using this notation, each solution is a string
    that contains $k$ times the symbol ''o'' and
    $n-1$ times the symbol ''$\rightarrow$''.
    For example, the upper-right solution
    in the above picture corresponds to the string
    ''$\rightarrow$ $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$''.
    Thus, the number of solutions is
    ${k+n-1 \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 3}: Each box may contain at most one ball,
    and in addition, no two adjacent boxes may both contain a ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2

    Part: 1/2
    # Binomial Coefficients

    Binomial coefficients $\binom n k$ are the number of ways to select a set of $k$ elements from $n$ different elements without taking into account the order of arrangement of these elements (i.e., the number of unordered sets).

    Binomial coefficients are also the coefficients in the expansion of $(a + b) ^ n$ (so-called binomial theorem):

    $$ (a+b)^n = \binom n 0 a^n + \binom n 1 a^{n-1} b + \binom n 2 a^{n-2} b^2 + \cdots + \binom n k a^{n-k} b^k + \cdots + \binom n n b^n $$

    It is believed that this formula, as well as the triangle which allows efficient calculation of the coefficients, was discovered by Blaise Pascal in the 17th century. Nevertheless, it was known to the Chinese mathematician Yang Hui, who lived in the 13th century. Perhaps it was discovered by a Persian scholar Omar Khayyam. Moreover, Indian mathematician Pingala, who lived  earlier in the 3rd. BC, got similar results. The merit of the Newton is that he generalized this formula for exponents that are not natural.

    ## Calculation

    **Analytic formula** for the calculation:

    $$ \binom n k = \frac {n!} {k!(n-k)!} $$

    This formula can be easily deduced from the problem of ordered arrangement (number of ways to select $k$ different elements from $n$ different elements). First, let's count the number of ordered selections of $k$ elements. There are $n$ ways to select the first element, $n-1$ ways to select the second element, $n-2$ ways to select the third element, and so on. As a result, we get the formula of the number of ordered arrangements: $n (n-1) (n-2) \cdots (n - k + 1) = \frac {n!} {(n-k)!}$. We can easily move to unordered arrangements, noting that each unordered arrangement corresponds to exactly $k!$ ordered arrangements ($k!$ is the number of possible permutations of $k$ elements). We get the final formula by dividing $\frac {n!} {(n-k)!}$ by $k!$.

    **Recurrence formula** (which is associated with the famous "Pascal's Triangle"):

    $$ \binom n k = \binom {n-1} {k-1} + \binom {n-1} k $$

    It is easy to deduce this using the analytic formula.

    Note that for $n \lt k$ the value of $\binom n k$ is assumed to be zero.

    ## Properties

    Binomial coefficients have many different properties. Here are the simplest of them:

    *   Symmetry rule:

        \[ \binom n k = \binom n {n-k} \]

    *   Factoring in:

        \[ \binom n k = \frac n k \binom {n-1} {k-1} \]

    *   Sum over $k$:

        \[ \sum_{k = 0}^n \binom n k = 2 ^ n \]

    *   Sum over $n$:

        \[ \sum_{m = 0}^n \binom m k = \binom {n + 1} {k + 1} \]

    *   Sum over $n$ and $k$:

        \[ \sum_{k = 0}^m  \binom {n + k} k = \binom {n + m + 1} m \]

    *   Sum of the squares:

        \[ {\binom n 0}^2 + {\binom n 1}^2 + \cdots + {\binom n n}^2 = \binom {2n} n \]

    *   Weighted sum:

        \[ 1 \binom n 1 + 2 \binom n 2 + \cdots + n \binom n n = n 2^{n-1} \]

    *   Connection with the [Fibonacci numbers](../algebra/fibonacci-numbers.md):

        \[ \binom n 0 + \binom {n-1} 1 + \cdots + \binom {n-k} k + \cdots + \binom 0 n = F_{n+1} \]

    ## Calculation

    ### Straightforward calculation using analytical formula

    The first, straightforward formula is very easy to code, but this method is likely to overflow even for relatively small values of $n$ and $k$ (even if the answer completely fit into some datatype, the calculation of the intermediate factorials can lead to overflow). Therefore, this method often can only be used with [long arithmetic](../algebra/big-integer.md):

    ```cpp
    int C(int n, int k) {
        int res = 1;
        for (int i = n - k + 1; i <= n; ++i)
            res *= i;
        for (int i = 2; i <= k; ++i)
            res /= i;
        return res;
    }
    ```

    ### Improved implementation

    Note that in the above implementation numerator and denominator have the same number of factors ($k$), each of which is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, we can replace our fraction with a product $k$ fractions, each of which is real-valued. However, on each step after multiplying current answer by each of the next fractions the answer will still be integer (this follows from the property of factoring in). 

    C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int C(int n, int k) {
        double res = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i)
            res = res * (n - k + i) / i;
        return (int)(res + 0.01);
    }
    ```

    Here we carefully cast the floating point number to an integer, taking into account that due to the accumulated errors, it may be slightly less than the true value (for example, $2.99999$ instead of $3$).

    ### Pascal's Triangle

    By using the recurrence relation we can construct a table of binomial coefficients (Pascal's triangle) and take the result from it. The advantage of this method is that intermediate results never exceed the answer and calculating each new table element requires only one addition. The flaw is slow execution for large $n$ and $k$ if you just need a single value and not the whole table (because in order to calculate $\binom n k$ you will need to build a table of all $\binom i j, 1 \le i \le n, 1 \le j \le n$, or at least to $1 \le j \le \min (i, 2k)$). The time complexity can be considered to be $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.

    C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    const int maxn = ...;
    int C[maxn + 1][maxn + 1];
    C[0][0] = 1;
    for (int n = 1; n <= maxn; ++n) {
        C[n][0] = C[n][n] = 1;
        for (int k = 1; k < n; ++k)
            C[n][k] = C[n - 1][k - 1] + C[n - 1][k];
    }
    ```

    If the entire table of values is not necessary, storing only two last rows of it is sufficient (current $n$-th row and the previous $n-1$-th).

    ### Calculation in $O(1)$ {data-toc-label="Calculation in O(1)"}

    Finally, in some situations it is beneficial to precompute all the factorials in order to produce any necessary binomial coefficient with only two divisions later. This can be advantageous when using [long arithmetic](../algebra/big-integer.md), when the memory does not allow precomputation of the whole Pascal's triangle.


    ## Computing binomial coefficients modulo $m$ {data-toc-label="Computing binomial coefficients modulo m"}

    Quite often you come across the problem of computing binomial coefficients modulo some $m$.

    ### Binomial coefficient for small $n$ {data-toc-label="Binomial coefficient for small n"}

    The previously discussed approach of Pascal's triangle can be used to calculate all values of $\binom{n}{k} \bmod m$ for reasonably small $n$, since it requires time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. This approach can handle any modulo, since only addition operations are used.


    ### Binomial coefficient modulo large prime

    The formula for the binomial coefficients is

    $$\binom n k = \frac {n!} {k!(n-k)!},$$

    so if we want to compute it modulo some prime $m > n$ we get

    $$\binom n k \equiv n! \cdot (k!)^{-1} \cdot ((n-k)!)^{-1} \mod m.$$

    First we precompute all factorials modulo $m$ up to $\text{MAXN}!$ in $O(\text{MAXN})$ time.

    ```cpp
    factorial[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {
        factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % m;
    }
    ```

    And afterwards we can compute the binomial coefficient in $O(\log m)$ time.

    ```cpp
    long long binomial_coefficient(int n, int k) {
        return factorial[n] * inverse(factorial[k] * factorial[n - k] % m) % m;
    }
    ```

    We even can compute the binomial coefficient in $O(1)$ time if we precompute the inverses of all factorials in $O(\text{MAXN} \log m)$ using the regular method for computing the inverse, or even in $O(\text{MAXN})$ time using the congruence $(x!)^{-1} \equiv ((x-1)!)^{-1} \cdot x^{-1}$ and the method for [computing all inverses](../algebra/module-inverse.md#mod-inv-all-num) in $O(n)$.

    ```cpp
    long long binomial_coefficient(int n, int k) {
        return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % m * inverse_factorial[n - k] % m;
    }

    Title: Josephus Problem
    Part: 1/1
    # Josephus Problem

    ## Statement

    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.
    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. 
    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.
    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.
    The process stops when one number remains.
    It is required to find the last number.

    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).

    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.
    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \log n)$.
    We want something better though.

    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution

    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.

    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:

    $$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
    n\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\
    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\
    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\
    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\
    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\
    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\
    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\
    \end{array}$$

    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:

    $$J_{n,k} = \left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \bmod n \right) + 1$$

    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$

    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:

    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \bmod n$$

    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.

    ## Implementation

    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;
    }
    ```

    **Non-recursive form** :

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
      	  res = (res + k) % i;
        return res + 1;
    }
    ```

    This formula can also be found analytically.
    Again here we assume 0-indexing.
    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.
    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \bmod n$.
    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \ \bmod n$.

    ## Modeling a $O(k \log n)$ solution

    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.
    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$) in one run without looping over.
    Afterwards we have $n - \lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k)$-th number.
    So we have to shift by that many.
    We can notice that $\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k$ is simply $-n \bmod k$.
    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.
    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.

    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.

    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;
        if (k == 1)
            return n-1;
        if (k > n)
            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;
        int cnt = n / k;
        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);
        res -= n % k;
        if (res < 0)
            res += n;
        else
            res += res / (k - 1);
        return res;
    }
    ```

    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:

    $$ n \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) ^ x = 1, $$

    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:

    $$\ln n + x \ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) = 0,$$ 
    $$x = - \frac{\ln n}{\ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)},$$

    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:

    $$x \approx k \ln n$$

    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \log n)$.

    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$

    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.

    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):

    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$

    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:

    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$

    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, "restarting" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:

    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \left(n-2^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor} \right)$$

    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$

    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler "The Josephus Problem" and Odlyzko, Wilf "Functional iteration and the Josephus problem").

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/274 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   We need to create a Python function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices from the binomial expansion of `(1 + 1)^n`. The result should be the sum of coefficients where the index is even.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**:
   The binomial coefficients can be represented as `C(n, k)` where `k` is the index. The sum of the coefficients at even indices can be calculated by iterating through the even indices from `0` to `n` and summing up the values of `C(n, k)` for those indices. The binomial coefficient can be calculated using the formula `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)`. However, we can also use a recursive approach to calculate the coefficients without directly computing factorials.
