\\index{combinatorics}\n\n    \\key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting\n    combinations of objects.\n    Usually, the goal is to find a way to\n    count the combinations efficiently\n    without generating each combination separately.\n\n    As an example, consider the problem\n    of counting the number of ways to\n    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.\n    For example, there are 8 representations\n    for $4$:\n    \\begin{multicols}{2}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $1+1+1+1$\n    \\item $1+1+2$\n    \\item $1+2+1$\n    \\item $2+1+1$\n    \\item $2+2$\n    \\item $3+1$\n    \\item $1+3$\n    \\item $4$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{multicols}\n\n    A combinatorial problem can often be solved\n    using a recursive function.\n    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$\n    that gives the number of representations for $n$.\n    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.\n    The values of the function\n    can be recursively calculated as follows:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n                   1               & n = 0\\\\\n                   f(0)+f(1)+\\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case is $f(0)=1$,\n    because the empty sum represents the number 0.\n    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to\n    choose the first number of the sum.\n    If the first number is $k$,\n    there are $f(n-k)$ representations\n    for the remaining part of the sum.\n    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values\n    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.\n\n    The first values for the function are:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    f(0) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    f(3) & = & 4 \\\\\n    f(4) & = & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced\n    with a closed-form formula.\n    In this problem,\n    \\[\n    f(n)=2^{n-1},\n    \\]\n    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$\n    possible positions for +-signs in the sum\n    and we can choose any subset of them.\n\n    \\section{Binomial coefficients}\n\n    \\index{binomial coefficient}\n\n    The \\key{binomial coefficient} ${n \\choose k}$\n    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset\n    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, ${5 \\choose 3}=10$,\n    because the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:\n    \\[ \\{1,2,3\\}, \\{1,2,4\\}, \\{1,2,5\\}, \\{1,3,4\\}, \\{1,3,5\\}, \n    \\{1,4,5\\}, \\{2,3,4\\}, \\{2,3,5\\}, \\{2,4,5\\}, \\{3,4,5\\} \\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 1}\n\n    Binomial coefficients can be\n    recursively calculated as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k}\n    \\]\n\n    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.\n    If $x$ is included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k-1$\n    elements from $n-1$ elements,\n    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.\n\n    The base cases for the recursion are\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}  =  {n \\choose n} = 1,\n    \\]\n    because there is always exactly\n    one way to construct an empty subset\n    and a subset that contains all the elements.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 2}\n\n    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\n    \\]\n\n    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.\n    We go through all permutations and always\n    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation\n    in the subset.\n    Since the order of the elements in the subset\n    and outside the subset does not matter,\n    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$\n\n    \\subsubsection{Properties}\n\n    For binomial coefficients,\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n \\choose n-k},\n    \\]\n    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into\n    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements\n    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.\n\n    The sum of binomial coefficients is\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}+{n \\choose 1}+{n \\choose 2}+\\ldots+{n \\choose n}=2^n.\n    \\]\n\n    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''\n    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to\n    the $n$th power:\n\n    \\[ (a+b)^n =\n    {n \\choose 0} a^n b^0 + \n    {n \\choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +\n    \\ldots + \n    {n \\choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +\n    {n \\choose n} a^0 b^n. \\]\n\n

Binomial Coefficients\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Binomial Coefficients\n\n    Binomial coefficients $\\binom n k$ are the number of ways to select a set of $k$ elements from $n$ different elements without taking into account the order of arrangement of these elements (i.e., the number of unordered sets).\n\n    Binomial coefficients are also the coefficients in the expansion of $(a + b) ^ n$ (so-called binomial theorem):\n\n    $$ (a+b)^n = \\binom n 0 a^n + \\binom n 1 a^{n-1} b + \\binom n 2 a^{n-2} b^2 + \\cdots + \\binom n k a^{n-k} b^k + \\cdots + \\binom n n b^n $$\n\n    It is believed that this formula, as well as the triangle which allows efficient calculation of the coefficients, was discovered by Blaise Pascal in the 17th century. Nevertheless, it was known to the Chinese mathematician Yang Hui, who lived in the 13th century. Perhaps it was discovered by a Persian scholar Omar Khayyam. Moreover, Indian mathematician Pingala, who lived  earlier in the 3rd. BC, got similar results. The merit of the Newton is that he generalized this formula for exponents that are not natural.\n\n    ## Calculation\n\n    **Analytic formula** for the calculation:\n\n    $$ \\binom n k = \\frac {n!} {k!(n-k)!} $$\n\n    This formula can be easily deduced from the problem of ordered arrangement (number of ways to select $k$ different elements from $n$ different elements). First, let's count the number of ordered selections of $k$ elements. There are $n$ ways to select the first element, $n-1$ ways to select the second element, $n-2$ ways to select the third element, and so on. As a result, we get the formula of the number of ordered arrangements: $n (n-1) (n-2) \\cdots (n - k + 1) = \\frac {n!} {(n-k)!}$. We can easily move to unordered arrangements, noting that each unordered arrangement corresponds to exactly $k!$ ordered arrangements ($k!$ is the number of possible permutations of $k$ elements). We get the final formula by dividing $\\frac {n!} {(n-k)!}$ by $k!$.\n\n    **Recurrence formula** (which is associated with the famous \"Pascal's Triangle\"):\n\n    $$ \\binom n k = \\binom {n-1} {k-1} + \\binom {n-1} k $$\n\n    It is easy to deduce this using the analytic formula.\n\n    Note that for $n \\lt k$ the value of $\\binom n k$ is assumed to be zero.\n\n    ## Properties\n\n    Binomial coefficients have many different properties. Here are the simplest of them:\n\n    *   Symmetry rule:\n\n        \\[ \\binom n k = \\binom n {n-k} \\]\n\n    *   Factoring in:\n\n        \\[ \\binom n k = \\frac n k \\binom {n-1} {k-1} \\]\n\n    *   Sum over $k$:\n\n        \\[ \\sum_{k = 0}^n \\binom n k = 2 ^ n \\]\n\n    *   Sum over $n$:\n\n        \\[ \\sum_{m = 0}^n \\binom m k = \\binom {n + 1} {k + 1} \\]\n\n    *   Sum over $n$ and $k$:\n\n        \\[ \\sum_{k = 0}^m  \\binom {n + k} k = \\binom {n + m + 1} m \\]\n\n    *   Sum of the squares:\n\n        \\[ {\\binom n 0}^2 + {\\binom n 1}^2 + \\cdots + {\\binom n n}^2 = \\binom {2n} n \\]\n\n    *   Weighted sum:\n\n        \\[ 1 \\binom n 1 + 2 \\binom n 2 + \\cdots + n \\binom n n = n 2^{n-1} \\]\n\n    *   Connection with the [Fibonacci numbers](../algebra/fibonacci-numbers.md):\n\n        \\[ \\binom n 0 + \\binom {n-1} 1 + \\cdots + \\binom {n-k} k + \\cdots + \\binom 0 n = F_{n+1} \\]\n\n    ## Calculation\n\n    ### Straightforward calculation using analytical formula\n\n    The first, straightforward formula is very easy to code, but this method is likely to overflow even for relatively small values of $n$ and $k$ (even if the answer completely fit into some datatype, the calculation of the intermediate factorials can lead to overflow). Therefore, this method often can only be used with [long arithmetic](../algebra/big-integer.md):\n\n    ```cpp\n    int C(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 1;\n        for (int i = n - k + 1; i <= n; ++i)\n            res *= i;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= k; ++i)\n            res /= i;\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Improved implementation\n\n    Note that in the above implementation numerator and denominator have the same number of factors ($k$), each of which is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, we can replace our fraction with a product $k$ fractions, each of which is real-valued. However, on each step after multiplying current answer by each of the next fractions the answer will still be integer (this follows from the property of factoring in). \n\n    C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int C(int n, int k) {\n        double res = 1;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i)\n            res = res * (n - k + i) / i;\n        return (int)(res + 0.01);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Here we carefully cast the floating point number to an integer, taking into account that due to the accumulated errors, it may be slightly less than the true value (for example, $2.99999$ instead of $3$).\n\n    ### Pascal's Triangle\n\n    By using the recurrence relation we can construct a table of binomial coefficients (Pascal's triangle) and take the result from it. The advantage of this method is that intermediate results never exceed the answer and calculating each new table element requires only one addition. The flaw is slow execution for large $n$ and $k$ if you just need a single value and not the whole table (because in order to calculate $\\binom n k$ you will need to build a table of all $\\binom i j, 1 \\le i \\le n, 1 \\le j \\le n$, or at least to $1 \\le j \\le \\min (i, 2k)$). The time complexity can be considered to be $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.\n\n    C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    const int maxn = ...;\n    int C[maxn + 1][maxn + 1];\n    C[0][0] = 1;\n    for (int n = 1; n <= maxn; ++n) {\n        C[n][0] = C[n][n] = 1;\n        for (int k = 1; k < n; ++k)\n            C[n][k] = C[n - 1][k - 1] + C[n - 1][k];\n    }\n    ```\n\n    If the entire table of values is not necessary, storing only two last rows of it is sufficient (current $n$-th row and the previous $n-1$-th).\n\n    ### Calculation in $O(1)$ {data-toc-label=\"Calculation in O(1)\"}\n\n    Finally, in some situations it is beneficial to precompute all the factorials in order to produce any necessary binomial coefficient with only two divisions later. This can be advantageous when using [long arithmetic](../algebra/big-integer.md), when the memory does not allow precomputation of the whole Pascal's triangle.\n\n\n    ## Computing binomial coefficients modulo $m$ {data-toc-label=\"Computing binomial coefficients modulo m\"}\n\n    Quite often you come across the problem of computing binomial coefficients modulo some $m$.\n\n    ### Binomial coefficient for small $n$ {data-toc-label=\"Binomial coefficient for small n\"}\n\n    The previously discussed approach of Pascal's triangle can be used to calculate all values of $\\binom{n}{k} \\bmod m$ for reasonably small $n$, since it requires time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. This approach can handle any modulo, since only addition operations are used.\n\n\n    ### Binomial coefficient modulo large prime\n\n    The formula for the binomial coefficients is\n\n    $$\\binom n k = \\frac {n!} {k!(n-k)!},$$\n\n    so if we want to compute it modulo some prime $m > n$ we get\n\n    $$\\binom n k \\equiv n! \\cdot (k!)^{-1} \\cdot ((n-k)!)^{-1} \\mod m.$$\n\n    First we precompute all factorials modulo $m$ up to $\\text{MAXN}!$ in $O(\\text{MAXN})$ time.\n\n    ```cpp\n    factorial[0] = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= MAXN; i++) {\n        factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % m;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    And afterwards we can compute the binomial coefficient in $O(\\log m)$ time.\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long binomial_coefficient(int n, int k) {\n        return factorial[n] * inverse(factorial[k] * factorial[n - k] % m) % m;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We even can compute the binomial coefficient in $O(1)$ time if we precompute the inverses of all factorials in $O(\\text{MAXN} \\log m)$ using the regular method for computing the inverse, or even in $O(\\text{MAXN})$ time using the congruence $(x!)^{-1} \\equiv ((x-1)!)^{-1} \\cdot x^{-1}$ and the method for [computing all inverses](../algebra/module-inverse.md#mod-inv-all-num) in $O(n)$.\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long binomial_coefficient(int n, int k) {\n        return factorial[n] * inverse_factorial[k] % m * inverse_factorial[n - k] % m;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Josephus Problem\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Josephus Problem\n\n    ## Statement\n\n    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.\n    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. \n    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.\n    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.\n    The process stops when one number remains.\n    It is required to find the last number.\n\n    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).\n\n    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.\n    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The sum of the coefficients at even indices can be calculated by iterating through the even indices from `0` to `n` and summing up the values of `C(n, k)` for those indices. The binomial coefficient can be calculated using the formula `C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)`.
