It is easy to see that we either have no solutions or infinitely many solutions, depending on whether $c = 0$ or not. In the rest of this article, we will ignore this case.\n\n    ## Analytic solution\n\n    When $a \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 0$, the equation $ax+by=c$ can be equivalently treated as either of the following:\n\n    \\begin{gather}\n    ax \\equiv c \\pmod b,\\newline\n    by \\equiv c \\pmod a.\n    \\end{gather}\n\n    Without loss of generality, assume that $b \\neq 0$ and consider the first equation. When $a$ and $b$ are co-prime, the solution to it is given as\n\n    $$x \\equiv ca^{-1} \\pmod b,$$\n\n    where $a^{-1}$ is the [modular inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$ modulo $b$.\n\n    When $a$ and $b$ are not co-prime, values of $ax$ modulo $b$ for all integer $x$ are divisible by $g=\\gcd(a, b)$, so the solution only exists when $c$ is divisible by $g$. In this case, one of solutions can be found by reducing the equation by $g$:\n\n    $$(a/g) x \\equiv (c/g) \\pmod{b/g}.$$\n\n    By the definition of $g$, the numbers $a/g$ and $b/g$ are co-prime, so the solution is given explicitly as\n\n    $$\\begin{cases}\n    x \\equiv (c/g)(a/g)^{-1}\\pmod{b/g},\\\\\n    y = \\frac{c-ax}{b}.\n    \\end{cases}$$\n\n    ## Algorithmic solution\n\n    To find one solution of the Diophantine equation with 2 unknowns, you can use the [Extended Euclidean algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md). First, assume that $a$ and $b$ are non-negative. When we apply Extended Euclidean algorithm for $a$ and $b$, we can find their greatest common divisor $g$ and 2 numbers $x_g$ and $y_g$ such that:\n\n    $$a x_g + b y_g = g$$\n\n    If $c$ is divisible by $g = \\gcd(a, b)$, then the given Diophantine equation has a solution, otherwise it does not have any solution. The proof is straight-forward: a linear combination of two numbers is divisible by their common divisor.\n\n    Now supposed that $c$ is divisible by $g$, then we have:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g} + b \\cdot y_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g} = c$$\n\n    Therefore one of the solutions of the Diophantine equation is:\n\n    $$x_0 = x_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g},$$\n\n    $$y_0 = y_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g}.$$\n\n    The above idea still works when $a$ or $b$ or both of them are negative. We only need to change the sign of $x_0$ and $y_0$ when necessary.\n\n    Finally, we can implement this idea as follows (note that this code does not consider the case $a = b = 0$):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_any}\n    int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {\n        if (b == 0) {\n            x = 1;\n            y = 0;\n            return a;\n        }\n        int x1, y1;\n        int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);\n        x = y1;\n        y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);\n        return d;\n    }\n\n    bool find_any_solution(int a, int b, int c, int &x0, int &y0, int &g) {\n        g = gcd(abs(a), abs(b), x0, y0);\n        if (c % g) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        x0 *= c / g;\n        y0 *= c / g;\n        if (a < 0) x0 = -x0;\n        if (b < 0) y0 = -y0;\n        return true;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Getting all solutions\n\n    From one solution $(x_0, y_0)$, we can obtain all the solutions of the given equation.\n\n    Let $g = \\gcd(a, b)$ and let $x_0, y_0$ be integers which satisfy the following:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot y_0 = c$$\n\n    Now, we should see that adding $b / g$ to $x_0$, and, at the same time subtracting $a / g$ from $y_0$ will not break the equality:\n\n    $$a \\cdot \\left(x_0 + \\frac{b}{g}\\right) + b \\cdot \\left(y_0 - \\frac{a}{g}\\right) = a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot y_0 + a \\cdot \\frac{b}{g} - b \\cdot \\frac{a}{g} = c$$\n\n    Obviously, this process can be repeated again, so all the numbers of the form:\n\n    $$x = x_0 + k \\cdot \\frac{b}{g}$$\n\n    $$y = y_0 - k \\cdot \\frac{a}{g}$$\n\n    are solutions of the given Diophantine equation.\n\n    Moreover, this is the set of all possible solutions of the given Diophantine equation.\n\n    ## Finding the number of solutions and the solutions in a given interval\n\n    From previous section, it should be clear that if we don't impose any restrictions on the solutions, there would be infinite number of them. So in this section, we add some restrictions on the interval of $x$ and $y$, and we will try to count and enumerate all the solutions.\n\n    Let there be two intervals: $[min_x; max_x]$ and $[min_y; max_y]$ and let's say we only want to find the solutions in these two intervals.\n\n    Note that if $a$ or $b$ is $0$, then the problem only has one solution. We don't consider this case here.\n\n    First, we can find a solution which have minimum value of $x$, such that $x \\ge min_x$. To do this, we first find any solution of the Diophantine equation. Then, we shift this solution to get $x \\ge min_x$ (using what we know about the set of all solutions in previous section). This can be done in $O(1)$.\n    Denote this minimum value of $x$ by $l_{x1}$.\n\n    Similarly, we can find the maximum value of $x$ which satisfy $x \\le max_x$. Denote this maximum value of $x$ by $r_{x1}$.\n\n    Similarly, we can find the minimum value of $y$ $(y \\ge min_y)$ and maximum values of $y$ $(y \\le max_y)$. Denote the corresponding values of $x$ by $l_{x2}$ and $r_{x2}$.\n\n    The final solution is all solutions with x in intersection of $[l_{x1}, r_{x1}]$ and $[l_{x2}, r_{x2}]$. Let denote this intersection by $[l_x, r_x]$.\n\n    Following is the code implementing this idea.\n    Notice that we divide $a$ and $b$ at the beginning by $g$.\n    Since the equation $a x + b y = c$ is equivalent to the equation $\\frac{a}{g} x + \\frac{b}{g} y = \\frac{c}{g}$, we can use this one instead and have $\\gcd(\\frac{a}{g}, \\frac{b}{g}) = 1$, which simplifies the formulas.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_all}\n    void shift_solution(int & x, int & y, int a, int b, int cnt) {\n        x += cnt * b;\n        y -= cnt * a;\n    }\n\n    int find_all_solutions(int a, int b, int c, int minx, int maxx, int miny, int maxy) {\n        int x, y, g;\n        if (!find_any_solution(a, b, c, x, y, g))\n            return 0;\n        a /= g;\n        b /= g;\n\n        int sign_a = a > 0 ? +1 : -1;\n        int sign_b = b > 0 ? +1 : -1;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (minx - x) / b);\n        if (x < minx)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_b);\n        if (x > maxx)\n            return 0;\n        int lx1 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (maxx - x) / b);\n        if (x > maxx)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_b);\n        int rx1 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(miny - y) / a);\n        if (y < miny)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_a);\n        if (y > maxy)\n            return 0;\n        int lx2 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(maxy - y) / a);\n        if (y > maxy)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_a);\n        int rx2 = x;\n\n        if (lx2 > rx2)\n            swap(lx2, rx2);\n        int lx = max(lx1, lx2);\n        int rx = min(rx1, rx2);\n\n        if (lx > rx)\n            return 0;\n        return (rx - lx) / abs(b) + 1;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Operations on polynomials and series\n    Part: 1/4\n    # Operations on polynomials and series\n\n    Problems in competitive programming, especially the ones involving enumeration some kind, are often solved by reducing the problem to computing something on polynomials and formal power series.\n\n    This includes concepts such as polynomial multiplication, interpolation, and more complicated ones, such as polynomial logarithms and exponents. In this article, a brief overview of such operations and common approaches to them is presented.\n\n    ## Basic Notion and facts\n\n    In this section, we focus more on the definitions and \"intuitive\" properties of various polynomial operations. The technical details of their implementation and complexities will be covered in later sections.\n\n    ### Polynomial multiplication\n\n    !!! info \"Definition\"\n    \t**Univariate polynomial** is an expression of form $A(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \\dots + a_n x^n$.\n\n    The values $a_0, \\dots, a_n$ are polynomial coefficients, typically taken from some set of numbers or number-like structures. In this article, we assume that the coefficients are taken from some [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)), meaning that operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are well-defined for them (except for division by $0$) and they generally behave in a similar way to real numbers.\n\t\n    Typical example of such field is the field of remainders modulo prime number $p$.\n\n    For simplicity we will drop the term _univariate_, as this is the only kind of polynomials we consider in this article. We will also write $A$ instead of $A(x)$ wherever possible, which will be understandable from the context. It is assumed that either $a_n \\neq 0$ or $A(x)=0$.\n\n    !!! info \"Definition\"\n    \tThe **product** of two polynomials is defined by expanding it as an arithmetic expression:\n\n    \t$$\n    \tA(x) B(x) = \\left(\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^n a_i x^i \\right)\\left(\\sum\\limits_{j=0}^m b_j x^j\\right) = \\sum\\limits_{i,j} a_i b_j x^{i+j} = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{n+m} c_k x^k = C(x).\n    \t$$\n\n    \tThe sequence $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n+m}$ of the coefficients of $C(x)$ is called the **convolution** of $a_0, \\dots, a_n$ and $b_0, \\dots, b_m$.\n\n    !!! info \"Definition\"\n    \tThe **degree** of a polynomial $A$ with $a_n \\neq 0$ is defined as $\\deg A = n$.\n\t\n    \tFor consistency, degree of $A(x) = 0$ is defined as $\\deg A = -\\infty$.\n\n    In this notion, $\\deg AB = \\deg A + \\deg B$ for any polynomials $A$ and $B$.\n\n    Convolutions are the basis of solving many enumerative problems.\n\n    !!! Example\n    \tYou have $n$ objects of the first kind and $m$ objects of the second kind.\n\n    \tObjects of first kind are valued $a_1, \\dots, a_n$, and objects of the second kind are valued $b_1, \\dots, b_m$.\n\n    \tYou pick a single object of the first kind and a single object of the second kind. How many ways are there to get the total value $k$?\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n    \tConsider the product $(x^{a_1} + \\dots + x^{a_n})(x^{b_1} + \\dots + x^{b_m})$. If you expand it, each monomial will correspond to the pair $(a_i, b_j)$ and contribute to the coefficient near $x^{a_i+b_j}$. In other words, the answer is the coefficient near $x^k$ in the product.\n\n    !!! Example\n    \tYou throw a $6$-sided die $n$ times and sum up the results from all throws. What is the probability of getting sum of $k$?\n\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n    \tThe answer is the number of outcomes having the sum $k$, divided by the total number of outcomes, which is $6^n$.\n\n    \tWhat is the number of outcomes having the sum $k$? For $n=1$, it may be represented by a polynomial $A(x) = x^1+x^2+\\dots+x^6$.\n\n    \tFor $n=2$, using the same approach as in the example above, we conclude that it is represented by the polynomial $(x^1+x^2+\\dots+x^6)^2$.\n\n    \tThat being said, the answer to the problem is the $k$-th coefficient of $(x^1+x^2+\\dots+x^6)^n$, divided by $6^n$.\n\n    The coefficient near $x^k$ in the polynomial $A(x)$ is denoted shortly as $[x^k]A$.\n\n    ### Formal power series\n\n    !!! info \"Definition\"\n    \tA **formal power series** is an infinite sum $A(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\dots$, considered regardless of its convergence properties.\n\n    In other words, when we consider e.g. a sum $1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\dots=2$, we imply that it _converges_ to $2$ when the number of summands approach infinity. However, formal series are only considered in terms of sequences that make them.\n\n    !!! info \"Definition\"\n    \tThe **product** of formal power series $A(x)$ and $B(x)$, is also defined by expanding it as an arithmetic expression:\n\n\n    \t$$\n    \tA(x) B(x) = \\left(\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^\\infty a_i x^i \\right)\\left(\\sum\\limits_{j=0}^\\infty b_j x^j\\right) = \\sum\\limits_{i,j} a_i b_j x^{i+j} = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{\\infty} c_k x^k = C(x),\n    \t$$\n\n    \twhere the coefficients $c_0, c_1, \\dots$ are define as finite sums\n\n    \t$$\n    \tc_k = \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^k a_i b_{k-i}.\n    \t$$\n\n    \tThe sequence $c_0, c_1, \\dots$ is also called a **convolution** of $a_0, a_1, \\dots$ and $b_0, b_1, \\dots$, generalizing the concept to infinite sequences.\n\n    Thus, polynomials may be considered formal power series, but with finite number of coefficients.\n\n    Formal power series play a crucial role in enumerative combinatorics, where they're studied as [generating functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_function) for various sequences. Detailed explanation of generating functions and the intuition behind them will, unfortunately, be out of scope for this article, therefore the curious reader is referenced e.g. [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/103979) for details about their combinatorial meaning.\n\n    However, we will very briefly mention that if $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ are generating functions for sequences that enumerate some objects by number of \"atoms\" in them (e.g. trees by the number of vertices), then the product $A(x) B(x)$ enumerates objects that can be described as pairs of objects of kinds $A$ and $B$, enumerates by the total number of \"atoms\" in the pair.\n\n    !!! Example\n    \tLet $A(x) = \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^\\infty 2^i x^i$ enumerate packs of stones, each stone colored in one of $2$ colors (so, there are $2^i$ such packs of size $i$) and $B(x) = \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{\\infty} 3^j x^j$ enumerate packs of stones, each stone colored in one of $3$ colors. Then $C(x) = A(x) B(x) = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^\\infty c_k x^k$ would enumerate objects that may be described as \"two packs of stones, first pack only of stones of type $A$, second pack only of stones of type $B$, with total number of stones being $k$\" for $c_k$.\n\n    In a similar way, there is an intuitive meaning to some other functions over formal power series.\n\n    ### Long polynomial division\n\n    Similar to integers, it is possible to define long division on polynomials.\n\n    !!! info \"Definition\"\n\n    \tFor any polynomials $A$ and $B \\neq 0$, one may represent $A$ as\n\n    \t$$\n    \tA = D \\cdot B + R,~ \\deg R < \\deg B,\n    \t$$\n\n    \twhere $R$ is called the **remainder** of $A$ modulo $B$ and $D$ is called the **quotient**.\n\n    Denoting $\\deg A = n$ and $\\deg B = m$, naive way to do it is to use long division, during which you multiply $B$ by the monomial $\\frac{a_n}{b_m} x^{n - m}$ and subtract it from $A$, until the degree of $A$ is smaller than that of $B$. What remains of $A$ in the end will be the remainder (hence the name), and the polynomials with which you multiplied $B$ in the process, summed together, form the quotient.\n\n    !!! info \"Definition\"\n    \tIf $A$ and $B$ have the same remainder modulo $C$, they're said to be **equivalent** modulo $C$, which is denoted as\n\t\n    \t$$\n    \tA \\equiv B \\pmod{C}.\n    \t$$\n\t\n    Polynomial long division is useful because of its many important properties:\n\n    - $A$ is a multiple of $B$ if and only if $A \\equiv 0 \\pmod B$.\n\n    - It implies that $A \\equiv B \\pmod C$ if and only if $A-B$ is a multiple of $C$.\n\n    - In particular, $A \\equiv B \\pmod{C \\cdot D}$ implies $A \\equiv B \\pmod{C}$.\n\n    - For any linear polynomial $x-r$ it holds that $A(x) \\equiv A(r) \\pmod{x-r}$.\n\n    - It implies that $A$ is a multiple of $x-r$ if and only if $A(r)=0$.\n\n    - For modulo being $x^k$, it holds that $A \\equiv a_0 + a_1 x + \\dots + a_{k-1} x^{k-1} \\pmod{x^k}$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Basic Geometry\n    Part: 2/3\n    ```\n\n    To see the next important property we should take a look at the set of points $\\mathbf r$ for which $\\mathbf r\\cdot \\mathbf a = C$ for some fixed constant $C$.\n    You can see that this set of points is exactly the set of points for which the projection onto $\\mathbf a$ is the point $C \\cdot \\dfrac{\\mathbf a}{|\\mathbf a|}$ and they form a hyperplane orthogonal to $\\mathbf a$.\n    You can see the vector $\\mathbf a$ alongside with several such vectors having same dot product with it in 2D on the picture below:\n\n    <center>![Vectors having same dot product with a](https://i.imgur.com/eyO7St4.png)</center>\n\n    In 2D these vectors will form a line, in 3D they will form a plane.\n    Note that this result allows us to define a line in 2D as $\\mathbf r\\cdot \\mathbf n=C$ or $(\\mathbf r - \\mathbf r_0)\\cdot \\mathbf n=0$ where $\\mathbf n$ is vector orthogonal to the line and $\\mathbf r_0$ is any vector already present on the line and $C = \\mathbf r_0\\cdot \\mathbf n$.\n    In the same manner a plane can be defined in 3D.\n\n    ## Cross product\n\n    ### Definition\n\n    Assume you have three vectors $\\mathbf a$, $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ in 3D space joined in a parallelepiped as in the picture below:\n    <center>![Three vectors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Parallelepiped_volume.svg/240px-Parallelepiped_volume.svg.png)</center>\n\n    How would you calculate its volume?\n    From school we know that we should multiply the area of the base with the height, which is projection of $\\mathbf a$ onto direction orthogonal to base.\n    That means that if we define $\\mathbf b \\times \\mathbf c$ as the vector which is orthogonal to both $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ and which length is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ then $|\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times\\mathbf c)|$ will be equal to the volume of the parallelepiped.\n    For integrity we will say that $\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ will be always directed in such way that the rotation from the vector $\\mathbf b$ to the vector $\\mathbf c$ from the point of $\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ is always counter-clockwise (see the picture below).\n\n    <center>![cross product](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Cross_product_vector.svg/250px-Cross_product_vector.svg.png)</center>\n\n    This defines the cross (or vector) product $\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ of the vectors $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ and the triple product $\\mathbf a\\cdot(\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c)$ of the vectors $\\mathbf a$, $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$.\n\n    Some notable properties of cross and triple products:\n\n    1.  $\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b = -\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf a$\n    2.  $(\\alpha \\cdot \\mathbf a)\\times \\mathbf b = \\alpha \\cdot (\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b)$\n    3.  For any $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ there is exactly one vector $\\mathbf r$ such that $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf a\\cdot\\mathbf r$ for any vector $\\mathbf a$. <br>Indeed if there are two such vectors $\\mathbf r_1$ and $\\mathbf r_2$ then $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf r_1 - \\mathbf r_2)=0$ for all vectors $\\mathbf a$ which is possible only when $\\mathbf r_1 = \\mathbf r_2$.\n    4.  $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf b\\cdot (\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf a) = -\\mathbf a\\cdot( \\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf b)$\n    5.  $(\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c = \\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$.\n        Indeed for all vectors $\\mathbf r$ the chain of equations holds:\n\n        \\[\\mathbf r\\cdot( (\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c) = (\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b) \\cdot (\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) =  \\mathbf a \\cdot(\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) + \\mathbf b\\cdot(\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) = \\mathbf r\\cdot (\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c) + \\mathbf r\\cdot(\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf r\\cdot(\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c)\\]\n\n        Which proves $(\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c = \\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ due to point 3.\n\n    6.  $|\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b|=|\\mathbf a| \\cdot |\\mathbf b| \\sin \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is angle between $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$, since $|\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b|$ equals to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$. \n\n    Given all this and that the following equation holds for the unit vectors\n\n    $$\\mathbf e_x\\times \\mathbf e_x = \\mathbf e_y\\times \\mathbf e_y = \\mathbf e_z\\times \\mathbf e_z = \\mathbf 0,\\\\\n    \\mathbf e_x\\times \\mathbf e_y = \\mathbf e_z,~\\mathbf e_y\\times \\mathbf e_z = \\mathbf e_x,~\\mathbf e_z\\times \\mathbf e_x = \\mathbf e_y$$\n\n    we can calculate the cross product of $\\mathbf a = (x_1;y_1;z_1)$ and $\\mathbf b = (x_2;y_2;z_2)$ in coordinate form:\n\n    $$\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b = (x_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_x + y_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_y + z_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_z)\\times (x_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_x + y_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_y + z_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_z) =$$\n\n    $$(y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2)\\mathbf e_x  + (z_1 x_2 - x_1 z_2)\\mathbf e_y + (x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2)$$\n\n    Which also can be written in the more elegant form:\n\n    $$\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b = \\begin{vmatrix}\\mathbf e_x & \\mathbf e_y & \\mathbf e_z \\\\ x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\end{vmatrix},~a\\cdot(b\\times c) = \\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & z_3 \\end{vmatrix}$$\n\n    Here $| \\cdot |$ stands for the determinant of a matrix. \n\n    Some kind of cross product (namely the pseudo-scalar product) can also be implemented in the 2D case.\n    If we would like to calculate the area of parallelogram formed by vectors $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$ we would compute $|\\mathbf e_z\\cdot(\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b)| = |x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2|$.\n    Another way to obtain the same result is to multiply $|\\mathbf a|$ (base of parallelogram) with the height, which is the projection of vector $\\mathbf b$ onto vector $\\mathbf a$ rotated by $90^\\circ$ which in turn is $\\widehat{\\mathbf a}=(-y_1;x_1)$.\n    That is, to calculate $|\\widehat{\\mathbf a}\\cdot\\mathbf b|=|x_1y_2 - y_1 x_2|$. \n\n    If we will take the sign into consideration then the area will be positive if the rotation from $\\mathbf a$ to $\\mathbf b$ (i.e. from the view of the point of $\\mathbf e_z$) is performed counter-clockwise and negative otherwise.\n    That defines the pseudo-scalar product.\n    Note that it also equals $|\\mathbf a| \\cdot |\\mathbf b| \\sin \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is angle from $\\mathbf a$ to $\\mathbf b$ count counter-clockwise (and negative if rotation is clockwise).\n\n    Let's implement all this stuff!\n\n    ```{.cpp file=crossproduct}\n    point3d cross(point3d a, point3d b) {\n        return point3d(a.y * b.z - a.z * b.y,\n                       a.z * b.x - a.x * b.z,\n                       a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x);\n    }\n    ftype triple(point3d a, point3d b, point3d c) {\n        return dot(a, cross(b, c));\n    }\n    ftype cross(point2d a, point2d b) {\n        return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
