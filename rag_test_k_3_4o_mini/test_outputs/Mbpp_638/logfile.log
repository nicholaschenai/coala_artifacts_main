INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/638 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the wind chill index based on two inputs: wind velocity in kilometers per hour and temperature in degrees Celsius. The result should be rounded up to the nearest integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The wind chill index can be calculated using a specific formula that takes into account both the wind speed and the temperature. After calculating the wind chill value, we will round it up to the next integer to get the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `wind_chill` that takes two parameters: `velocity` (wind speed in km/h) and `temperature` (temperature in Celsius).
   - Use the wind chill formula: 
     \[
     WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215 \times T - 11.37 \times V^{0.16} + 0.3965 \times T \times V^{0.16}
     \]
     where \( WCI \) is the wind chill index, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( V \) is the wind speed.
   - Round the result of the calculation up to the nearest integer.
   - Return the rounded value.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
import math

def calculate_wind_chill(velocity, temperature):
    # Calculate the wind chill index using the formula
    wind_chill_index = (13.12 + 
                        0.6215 * temperature - 
                        11.37 * (velocity ** 0.16) + 
                        0.3965 * temperature * (velocity ** 0.16))
    
    # Round up to the next integer
    return math.ceil(wind_chill_index)

def wind_chill(velocity: int, temperature: int) -> int:
    # Call the helper function to calculate wind chill
    return calculate_wind_chill(velocity, temperature)

        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m 
            def mod_min(r, n, m):

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/638 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the wind chill index using the provided formula and return the result rounded up to the nearest integer. The assertion states that for a wind velocity of 120 km/h and a temperature of 35°C, the expected output is 40.

2. **Reviewing the Formula**: The formula used in the code is:
   \[
   WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215T - 11.37V^{0.16} + 0.3965TV^{0.16}
   \]
   This formula is correct for calculating the wind chill index.

3. **Identifying the Issue**: The output of the function for the inputs (120, 35) is 41, which is not equal to the expected output of 40. This indicates that the rounding method or the calculation itself might be incorrect.

4. **Rounding Method**: The code uses `math.ceil()` to round the result. However, the problem states that we need to round to the next integer. If the result is already an integer, `math.ceil()` will not change it, but if it is a decimal, it will round it up. This could lead to discrepancies if the expected output is not aligned with the rounding method used.

5. **Revisiting the Calculation**: I need to ensure that the calculation is performed correctly and that the rounding method aligns with the expected output. 

6. **Adjusting the Rounding**: Instead of using `math.ceil()`, I should consider using the built-in `round()` function, which rounds to the nearest integer. However, since the problem specifies rounding to the next integer, I will need to adjust the logic to ensure that if the result is not an integer, it rounds up.

Now, I will revise the code to ensure it meets the requirements correctly. 

Here’s the updated plan:
- Calculate the wind chill index using the formula.
- Use a custom rounding method to ensure that we always round up if there is any decimal part.

Let's implement this in the code. 

```python
# Function to calculate the wind chill index
def wind_chill(velocity: int, temperature: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the wind chill index using the formula
    WCI = 13.12 + (0.6215 * temperature) - (11.37 * (velocity ** 0.16)) + (0.3965 * temperature * (velocity ** 0.16))
    
    # Round up the result to the next integer
    if WCI == int(WCI):
        return int(WCI)  # If it's already an integer, return it as is
    else:
        return int(WCI) + 1  # Otherwise, round up

        You're given integer numbers $A$, $B$ and $N$. Find $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$ such that $Ax + By \leq N$ and $Ax + By$ is the maximum possible.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        In this problem it holds that $1 \leq A, B, N \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$, so it can be solved in $O(\sqrt N)$. However, there is $O(\log N)$ solution with continued fractions.

        For our convenience, we will invert the direction of $x$ by doing a substitution $x \mapsto \lfloor \frac{N}{A}\rfloor - x$, so that now we need to find the point $(x; y)$ such that $0 \leq x \leq \lfloor \frac{N}{A} \rfloor$, $By - Ax \leq N \;\bmod\; A$ and $By - Ax$ is the maximum possible. Optimal $y$ for each $x$ has a value of $\lfloor \frac{Ax + (N \bmod A)}{B} \rfloor$.

        To treat it more generically, we will write a function that finds the best point on $0 \leq x \leq N$ and $y = \lfloor \frac{Ax+B}{C} \rfloor$.

        Core solution idea in this problem essentially repeats the previous problem, but instead of using lower semiconvergents to diverge from line, you use upper semiconvergents to get closer to the line without crossing it and without violating $x \leq N$. Unfortunately, unlike the previous problem, you need to make sure that you don't cross the $y=\frac{Ax+B}{C}$ line while getting closer to it, so you should keep it in mind when calculating semiconvergent's coefficient $t$.

        This problem reduces to the previous one if you note that $a \bmod b = a - \lfloor \frac{a}{b} \rfloor b$. With this fact, the sum reduces to

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m

                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

   The wind chill index can be calculated using a specific formula that takes into account both the wind speed and the temperature. The formula is:
   \[
   WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215T - 11.37V^{0.16} + 0.3965TV^{0.16}
   \]
   where \( WCI \) is the wind chill index, \( T \) is the temperature in Celsius, and \( V \) is the wind speed in km/h. After calculating the wind chill index using this formula, we will round the result up to the nearest integer.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION wind_chill(velocity, temperature):
       # Calculate the wind chill index using the formula
       WCI = 13.12 + (0.6215 * temperature) - (11.37 * (velocity ** 0.16)) + (0.3965 * temperature * (velocity ** 0.16))
       # Round up the result to the next integer
       RETURN ceil(WCI)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
import math

# Function to calculate the wind chill index
def wind_chill(velocity: int, temperature: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the wind chill index using the formula
    WCI = 13.12 + (0.6215 * temperature) - (11.37 * (velocity ** 0.16)) + (0.3965 * temperature * (velocity ** 0.16))
    # Round up the result to the next integer
    return math.ceil(WCI)

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/638 [prompt] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the wind chill index using the provided formula and return the result rounded up to the nearest integer. The assertion states that for a wind velocity of 120 km/h and a temperature of 35°C, the expected output is 40.

2. **Reviewing the Formula**: The formula used in the code is:
   \[
   WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215T - 11.37V^{0.16} + 0.3965TV^{0.16}
   \]
   This formula is correct for calculating the wind chill index.

3. **Identifying the Issue**: The output of the function for the inputs (120, 35) is 41, which is not equal to the expected output of 40. This indicates that the rounding method or the calculation itself might be incorrect.

4. **Rounding Method**: The code uses `math.ceil()` to round the result. However, the problem states that we need to round to the next integer. If the result is already an integer, `math.ceil()` will not change it, but if it is a decimal, it will round it up. This could lead to discrepancies if the expected output is not aligned with the rounding method used.

5. **Revisiting the Calculation**: I need to ensure that the calculation is performed correctly and that the rounding method aligns with the expected output. 

6. **Adjusting the Rounding**: Instead of using `math.ceil()`, I should consider using the built-in `round()` function, which rounds to the nearest integer. However, since the problem specifies rounding to the next integer, I will need to adjust the logic to ensure that if the result is not an integer, it rounds up.

Now, I will revise the code to ensure it meets the requirements correctly. 

Here’s the updated plan:
- Calculate the wind chill index using the formula.
- Use a custom rounding method to ensure that we always round up if there is any decimal part.

Let's implement this in the code. 

```python
# Function to calculate the wind chill index
def wind_chill(velocity: int, temperature: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the wind chill index using the formula
    WCI = 13.12 + (0.6215 * temperature) - (11.37 * (velocity ** 0.16)) + (0.3965 * temperature * (velocity ** 0.16))
    
    # Round up the result to the next integer
    if WCI == int(WCI):
        return int(WCI)  # If it's already an integer, return it as is
    else:
        return int(WCI) + 1  # Otherwise, round up

        Given $N$, $M$, $A$ and $B$, compute $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{N-1} \lfloor \frac{A \cdot i + B}{M} \rfloor$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        You're given integer numbers $A$, $B$ and $N$. Find $x \geq 0$ and $y \geq 0$ such that $Ax + By \leq N$ and $Ax + By$ is the maximum possible.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        In this problem it holds that $1 \leq A, B, N \leq 2 \cdot 10^9$, so it can be solved in $O(\sqrt N)$. However, there is $O(\log N)$ solution with continued fractions.

        For our convenience, we will invert the direction of $x$ by doing a substitution $x \mapsto \lfloor \frac{N}{A}\rfloor - x$, so that now we need to find the point $(x; y)$ such that $0 \leq x \leq \lfloor \frac{N}{A} \rfloor$, $By - Ax \leq N \;\bmod\; A$ and $By - Ax$ is the maximum possible. Optimal $y$ for each $x$ has a value of $\lfloor \frac{Ax + (N \bmod A)}{B} \rfloor$.

        To treat it more generically, we will write a function that finds the best point on $0 \leq x \leq N$ and $y = \lfloor \frac{Ax+B}{C} \rfloor$.

        Core solution idea in this problem essentially repeats the previous problem, but instead of using lower semiconvergents to diverge from line, you use upper semiconvergents to get closer to the line without crossing it and without violating $x \leq N$. Unfortunately, unlike the previous problem, you need to make sure that you don't cross the $y=\frac{Ax+B}{C}$ line while getting closer to it, so you should keep it in mind when calculating semiconvergent's coefficient $t$.
