    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes an integer as input and sets all even bits of that integer to 1. The function should return the modified integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To set all even bits of a number, we can create a mask that has 1s in all even positions (0, 2, 4, ...) and 0s in all odd positions (1, 3, 5, ...). We can then use the bitwise OR operation to combine this mask with the original number, which will set the even bits to 1 while leaving the odd bits unchanged.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `even_bit_set_number` that takes an integer `n`.\n   - Create a mask with 1s in all even positions. This can be done by initializing a variable `mask` to 0 and then using a loop to set the even bits.\n   - Use the bitwise OR operation between `n` and `mask` to set the even bits of `n`.\n   - Return the modified number.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n\n```python\ndef create_even_bit_mask():\n    # Initialize mask to 0\n    mask = 0\n    # Set bits at even positions (0, 2, 4, ...)\n    for i in range(32):  # Assuming we are working with a 32-bit integer\n        if i % 2 == 0:  # Check if the position is even\n            mask |= (1 << i)  # Set the i-th bit in the mask\n    return mask\n\ndef even_bit_set_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Create a mask with all even bits set to 1\n    mask = create_even_bit_mask()\n    # Set the even bits of n using bitwise OR\n    return n | mask\n```",
