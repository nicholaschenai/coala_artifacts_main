INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/130 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of items and returns the item that appears most frequently in that list. If there are multiple items with the same maximum frequency, we will return the first one that reaches that frequency.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each item in the list. We will iterate through the list, updating the count for each item in the dictionary. After counting, we will determine which item has the highest count and return that item.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_occurrences(input_list):
       create an empty dictionary to store counts
       for each item in input_list:
           if item is not in dictionary:
               add item to dictionary with count 1
           else:
               increment the count of item in dictionary
       
       initialize max_count to 0 and max_item to None
       for each item and count in dictionary:
           if count is greater than max_count:
               update max_count to count
               update max_item to item
       
       return max_item

    Section: Maximum subarray sum
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Maximum subarray sum}

    \index{maximum subarray sum}

    There are often several possible algorithms
    for solving a problem such that their
    time complexities are different.
    This section discusses a classic problem that
    has a straightforward $O(n^3)$ solution.
    However, by designing a better algorithm, it
    is possible to solve the problem in $O(n^2)$
    time and even in $O(n)$ time.

    Given an array of $n$ numbers,
    our task is to calculate the
    \key{maximum subarray sum}, i.e.,
    the largest possible sum of 
    a sequence of consecutive values
    in the array\footnote{J. Bentley's
    book \emph{Programming Pearls} \cite{ben86} made the problem popular.}.
    The problem is interesting when there may be
    negative values in the array.
    For example, in the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{samepage}
    the following subarray produces the maximum sum $10$:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (6,1);
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \end{samepage}

    We assume that an empty subarray is allowed,
    so the maximum subarray sum is always at least $0$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    A straightforward way to solve the problem
    is to go through all possible subarrays,
    calculate the sum of values in each subarray and maintain
    the maximum sum.
    The following code implements this algorithm:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int k = a; k <= b; k++) {
                sum += array[k];
            }
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The variables \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} fix the first and
    last index of the subarray,
    and the sum of values is calculated to the variable \texttt{sum}.
    The variable \texttt{best} contains the maximum sum found during the search.

    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^3)$,
    because it consists of three nested loops 
    that go through the input.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is easy to make Algorithm 1 more efficient
    by removing one loop from it.
    This is possible by calculating the sum at the same
    time when the right end of the subarray moves.
    The result is the following code:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            sum += array[b];
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this change, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Surprisingly, it is possible to solve the problem
    in $O(n)$ time\footnote{In \cite{ben86}, this linear-time algorithm
    is attributed to J. B. Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes
    called \index{Kadane's algorithm} \key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means
    that just one loop is enough.
    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,
    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.
    After this, the answer for the problem is the
    maximum of those sums.

    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray
    that ends at position $k$.
    There are two possibilities:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.
    \item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends
    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.
    \end{enumerate}

    In the latter case, since we want to
    find a subarray with maximum sum,
    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$
    should also have the maximum sum.
    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently
    by calculating the maximum subarray sum
    for each ending position from left to right.

    The following code implements the algorithm:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0, sum = 0;
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);
        best = max(best,sum);
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The algorithm only contains one loop
    that goes through the input,
    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.
    This is also the best possible time complexity,
    because any algorithm for the problem
    has to examine all array elements at least once.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    It is interesting to study how efficient 
    algorithms are in practice.
    The following table shows the running times
    of the above algorithms for different
    values of $n$ on a modern computer.

    In each test, the input was generated randomly.
    The time needed for reading the input was not
    measured.

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    array size $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^2$ & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^3$ & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^4$ & > $10.0$ s & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^5$ & > $10.0$ s & $5.3$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^6$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^7$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    The comparison shows that all algorithms
    are efficient when the input size is small,
    but larger inputs bring out remarkable
    differences in the running times of the algorithms.
    Algorithm 1 becomes slow
    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2
    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.
    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process
    even the largest inputs instantly.

    \section{Longest increasing subsequence}

    \index{longest increasing subsequence}

    Our first problem is to find the
    \key{longest increasing subsequence}
    in an array of $n$ elements.
    This is a maximum-length
    sequence of array elements
    that goes from left to right,
    and each element in the sequence is larger
    than the previous element.
    For example, in the array

    \end{center}

    Let $\texttt{length}(k)$ denote
    the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position $k$.
    Thus, if we calculate all values of
    $\texttt{length}(k)$ where $0 \le k \le n-1$,
    we will find out the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence.
    For example, the values of the function
    for the above array are as follows:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{length}(0) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(4) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{length}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(6) & = & 4 \\
    \texttt{length}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{length}(6)=4$,
    because the longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position 6 consists of 4 elements.

    To calculate a value of $\texttt{length}(k)$,
    we should find a position $i<k$
    for which $\texttt{array}[i]<\texttt{array}[k]$
    and $\texttt{length}(i)$ is as large as possible.
    Then we know that
    $\texttt{length}(k)=\texttt{length}(i)+1$,
    because this is an optimal way to add
    $\texttt{array}[k]$ to a subsequence.
    However, if there is no such position $i$,
    then $\texttt{length}(k)=1$,
    which means that the subsequence only contains
    $\texttt{array}[k]$.

    Since all values of the function can be calculated
    from its smaller values,
    we can use dynamic programming.
    In the following code, the values
    of the function will be stored in an array
    $\texttt{length}$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        length[k] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (array[i] < array[k]) {
                length[k] = max(length[k],length[i]+1);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    This code works in $O(n^2)$ time,
    because it consists of two nested loops.
    However, it is also possible to implement
    the dynamic programming calculation
    more efficiently in $O(n \log n)$ time.
    Can you find a way to do this?

    Title: Longest increasing subsequence
    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/130 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of items and identifies which item appears most frequently. If there are multiple items with the same maximum frequency, the function should return the first one that reaches that frequency.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each item in the list. We will iterate through the list, updating the count for each item. After counting, we will determine which item has the highest count and return that item.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function max_occurrences(input_list):
       create an empty dictionary to store counts
       for each item in input_list:
           if item is not in dictionary:
               set count to 1
           else:
               increment count by 1
       initialize max_count to 0 and max_item to None
       for each item, count in dictionary:
           if count > max_count:
               update max_count and max_item
       return max_item
