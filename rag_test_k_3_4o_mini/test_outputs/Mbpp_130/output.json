    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of items and identifies which item appears most frequently. If there are multiple items with the same maximum frequency, the function should return the first one that reaches that frequency.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each item in the list. We will iterate through the list, updating the count for each item. After counting, we will determine which item has the highest count and return that item.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_occurrences(input_list):\n       create an empty dictionary to store counts\n       for each item in input_list:\n           if item is not in dictionary:\n               set count to 1\n           else:\n               increment count by 1\n       initialize max_count to 0 and max_item to None\n       for each item, count in dictionary:\n           if count > max_count:\n               update max_count and max_item\n       return max_item\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_occurrences(input_list):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each item\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count the occurrences of each item in the input list\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item in count_dict:\n            count_dict[item] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[item] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the item with the maximum count\n    max_count = 0\n    max_item = None\n    \n    # Find the item with the maximum frequency\n    for item, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count > max_count:\n            max_count = count\n            max_item = item\n    \n    # Return the item with the maximum frequency\n    return max_item\n```",
