    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that counts how many times a specific number appears in a given list of numbers. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 3]` and the number to count is `4`, the function should return `0` because `4` does not appear in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and maintain a count of how many times the specified number appears. We will initialize a counter to zero and increment it each time we find a match. Finally, we will return the counter.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function frequency(numbers, target):\n       count = 0\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is equal to target:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(numbers, target):\n    # Initialize a counter to zero\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is equal to the target\n        if number == target:\n            # Increment the count if there's a match\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n\n# The function name must be 'frequency' as specified\ndef frequency(numbers, target):\n    return count_occurrences(numbers, target)\n```",
