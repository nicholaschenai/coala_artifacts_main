INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/748 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and adds spaces between words that start with capital letters. For example, if the input is "HelloWorld", the output should be "Hello World".

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We can iterate through each character in the string. Whenever we encounter a capital letter (except for the first character), we will insert a space before it. This way, we can separate the words that start with capital letters.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Initialize an empty result string.
   - Loop through each character in the input string.
   - If the character is uppercase and it is not the first character, append a space to the result string before appending the character.
   - If it is the first character or not uppercase, just append the character to the result string.
   - Return the result string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def capital_words_spaces(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty result string
    result = ""
    
    # Loop through each character in the input string
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # If the character is uppercase and it's not the first character
        if s[i].isupper() and i != 0:
            # Append a space before appending the character
            result += " "
        # Append the character to the result string
        result += s[i]

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    Title: Lyndon factorization
    Part: 1/1
    # Lyndon factorization

    ## Lyndon factorization

    First let us define the notion of the Lyndon factorization.

    A string is called **simple** (or a Lyndon word), if it is strictly **smaller than** any of its own nontrivial **suffixes**.
    Examples of simple strings are: $a$, $b$, $ab$, $aab$, $abb$, $ababb$, $abcd$.
    It can be shown that a string is simple, if and only if it is strictly **smaller than** all its nontrivial **cyclic shifts**.

    Next, let there be a given string $s$.
    The **Lyndon factorization** of the string $s$ is a factorization $s = w_1 w_2 \dots w_k$, where all strings $w_i$ are simple, and they are in non-increasing order $w_1 \ge w_2 \ge \dots \ge w_k$.

    It can be shown, that for any string such a factorization exists and that it is unique.

    ## Duval algorithm

    The Duval algorithm constructs the Lyndon factorization in $O(n)$ time using $O(1)$ additional memory.

    First let us introduce another notion:
    a string $t$ is called **pre-simple**, if it has the form $t = w w \dots w \overline{w}$, where $w$ is a simple string and $\overline{w}$ is a prefix of $w$ (possibly empty).
    A simple string is also pre-simple.

    The Duval algorithm is greedy.
    At any point during its execution, the string $s$ will actually be divided into three strings $s = s_1 s_2 s_3$, where the Lyndon factorization for $s_1$ is already found and finalized, the string $s_2$ is pre-simple (and we know the length of the simple string in it), and $s_3$ is completely untouched.
    In each iteration the Duval algorithm takes the first character of the string $s_3$ and tries to append it to the string $s_2$.
    It $s_2$ is no longer pre-simple, then the Lyndon factorization for some part of $s_2$ becomes known, and this part goes to $s_1$.

    Let's describe the algorithm in more detail.
    The pointer $i$ will always point to the beginning of the string $s_2$.
    The outer loop will be executed as long as $i < n$.
    Inside the loop we use two additional pointers, $j$ which points to the beginning of $s_3$, and $k$ which points to the current character that we are currently comparing to.
    We want to add the character $s[j]$ to the string $s_2$, which requires a comparison with the character $s[k]$.
    There can be three different cases:

    - $s[j] = s[k]$: if this is the case, then adding the symbol $s[j]$ to $s_2$ doesn't violate its pre-simplicity.
      So we simply increment the pointers $j$ and $k$.
    - $s[j] > s[k]$: here, the string $s_2 + s[j]$ becomes simple.
      We can increment $j$ and reset $k$ back to the beginning of $s_2$, so that the next character can be compared with the beginning of the simple word.
    - $s[j] < s[k]$: the string $s_2 + s[j]$ is no longer pre-simple.
      Therefore we will split the pre-simple string $s_2$ into its simple strings and the remainder, possibly empty.
      The simple string will have the length $j - k$.
      In the next iteration we start again with the remaining $s_2$.

    ### Implementation

    Here we present the implementation of the Duval algorithm, which will return the desired Lyndon factorization of a given string $s$.

    ```{.cpp file=duval_algorithm}
    vector<string> duval(string const& s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int i = 0;
        vector<string> factorization;
        while (i < n) {
            int j = i + 1, k = i;
            while (j < n && s[k] <= s[j]) {
                if (s[k] < s[j])
                    k = i;
                else
                    k++;
                j++;
            }
            while (i <= k) {
                factorization.push_back(s.substr(i, j - k));
                i += j - k;
            }
        }
        return factorization;
    }
    ```

    ### Complexity

    Let us estimate the running time of this algorithm.

    The **outer while loop** does not exceed $n$ iterations, since at the end of each iteration $i$ increases.
    Also the second inner while loop runs in $O(n)$, since is only outputs the final factorization.

    So we are only interested in the **first inner while loop**.
    How many iterations does it perform in the worst case?
    It's easy to see that the simple words that we identify in each iteration of the outer loop are longer than the remainder that we additionally compared.
    Therefore also the sum of the remainders will be smaller than $n$, which means that we only perform at most $O(n)$ iterations of the first inner while loop.
    In fact the total number of character comparisons will not exceed $4n - 3$.

    ## Finding the smallest cyclic shift

    Let there be a string $s$.
    We construct the Lyndon factorization for the string $s + s$ (in $O(n)$ time).
    We will look for a simple string in the factorization, which starts at a position less than $n$ (i.e. it starts in the first instance of $s$), and ends in a position greater than or equal to $n$ (i.e. in the second instance) of $s$).
    It is stated, that the position of the start of this simple string will be the beginning of the desired smallest cyclic shift.
    This can be easily verified using the definition of the Lyndon decomposition.

    The beginning of the simple block can be found easily - just remember the pointer $i$ at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop, which indicated the beginning of the current pre-simple string.

    So we get the following implementation:

    ```{.cpp file=smallest_cyclic_string}
    string min_cyclic_string(string s) {
        s += s;
        int n = s.size();
        int i = 0, ans = 0;
        while (i < n / 2) {
            ans = i;
            int j = i + 1, k = i;
            while (j < n && s[k] <= s[j]) {
                if (s[k] < s[j])
                    k = i;
                else
                    k++;
                j++;
            }
            while (i <= k)
                i += j - k;
        }
        return s.substr(ans, n / 2);
    }
    ```

    Title: Aho-Corasick algorithm
    Part: 1/3
    # Aho-Corasick algorithm

    The Aho-Corasick algorithm allows us to quickly search for multiple patterns in a text.
    The set of pattern strings is also called a _dictionary_.
    We will denote the total length of its constituent strings by $m$ and the size of the alphabet by $k$.
    The algorithm constructs a finite state automaton based on a trie in $O(m k)$ time and then uses it to process the text.

    The algorithm was proposed by Alfred Aho and Margaret Corasick in 1975.

    ## Construction of the trie

    <center>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Trie.svg" width="400px">
    <br>
    <i>A trie based on words "Java", "Rad", "Rand", "Rau", "Raum" and "Rose".</i>
    <br>
    <i>The <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Trie.svg">image</a> by [nd](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Nd) is distributed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en">CC BY-SA 3.0</a> license.</i>
    </center>

    Formally, a trie is a rooted tree, where each edge of the tree is labeled with some letter
    and outgoing edges of a vertex have distinct labels.

    We will identify each vertex in the trie with the string formed by the labels on the path from the root to that vertex.

    Each vertex will also have a flag $\text{output}$ which will be set
    if the vertex corresponds to a pattern in the dictionary.

    Accordingly, a trie for a set of strings is a trie such that each $\text{output}$ vertex corresponds to one string from the set, and conversely, each string of the set corresponds to one $\text{output}$ vertex.

    We now describe how to construct a trie for a given set of strings in linear time with respect to their total length.

    We introduce a structure for the vertices of the tree:
    ```{.cpp file=aho_corasick_trie_definition}
    const int K = 26;

    struct Vertex {
        int next[K];
        bool output = false;

        Vertex() {
            fill(begin(next), end(next), -1);
        }
    };

    vector<Vertex> trie(1);
    ```

    Here, we store the trie as an array of $\text{Vertex}$.
    Each $\text{Vertex}$ contains the flag $\text{output}$ and the edges in the form of an array $\text{next}[]$, where $\text{next}[i]$ is the index of the vertex that we reach by following the character $i$, or $-1$ if there is no such edge.
    Initially, the trie consists of only one vertex - the root - with the index $0$.

    Now we implement a function that will add a string $s$ to the trie.
    The implementation is simple:
    we start at the root node, and as long as there are edges corresponding to the characters of $s$ we follow them.
    If there is no edge for one character, we generate a new vertex and connect it with an edge.
    At the end of the process we mark the last vertex with the flag $\text{output}$.

    ```{.cpp file=aho_corasick_trie_add}
    void add_string(string const& s) {
        int v = 0;
        for (char ch : s) {
            int c = ch - 'a';

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/748 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and adds spaces between words that start with capital letters. If the input string consists of a single capitalized word, it should return the word unchanged.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string. Whenever we encounter a capital letter (except for the first character), we will insert a space before it. This way, we can separate the words that start with capital letters. Finally, we will join the characters back into a single string and return the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function capital_words_spaces(input_string):
       if input_string is empty:
           return empty string
       initialize an empty list to hold characters
       for each character in input_string:
           if character is uppercase and it is not the first character:
               append a space to the list
           append the character to the list
       join the list into a string
       return the resulting string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def capital_words_spaces(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Check if the input string is empty
    if not input_string:
        return ""
    
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the characters
    result = []

            result.append(' ')
        # Append the current character to the result list
        result.append(char)
    
    # Join the list into a single string and return it
