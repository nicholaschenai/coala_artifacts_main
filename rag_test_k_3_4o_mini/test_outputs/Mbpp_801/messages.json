It is easy to see that we either have no solutions or infinitely many solutions, depending on whether $c = 0$ or not. In the rest of this article, we will ignore this case.\n\n    ## Analytic solution\n\n    When $a \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 0$, the equation $ax+by=c$ can be equivalently treated as either of the following:\n\n    \\begin{gather}\n    ax \\equiv c \\pmod b,\\newline\n    by \\equiv c \\pmod a.\n    \\end{gather}\n\n    Without loss of generality, assume that $b \\neq 0$ and consider the first equation. When $a$ and $b$ are co-prime, the solution to it is given as\n\n    $$x \\equiv ca^{-1} \\pmod b,$$\n\n    where $a^{-1}$ is the [modular inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$ modulo $b$.\n\n    When $a$ and $b$ are not co-prime, values of $ax$ modulo $b$ for all integer $x$ are divisible by $g=\\gcd(a, b)$, so the solution only exists when $c$ is divisible by $g$. In this case, one of solutions can be found by reducing the equation by $g$:\n\n    $$(a/g) x \\equiv (c/g) \\pmod{b/g}.$$\n\n    By the definition of $g$, the numbers $a/g$ and $b/g$ are co-prime, so the solution is given explicitly as\n\n    $$\\begin{cases}\n    x \\equiv (c/g)(a/g)^{-1}\\pmod{b/g},\\\\\n    y = \\frac{c-ax}{b}.\n    \\end{cases}$$\n\n    ## Algorithmic solution\n\n    To find one solution of the Diophantine equation with 2 unknowns, you can use the [Extended Euclidean algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md). First, assume that $a$ and $b$ are non-negative. When we apply Extended Euclidean algorithm for $a$ and $b$, we can find their greatest common divisor $g$ and 2 numbers $x_g$ and $y_g$ such that:\n\n    $$a x_g + b y_g = g$$\n\n    If $c$ is divisible by $g = \\gcd(a, b)$, then the given Diophantine equation has a solution, otherwise it does not have any solution. The proof is straight-forward: a linear combination of two numbers is divisible by their common divisor.\n\n    Now supposed that $c$ is divisible by $g$, then we have:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g} + b \\cdot y_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g} = c$$\n\n    Therefore one of the solutions of the Diophantine equation is:\n\n    $$x_0 = x_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g},$$\n\n    $$y_0 = y_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g}.$$\n\n    The above idea still works when $a$ or $b$ or both of them are negative. We only need to change the sign of $x_0$ and $y_0$ when necessary.\n\n    Finally, we can implement this idea as follows (note that this code does not consider the case $a = b = 0$):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_any}\n    int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {\n        if (b == 0) {\n            x = 1;\n            y = 0;\n            return a;\n        }\n        int x1, y1;\n        int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);\n        x = y1;\n        y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);\n        return d;\n    }\n\n    bool find_any_solution(int a, int b, int c, int &x0, int &y0, int &g) {\n        g = gcd(abs(a), abs(b), x0, y0);\n        if (c % g) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        x0 *= c / g;\n        y0 *= c / g;\n        if (a < 0) x0 = -x0;\n        if (b < 0) y0 = -y0;\n        return true;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Getting all solutions\n\n    From one solution $(x_0, y_0)$, we can obtain all the solutions of the given equation.\n\n    Let $g = \\gcd(a, b)$ and let $x_0, y_0$ be integers which satisfy the following:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot y_0 = c$$\n\n    Now, we should see that adding $b / g$ to $x_0$, and, at the same time subtracting $a / g$ from $y_0$ will not break the equality:\n\n    $$a \\cdot \\left(x_0 + \\frac{b}{g}\\right) + b \\cdot \\left(y_0 - \\frac{a}{g}\\right) = a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot y_0 + a \\cdot \\frac{b}{g} - b \\cdot \\frac{a}{g} = c$$\n\n    Obviously, this process can be repeated again, so all the numbers of the form:\n\n    $$x = x_0 + k \\cdot \\frac{b}{g}$$\n\n    $$y = y_0 - k \\cdot \\frac{a}{g}$$\n\n    are solutions of the given Diophantine equation.\n\n    Moreover, this is the set of all possible solutions of the given Diophantine equation.\n\n    ## Finding the number of solutions and the solutions in a given interval\n\n    From previous section, it should be clear that if we don't impose any restrictions on the solutions, there would be infinite number of them. So in this section, we add some restrictions on the interval of $x$ and $y$, and we will try to count and enumerate all the solutions.\n\n    Let there be two intervals: $[min_x; max_x]$ and $[min_y; max_y]$ and let's say we only want to find the solutions in these two intervals.\n\n    Note that if $a$ or $b$ is $0$, then the problem only has one solution. We don't consider this case here.\n\n    First, we can find a solution which have minimum value of $x$, such that $x \\ge min_x$. To do this, we first find any solution of the Diophantine equation. Then, we shift this solution to get $x \\ge min_x$ (using what we know about the set of all solutions in previous section). This can be done in $O(1)$.\n    Denote this minimum value of $x$ by $l_{x1}$.\n\n    Similarly, we can find the maximum value of $x$ which satisfy $x \\le max_x$. Denote this maximum value of $x$ by $r_{x1}$.\n\n    Similarly, we can find the minimum value of $y$ $(y \\ge min_y)$ and maximum values of $y$ $(y \\le max_y)$. Denote the corresponding values of $x$ by $l_{x2}$ and $r_{x2}$.\n\n    The final solution is all solutions with x in intersection of $[l_{x1}, r_{x1}]$ and $[l_{x2}, r_{x2}]$. Let denote this intersection by $[l_x, r_x]$.\n\n    Following is the code implementing this idea.\n    Notice that we divide $a$ and $b$ at the beginning by $g$.\n    Since the equation $a x + b y = c$ is equivalent to the equation $\\frac{a}{g} x + \\frac{b}{g} y = \\frac{c}{g}$, we can use this one instead and have $\\gcd(\\frac{a}{g}, \\frac{b}{g}) = 1$, which simplifies the formulas.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_all}\n    void shift_solution(int & x, int & y, int a, int b, int cnt) {\n        x += cnt * b;\n        y -= cnt * a;\n    }\n\n    int find_all_solutions(int a, int b, int c, int minx, int maxx, int miny, int maxy) {\n        int x, y, g;\n        if (!find_any_solution(a, b, c, x, y, g))\n            return 0;\n        a /= g;\n        b /= g;\n\n        int sign_a = a > 0 ? +1 : -1;\n        int sign_b = b > 0 ? +1 : -1;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (minx - x) / b);\n        if (x < minx)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_b);\n        if (x > maxx)\n            return 0;\n        int lx1 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (maxx - x) / b);\n        if (x > maxx)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_b);\n        int rx1 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(miny - y) / a);\n        if (y < miny)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_a);\n        if (y > maxy)\n            return 0;\n        int lx2 = x;\n\n        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(maxy - y) / a);\n        if (y > maxy)\n            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_a);\n        int rx2 = x;\n\n        if (lx2 > rx2)\n            swap(lx2, rx2);\n        int lx = max(lx1, lx2);\n        int rx = min(rx1, rx2);\n\n        if (lx > rx)\n            return 0;\n        return (rx - lx) / abs(b) + 1;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n    Part: 3/5\n    ```\n\n    Asymptotics of the solution is $O (\\sqrt{n})$.\n\n    ### The number of integers in a given interval which are multiple of at least one of the given numbers\n\n    Given $n$ numbers $a_i$ and number $r$. You want to count the number of integers in the interval $[1; r]$ that are multiple of at least one of the $a_i$.\n\n    The solution algorithm is almost identical to the one for previous task \u2014 construct the formula of inclusion-exclusion on the numbers $a_i$, i.e. each term in this formula is the number of numbers divisible by a given subset of numbers $a_i$ (in other words, divisible by their [least common multiple](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md)).\n\n    So we will now iterate over all $2^n$ subsets of integers $a_i$ with $O(n \\log r)$ operations to find their least common multiple, adding or subtracting the number of multiples of it in the interval. Asymptotics is $O (2^n\\cdot n\\cdot \\log r)$.\n\n    ### The number of strings that satisfy a given pattern\n\n    Consider $n$ patterns of strings of the same length, consisting only of letters ($a...z$) or question marks. You're also given a number $k$. A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. The task is to count the number of strings that match exactly $k$ of the patterns (first problem) and at least $k$ of the patterns (second problem).\n\n    Notice first that we can easily count the number of strings that satisfy at once all of the specified patterns. To do this, simply \"cross\" patterns: iterate though the positions (\"slots\") and look at a position over all patterns. If all patterns have a question mark in this position, the character can be any letter from $a$ to $z$. Otherwise, the character of this position is uniquely defined by the patterns that do not contain a question mark.\n\n    Learn now to solve the first version of the problem: when the string must satisfy exactly $k$ of the patterns.\n\n    To solve it, iterate and fix a specific subset $X$ from the set of patterns consisting of $k$ patterns. Then we have to count the number of strings that satisfy this set of patterns, and only matches it, that is, they don't match any other pattern. We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a slightly different manner: we sum on all supersets $Y$ (subsets from the original set of strings that contain $X$), and either add to the current answer or subtract it from the number of strings:\n\n    $$ ans(X) = \\sum_{Y \\supseteq X} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \\cdot f(Y) $$\n\n    Where $f(Y)$ is the number of strings that match $Y$ (at least $Y$).\n\n    (If you have a hard time figuring out this, you can try drawing Venn Diagrams.)\n\n    If we sum up on all $ans(X)$, we will get the final answer:\n\n    $$ ans = \\sum_{X ~ : ~ |X| = k} ans(X) $$\n\n    However, asymptotics of this solution is $O(3^k \\cdot k)$. To improve it, notice that different $ans(X)$ computations very often share $Y$ sets.\n\n    We will reverse the formula of inclusion-exclusion and sum in terms of $Y$ sets. Now it becomes clear that the same set $Y$ would be taken into account in the computation of $ans(X)$ of $\\binom{|Y|}{k}$ sets with the same sign $(-1)^{|Y| - k}$.\n\n    $$ ans = \\sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \\ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|}{k} \\cdot f(Y) $$\n\n    Now our solution has asymptotics $O(2^k \\cdot k)$.\n\n    We will now solve the second version of the problem: find the number of strings that match **at least** $k$ of the patterns.\n\n    Of course, we can just use the solution to the first version of the problem and add the answers for sets with size greater than $k$. However, you may notice that in this problem, a set |Y| is considered in the formula for all sets with size $\\ge k$ which are contained in $Y$. That said, we can write the part of the expression that is being multiplied by $f(Y)$ as:\n\n\n    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|}{k} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-1} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|}{k+1} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-2} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|}{k+2} + \\cdots + (-1)^{|Y|-|Y|} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|}{|Y|} $$\n\n    Looking at Graham's (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. \"Concrete mathematics\" [1998] ), we see a well-known formula for [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):\n\n    $$ \\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \\cdot \\binom{n}{k} = (-1)^m \\cdot \\binom{n-1}{m} $$\n\n    Applying it here, we find that the entire sum of binomial coefficients is minimized:\n\n    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} $$\n\n    Thus, for this task, we also obtained a solution with the asymptotics $O(2^k \\cdot k)$:\n\n    $$ ans = \\sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \\ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \\cdot \\binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} \\cdot f(Y) $$\n\n    ### The number of ways of going from a cell to another\n\n    There is a field $n \\times m$, and $k$ of its cells are impassable walls. A robot is initially at the cell $(1,1)$ (bottom left). The robot can only move right or up, and eventually it needs to get into the cell $(n,m)$, avoiding all obstacles. You need to count the number of ways he can do it.\n\n    Assume that the sizes $n$ and $m$ are very large (say, $10^9$), and the number $k$ is small (around $100$).\n\n    For now, sort the obstacles by their coordinate $x$, and in case of equality \u2014 coordinate $y$.\n\n    Also just learn how to solve a problem without obstacles: i.e. learn how to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another. In one axis, we need to go through $x$ cells, and on the other, $y$ cells. From simple combinatorics, we get a formula using [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):\n\n    $$\\binom{x+y}{x}$$\n\n    Now to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another, avoiding all obstacles, you can use inclusion-exclusion to solve the inverse problem: count the number of ways to walk through the board stepping at a subset of obstacles (and subtract it from the total number of ways).\n\n    When iterating over a subset of the obstacles that we'll step, to count the number of ways to do this simply multiply the number of all paths from starting cell to the first of the selected obstacles, a first obstacle to the second, and so on, and then add or subtract this number from the answer, in accordance with the standard formula of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n    However, this will again be non-polynomial in complexity $O(2^k \\cdot k)$.\n\n    Here goes a polynomial solution:\n\n    We will use dynamic programming. For convenience, push (1,1) to the beginning and (n,m) at the end of the obstacles array. Let's compute the numbers $d[i]$ \u2014 the number of ways to get from the starting point ($0-th$) to $i-th$, without stepping on any other obstacle (except for $i$, of course). We will compute this number for all the obstacle cells, and also for the ending one.\n\n    Let's forget for a second the obstacles and just count the number of paths from cell $0$ to $i$. We need to consider some \"bad\" paths, the ones that pass through the obstacles, and subtract them from the total number of ways of going from $0$ to $i$.\n\n    When considering an obstacle $t$ between $0$ and $i$ ($0 < t < i$), on which we can step, we see that the number of paths from $0$ to $i$ that pass through $t$ which have $t$ as the **first obstacle between start and $i$**. We can compute that as: $d[t]$ multiplied by the number of arbitrary paths from $t$ to $i$. We can count the number of \"bad\" ways summing this for all $t$ between $0$ and $i$.\n\n    We can compute $d[i]$ in $O(k)$ for $O(k)$ obstacles, so this solution has complexity $O(k^2)$.\n\n    ### The number of coprime quadruples\n\n    You're given $n$ numbers: $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. You are required to count the number of ways to choose four numbers so that their combined greatest common divisor is equal to one.\n\n    We will solve the inverse problem \u2014 compute the number of \"bad\" quadruples, i.e. quadruples in which all numbers are divisible by a number $d > 1$.\n\n    We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle while summing over all possible groups of four numbers divisible by a divisor $d$.\n\n    $$ans = \\sum_{d \\ge 2} (-1)^{deg(d)-1} \\cdot f(d)$$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n    Part: 2/5\n    <div id=\"the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation\"></div>\n    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }\n\n    Consider the following equation:\n\n    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$\n\n    where $0 \\le x_i \\le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\\ldots 6)$.\n\n    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.\n\n    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):\n    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:\n\n    $$N_0 = \\binom{25}{5}$$\n\n    We will now calculate the number of \"bad\" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The \"bad\" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.\n\n    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \\ge 9$, and all other $x_i \\ge 0 ~ (i \\ne k)$ (they may be $\\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:\n\n    $$ | A_k | = \\binom{16}{5} $$\n\n    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \\ne p$) is equal to:\n\n    $$ \\left| A_k \\cap A_p \\right| = \\binom{7}{5}$$\n\n    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.\n\n    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:\n\n    $$\\binom{25}{5} - \\left(\\binom{6}{1} \\cdot \\binom{16}{5} - \\binom{6}{2} \\cdot \\binom{7}{5}\\right) $$\n\n    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval\n\n    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).\n\n    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.\n\n    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\\cdots k)$.\n\n    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:\n\n    $$ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{ r }{ p_i } \\right\\rfloor $$\n\n    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.\n\n    Here is a C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int solve (int n, int r) {\n    \tvector<int> p;\n    \tfor (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)\n    \t\tif (n % i == 0) {\n    \t\t\tp.push_back (i);\n    \t\t\twhile (n % i == 0)\n    \t\t\t\tn /= i;\n    \t\t}\n    \tif (n > 1)\n    \t\tp.push_back (n);\n\n    \tint sum = 0;\n    \tfor (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {\n    \t\tint mult = 1,\n    \t\t\tbits = 0;\n    \t\tfor (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)\n    \t\t\tif (msk & (1<<i)) {\n    \t\t\t\t++bits;\n    \t\t\t\tmult *= p[i];\n    \t\t\t}\n\n    \t\tint cur = r / mult;\n    \t\tif (bits % 2 == 1)\n    \t\t\tsum += cur;\n    \t\telse\n    \t\t\tsum -= cur;\n    \t}\n\n    \treturn r - sum;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
