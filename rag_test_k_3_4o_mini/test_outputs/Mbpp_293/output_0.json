    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle when the lengths of the other two sides are given. The function should return the length of the hypotenuse based on the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the length of the third side (the hypotenuse) of a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). The formula is: \n   \\[\n   c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n   We will implement this formula in a function that takes two parameters (the lengths of the two sides) and returns the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function otherside_rightangle(a, b):\n       c_squared = a^2 + b^2\n       c = sqrt(c_squared)\n       return c\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Function to calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle\ndef otherside_rightangle(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the square of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem\n    c_squared = a**2 + b**2\n    # Calculate the length of the hypotenuse\n    c = c_squared**0.5\n    # Return the length of the hypotenuse\n    return c\n```",
