INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/421 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple containing various elements (strings and integers) and concatenates them into a single string, with each element separated by a hyphen ("-").

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will define a function that accepts a tuple as an argument.
   - We will convert each element of the tuple to a string (since the tuple can contain integers).
   - We will then join these string elements together using a hyphen as the delimiter.
   - Finally, we will return the resulting concatenated string.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION concatenate_tuple(input_tuple):
       CONVERT each element of input_tuple to string
       JOIN the string elements with "-" as the delimiter

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 2/4
    ```

    This is an **online** algorithm, i.e. it processes the data as it arrives - for example, you can read the string characters one by one and process them immediately, finding the value of prefix function for each next character.
    The algorithm still requires storing the string itself and the previously calculated values of prefix function, but if we know beforehand the maximum value $M$ the prefix function can take on the string, we can store only $M+1$ first characters of the string and the same number of values of the prefix function.

    ## Applications

    ### Search for a substring in a string. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm

    The task is the classical application of the prefix function.

    Given a text $t$ and a string $s$, we want to find and display the positions of all occurrences of the string $s$ in the text $t$.

    For convenience we denote with $n$ the length of the string s and with $m$ the length of the text $t$.

    We generate the string $s + \# + t$, where $\#$ is a separator that appears neither in $s$ nor in $t$.
    Let us calculate the prefix function for this string.
    Now think about the meaning of the values of the prefix function, except for the first $n + 1$ entries (which belong to the string $s$ and the separator).
    By definition the value $\pi[i]$ shows the longest length of a substring ending in position $i$ that coincides with the prefix.
    But in our case this is nothing more than the largest block that coincides with $s$ and ends at position $i$.
    This length cannot be bigger than $n$ due to the separator.
    But if equality $\pi[i] = n$ is achieved, then it means that the string $s$ appears completely in at this position, i.e. it ends at position $i$.
    Just do not forget that the positions are indexed in the string $s + \# + t$.

    Thus if at some position $i$ we have $\pi[i] = n$, then at the position $i - (n + 1) - n + 1 = i - 2n$ in the string $t$ the string $s$ appears.

    As already mentioned in the description of the prefix function computation, if we know that the prefix values never exceed a certain value, then we do not need to store the entire string and the entire function, but only its beginning.
    In our case this means that we only need to store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it.
    We can read one character at a time of the string $t$ and calculate the current value of the prefix function.

    Thus the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm solves the problem in $O(n + m)$ time and $O(n)$ memory.

    ### Counting the number of occurrences of each prefix

    Here we discuss two problems at once.
    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    In the first variation of the problem we want to count the number of appearances of each prefix $s[0 \dots i]$ in the same string.
    In the second variation of the problem another string $t$ is given and we want to count the number of appearances of each prefix $s[0 \dots i]$ in $t$.

    First we solve the first problem.
    Consider the value of the prefix function $\pi[i]$ at a position $i$.
    By definition it means that the prefix of length $\pi[i]$ of the string $s$ occurs and ends at position $i$, and there is no longer prefix that follows this definition.
    At the same time shorter prefixes can end at this position.
    It is not difficult to see, that we have the same question that we already answered when we computed the prefix function itself:
    Given a prefix of length $j$ that is a suffix ending at position $i$, what is the next smaller prefix $\lt j$ that is also a suffix ending at position $i$.
    Thus at the position $i$ ends the prefix of length $\pi[i]$, the prefix of length $\pi[\pi[i] - 1]$, the prefix $\pi[\pi[\pi[i] - 1] - 1]$, and so on, until the index becomes zero.
    Thus we can compute the answer in the following way.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_count_each_prefix}
    vector<int> ans(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        ans[pi[i]]++;
    for (int i = n-1; i > 0; i--)
        ans[pi[i-1]] += ans[i];
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
        ans[i]++;

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 1/5
    # The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

    The inclusion-exclusion principle is an important combinatorial way to compute the size of a set or the probability of complex events. It relates the sizes of individual sets with their union.

    ## Statement

    ### The verbal formula

    The inclusion-exclusion principle can be expressed as follows:

    To compute the size of a union of multiple sets, it is necessary to sum the sizes of these sets **separately**, and then subtract the sizes of all **pairwise** intersections of the sets, then add back the size of the intersections of **triples** of the sets, subtract the size of **quadruples** of the sets, and so on, up to the intersection of **all** sets.

    ### The formulation in terms of sets

    The above definition can be expressed mathematically as follows:

    $$\left| \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{i=1}^n|A_i| - \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} |A_i \cap A_j| + \sum _{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}|A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} | A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n |$$

    And in a more compact way:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\Biggl |}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr |}$$

    ### The formulation using Venn diagrams

    Let the diagram show three sets $A$, $B$ and $C$:

    ![Venn diagram](venn-inclusion-exclusion.png "Venn diagram")

    Then the area of their union $A \cup B \cup C$ is equal to the sum of the areas $A$, $B$ and $C$ less double-covered areas $A \cap B$, $A \cap C$, $B \cap C$, but with the addition of the area covered by three sets $A \cap B \cap C$:

    $$S(A \cup B \cup C) = S(A) + S(B) + S(C) - S(A \cap B) - S(A \cap C) - S(B \cap C) + S(A \cap B \cap C)$$

    It can also be generalized for an association of $n$ sets.

    ### The formulation in terms of probability theory

    If $A_i$ $(i = 1,2...n)$ are events and ${\cal P}(A_i)$ the probability of an event from $A_i$ to occur, then the probability of their union (i.e. the probability that at least one of the events occur) is equal to:

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    {\cal P} \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right) &=& \sum_{i=1}^n{\cal P}(A_i)\ - \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} {\cal P}(A_i \cap A_j)\  + \\
    &+& \sum _{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}{\cal P}(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k) - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} {\cal P}( A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n )
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    And in a more compact way:

    $${\cal P} \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right) = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\ {\cal P}{\Biggl (}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr )}$$

    ## Proof

    For the proof it is convenient to use the mathematical formulation in terms of set theory:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\Biggl |}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr |}$$

    We want to prove that any element contained in at least one of the sets $A_i$ will occur in the formula only once (note that elements which are not present in any of the sets $A_i$ will never be considered on the right part of the formula).

    Consider an element $x$ occurring in $k \geq 1$ sets $A_i$. We will show it is counted only once in the formula. Note that:

    * in terms which $|J| = 1$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\ k$** times;
    * in terms which $|J| = 2$, the item $x$ will be counted **$-\ \binom{k}{2}$** times - because it will be counted in those terms that include two of the $k$ sets containing $x$;
    * in terms which $|J| = 3$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\ \binom{k}{3}$** times;
    * $\cdots$
    * in terms which $|J| = k$, the item $x$ will be counted **$(-1)^{k-1}\cdot \binom{k}{k}$** times;
    * in terms which $|J| \gt k$, the item $x$ will be counted **zero** times;

    This leads us to the following sum of [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ T = \binom{k}{1} - \binom{k}{2} + \binom{k}{3} - \cdots + (-1)^{i-1}\cdot \binom{k}{i} + \cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\cdot \binom{k}{k}$$

    This expression is very similar to the binomial expansion of $(1 - x)^k$:

    $$ (1 - x)^k = \binom{k}{0} - \binom{k}{1} \cdot x + \binom{k}{2} \cdot x^2 - \binom{k}{3} \cdot x^3 + \cdots + (-1)^k\cdot \binom{k}{k} \cdot x^k $$

    When $x = 1$, $(1 - x)^k$ looks a lot like $T$. However, the expression has an additional $\binom{k}{0} = 1$, and it is multiplied by $-1$. That leads us to $(1 - 1)^k = 1 - T$. Therefore $T = 1 - (1 - 1)^k = 1$, what was required to prove. The element is counted only once.

    ## Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly $r$ sets {data-toc-label="Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly r sets"}

    Inclusion-exclusion principle can be rewritten to calculate number of elements which are present in zero sets:

    $$\left|\bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A_i}\right|=\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \sum_{|X|=m} \left|\bigcap_{i\in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    Consider its generalization to calculate number of elements which are present in exactly $r$ sets:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{|B|=r}\left[\bigcap_{i \in B} A_i \cap \bigcap_{j \not\in B} \overline{A_j}\right]\right|=\sum_{m=r}^n (-1)^{m-r}\dbinom{m}{r} \sum_{|X|=m} \left|\bigcap_{i \in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    To prove this formula, consider some particular $B$. Due to basic inclusion-exclusion principle we can say about it that:

    $$\left|\bigcap_{i \in B} A_i \cap \bigcap_{j \not \in B} \overline{A_j}\right|=\sum_{m=r}^{n} (-1)^{m-r} \sum_{\substack{|X|=m \newline B \subset X}}\left|\bigcap_{i\in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    The sets on the left side do not intersect for different $B$, thus we can sum them up directly. Also one should note that any set $X$ will always have coefficient $(-1)^{m-r}$ if it occurs and it will occur for exactly $\dbinom{m}{r}$ sets $B$. 

    ## Usage when solving problems

    The inclusion-exclusion principle is hard to understand without studying its applications.

    First, we will look at three simplest tasks "at paper", illustrating applications of the principle, and then consider more practical problems which are difficult to solve without inclusion-exclusion principle.

    Tasks asking to "find the **number** of ways" are worth of note, as they sometimes lead to polynomial solutions, not necessarily exponential.

    ### A simple task on permutations

    Task: count how many permutations of numbers from $0$ to $9$ exist such that the first element is greater than $1$ and the last one is less than $8$.

    Let's count the number of "bad" permutations, that is, permutations in which the first element is $\leq 1$ and/or the last is $\geq 8$.

    We will denote by $X$ the set of permutations in which the first element is $\leq 1$ and $Y$ the set of permutations in which the last element is $\geq 8$. Then the number of "bad" permutations, as on the inclusion-exclusion formula, will be:

    $$ |X \cup Y| = |X| + |Y| - |X \cap Y| $$

    After a simple combinatorial calculation, we will get to:

    $$ 2 \cdot 9! + 2 \cdot 9! - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 8! $$

    The only thing left is to subtract this number from the total of $10!$ to get the number of "good" permutations.

    ### A simple task on (0, 1, 2) sequences

    Task: count how many sequences of length $n$ exist consisting only of numbers $0,1,2$ such that each number occurs **at least once**.

    Again let us turn to the inverse problem, i.e. we calculate the number of sequences which do **not** contain **at least one** of the numbers.

    Let's denote by $A_i (i = 0,1,2)$ the set of sequences in which the digit $i$ does **not** occur.
    The formula of inclusion-exclusion on the number of "bad" sequences will be:

    $$ |A_0 \cup A_1 \cup A_2| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_0 \cap A_1| - |A_0 \cap A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_2| + |A_0 \cap A_1 \cap A_2| $$

    * The size of each $A_i$ is $2^n$, as each sequence can only contain two of the digits.
    * The size of each pairwise intersection $A_i \cap A_j$  is equal to $1$, as there will be only one digit to build the sequence.
    * The size of the intersection of all three sets is equal to $0$, as there will be no digits to build the sequence.

    As we solved the inverse problem, we subtract it from the total of $3^n$ sequences:

    $$3^n - (3 \cdot 2^n - 3 \cdot 1 + 0)$$

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/421 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of elements (which can be strings or integers) and concatenates them into a single string, with each element separated by a hyphen ("-").

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each element in the tuple, convert each element to a string (if it isn't already), and then join these string representations together using the hyphen as a delimiter.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function concatenate_tuple(input_tuple):
       convert each element in input_tuple to string
       join all string elements with "-" as the delimiter
       return the resulting string
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

    # Convert each element in the tuple to a string
    string_elements = [str(element) for element in input_tuple]
    # Join all string elements with "-" as the delimiter
