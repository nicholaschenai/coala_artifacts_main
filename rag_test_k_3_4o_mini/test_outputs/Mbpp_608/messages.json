(In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).\n\n    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):\n\n     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \\ldots$\n\n    ### Application in some combinatorial problems\n\n    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for\n\n    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.\n    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.\n    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.\n    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).\n    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.\n    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).\n    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \\times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).\n    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).\n    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.\n    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \\ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).\n\n\n    ## Calculations\n\n    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.\n\n    ### Recursive formula\n \n    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$\n\n    $$C_n = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \\geq 2$$\n\n    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.\n\n    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :\n\n    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    #### C++ implementation \n\n    ```cpp\n    const int MOD = ....\n    const int MAX = ....\n    int catalan[MAX];\n    void init() {\n        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;\n        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {\n            catalan[i] = 0;\n            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {\n                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;\n                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {\n                    catalan[i] -= MOD;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Analytical formula\n\n    $$C_n = \\frac{1}{n + 1} {\\binom{2n}{n}}$$\n\n    (here $\\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).\n\n    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \\times n$ is given by $\\binom{2n}{n}$.\n\n    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \\times n$.\n\n    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ are $\\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as \"bad\" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above \"bad\" paths, obtaining the formula:\n\n    $$C_n = \\binom{2n}{n} - \\binom{2n}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\binom{2n}{n} , {n} \\geq 0$$\n\n    ## Reference\n\n    - [Catalan Number by Tom Davis](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/catalan.pdf)\n[/Textbook Reference

\\key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting\n    combinations of objects.\n    Usually, the goal is to find a way to\n    count the combinations efficiently\n    without generating each combination separately.\n\n    As an example, consider the problem\n    of counting the number of ways to\n    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.\n    For example, there are 8 representations\n    for $4$:\n    \\begin{multicols}{2}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $1+1+1+1$\n    \\item $1+1+2$\n    \\item $1+2+1$\n    \\item $2+1+1$\n    \\item $2+2$\n    \\item $3+1$\n    \\item $1+3$\n    \\item $4$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{multicols}\n\n    A combinatorial problem can often be solved\n    using a recursive function.\n    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$\n    that gives the number of representations for $n$.\n    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.\n    The values of the function\n    can be recursively calculated as follows:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n                   1               & n = 0\\\\\n                   f(0)+f(1)+\\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case is $f(0)=1$,\n    because the empty sum represents the number 0.\n    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to\n    choose the first number of the sum.\n    If the first number is $k$,\n    there are $f(n-k)$ representations\n    for the remaining part of the sum.\n    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values\n    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.\n\n    The first values for the function are:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    f(0) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    f(3) & = & 4 \\\\\n    f(4) & = & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced\n    with a closed-form formula.\n    In this problem,\n    \\[\n    f(n)=2^{n-1},\n    \\]\n    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$\n    possible positions for +-signs in the sum\n    and we can choose any subset of them.\n\n    \\section{Binomial coefficients}\n\n    \\index{binomial coefficient}\n\n    The \\key{binomial coefficient} ${n \\choose k}$\n    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset\n    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, ${5 \\choose 3}=10$,\n    because the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:\n    \\[ \\{1,2,3\\}, \\{1,2,4\\}, \\{1,2,5\\}, \\{1,3,4\\}, \\{1,3,5\\}, \n    \\{1,4,5\\}, \\{2,3,4\\}, \\{2,3,5\\}, \\{2,4,5\\}, \\{3,4,5\\} \\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 1}\n\n    Binomial coefficients can be\n    recursively calculated as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k}\n    \\]\n\n    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.\n    If $x$ is included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k-1$\n    elements from $n-1$ elements,\n    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.\n\n    The base cases for the recursion are\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}  =  {n \\choose n} = 1,\n    \\]\n    because there is always exactly\n    one way to construct an empty subset\n    and a subset that contains all the elements.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 2}\n\n    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\n    \\]\n\n    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.\n    We go through all permutations and always\n    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation\n    in the subset.\n    Since the order of the elements in the subset\n    and outside the subset does not matter,\n    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$\n\n    \\subsubsection{Properties}\n\n    For binomial coefficients,\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n \\choose n-k},\n    \\]\n    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into\n    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements\n    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.\n\n    The sum of binomial coefficients is\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}+{n \\choose 1}+{n \\choose 2}+\\ldots+{n \\choose n}=2^n.\n    \\]\n\n    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''\n    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to\n    the $n$th power:\n\n    \\[ (a+b)^n =\n    {n \\choose 0} a^n b^0 + \n    {n \\choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +\n    \\ldots + \n    {n \\choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +\n    {n \\choose n} a^0 b^n. \\]\n\n    \\index{Pascal's triangle}\n\n    Binomial coefficients also appear in\n    \\key{Pascal's triangle}\n    where each value equals the sum of two\n    above values:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}{0.9}\n    \\node at (0,0) {1};\n    \\node at (-0.5,-0.5)

Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The Bell numbers count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. The function should return the nth Bell number, and it should pass the assertion that the Bell number for n=2 is 2.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   The Bell numbers can be computed using a recursive relationship. The Bell number B(n) can be defined as:\n   - B(0) = 1 (the empty set has one partition)\n   - B(n) = \u03a3 (from k=0 to n-1) of (C(n-1, k) * B(k)), where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose k elements from n elements.\n\n   We can use a 2D list (or array) to store the Bell numbers and compute them iteratively. The outer loop will iterate through the number of elements, and the inner loop will compute the Bell number for that number of elements using previously computed Bell numbers.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function bell_Number(n):\n       create a 2D list bell of size (n+1) x (n+1)\n       initialize bell[0][0] = 1\n       \n       for i from 1 to n:\n           bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]\n           for j from 1 to i:\n               bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]\n       \n       return bell[n][0]\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef bell_Number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Create a 2D list to store Bell numbers\n    bell = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Base case\n    bell[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the Bell triangle\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # The first value in each row is the last value of the previous row\n        bell[i][0] = bell[i - 1][i - 1]\n        \n        # Fill the rest of the current row\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            bell[i][j] = bell[i - 1][j - 1] + bell[i][j - 1]\n    \n    # The nth Bell number is in the first column of the nth row\n    return bell[n][0]\n```"
