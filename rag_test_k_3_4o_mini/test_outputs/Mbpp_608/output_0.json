    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   The task is to write a Python function that calculates the nth Bell number. The Bell numbers count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. The function should return the nth Bell number, and it should pass the assertion that the Bell number for n=2 is 2.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   The Bell numbers can be computed using a recursive relationship. The Bell number B(n) can be defined as:\n   - B(0) = 1 (the empty set has one partition)\n   - B(n) = \u03a3 (from k=0 to n-1) of (C(n-1, k) * B(k)), where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose k elements from n elements.\n\n   We can use a 2D list (or array) to store the Bell numbers and compute them iteratively. The outer loop will iterate through the number of elements, and the inner loop will compute the Bell number for that number of elements using previously computed Bell numbers.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function bell_Number(n):\n       create a 2D list bell of size (n+1) x (n+1)\n       initialize bell[0][0] = 1\n       \n       for i from 1 to n:\n           bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]\n           for j from 1 to i:\n               bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]\n       \n       return bell[n][0]\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef bell_Number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Create a 2D list to store Bell numbers\n    bell = [[0 for _ in range(n + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Base case\n    bell[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the Bell triangle\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # The first value in each row is the last value of the previous row\n        bell[i][0] = bell[i - 1][i - 1]\n        \n        # Fill the rest of the current row\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            bell[i][j] = bell[i - 1][j - 1] + bell[i][j - 1]\n    \n    # The nth Bell number is in the first column of the nth row\n    return bell[n][0]\n```",
