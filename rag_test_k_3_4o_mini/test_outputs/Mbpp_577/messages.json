\\bmod p$, without taking all the multiple factors of $p$ into account that appear in the factorial.\n    Imaging you write down the prime factorization of $n!$, remove all factors $p$, and compute the product modulo $p$.\n    We will denote this *modified* factorial with $n!_{\\%p}$.\n    For instance $7!_{\\%p} \\equiv 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{3} \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\underbrace{2}_{6} \\cdot 7 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 3$.\n\n    Learning how to effectively calculate this modified factorial allows us to quickly calculate the value of the various combinatorial formulas (for example, [Binomial coefficients](../combinatorics/binomial-coefficients.md)).\n\n    ## Algorithm\n    Let's write this modified factorial explicitly.\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    n!_{\\%p} &=& 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p} \\cdot (p+1) \\cdot (p+2) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (2p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{2}_{2p} \\\\\\\n     & &\\quad \\cdot (2p+1) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p^2-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p^2} \\cdot (p^2 +1) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n \\pmod{p} \\\\\\\\\n    &=& 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{2}_{2p} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\\\\\\n    & &\\quad \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot \\underbrace{1}_{p^2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (n \\bmod p) \\pmod{p}\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    It can be clearly seen that factorial is divided into several blocks of same length except for the last one.\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    n!_{\\%p}&=& \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot 1}_{1\\text{st}} \\cdot \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot 2}_{2\\text{nd}} \\cdot \\ldots \\\\\\\\\n    & & \\cdot \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (p-2) \\cdot (p-1) \\cdot 1}_{p\\text{th}} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\quad \\underbrace{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot (n \\bmod p)}_{\\text{tail}} \\pmod{p}.\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    The main part of the blocks it is easy to count \u2014 it's just $(p-1)!\\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ p$.\n    We can compute that programmatically or just apply Wilson theorem which states that $(p-1)! \\bmod p = -1$ for any prime $p$.\n\n    We have exactly $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\rfloor$ such blocks, therefore we need to raise $-1$ to the power of $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p} \\rfloor$.\n    This can be done in logarithmic time using [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md); however you can also notice that the result will switch between $-1$ and $1$, so we only need to look at the parity of the exponent and multiply by $-1$ if the parity is odd.\n    And instead of a multiplication, we can also just subtract the current result from $p$.\n\n    The value of the last partial block can be calculated separately in $O(p)$.\n\n\n    This leaves only the last element of each block.\n    If we hide the already handled elements, we can see the following pattern:\n\n    $$n!_{\\%p} = \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 1 } \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot (p-1)} \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 1 } \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 1} \\cdot \\underbrace{ \\ldots \\cdot 2} \\cdots$$\n\n    This again is a *modified* factorial, only with a much smaller dimension.\n    It's $\\lfloor n / p \\rfloor !_{\\%p}$.\n\n    Thus, during the calculation of the *modified* factorial $n\\!_{\\%p}$ we did $O(p)$ operations and are left with the calculation of $\\lfloor n / p \\rfloor !_{\\%p}$.\n    We have a recursive formula.\n    The recursion depth is $O(\\log_p n)$, and therefore the complete asymptotic behavior of the algorithm is $O(p \\log_p n)$.\n\n    Notice, if you precompute the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ 2!,~ \\dots,~ (p-1)!$ modulo $p$, then the complexity will just be $O(\\log_p n)$.\n\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    We don't need recursion because this is a case of tail recursion and thus can be easily implemented using iteration.\n    In the following implementation we precompute the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ \\dots,~ (p-1)!$, and thus have the runtime $O(p + \\log_p n)$.\n    If you need to call the function multiple times, then you can do the precomputation outside of the function and do the computation of $n!_{\\%p}$ in $O(\\log_p n)$ time.\n\n    ```cpp\n    int factmod(int n, int p) {\n        vector<int> f(p);\n        f[0] = 1;\n        for (int i = 1; i < p; i++)\n            f[i] = f[i-1] * i % p;\n\n        int res = 1;\n        while (n > 1) {\n            if ((n/p) % 2)\n                res = p - res;\n            res = res * f[n%p] % p;\n            n /= p;\n        }\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Alternative, if you only have limit memory and can't afford storing all factorials, you can also just remember the factorials that you need, sort them, and then compute them in one sweep by computing the factorials $0!,~ 1!,~ 2!,~ \\dots,~ (p-1)!$ in a loop without storing them explicitly.\n\n    ## Multiplicity of $p$\n\n    If we want to compute a Binomial coefficient modulo $p$, then we additionally need the multiplicity of the $p$ in $n$, i.e. the number of times $p$ occurs in the prime factorization of $n$, or number of times we erased $p$ during the computation of the *modified* factorial.\n\n    [Legendre's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula) gives us a way to compute this in $O(\\log_p n)$ time.\n    The formula gives the multiplicity $\\nu_p$ as:\n\n    $$\\nu_p(n!) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^i} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\n    Thus we get the implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int multiplicity_factorial(int n, int p) {\n        int count = 0;\n        do {\n            n /= p;\n            count += n;\n        } while (n);\n        return count;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can be proven very easily using the same ideas that we did in the previous sections.\n    Remove all elements that don't contain the factor $p$.\n    This leaves $\\lfloor n/p \\rfloor$ element remaining.\n    If we remove the factor $p$ from each of them, we get the product $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdots \\lfloor n/p \\rfloor = \\lfloor n/p \\rfloor !$, and again we have a recursion.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Josephus Problem\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Josephus Problem\n\n    ## Statement\n\n    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.\n    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. \n    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.\n    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.\n    The process stops when one number remains.\n    It is required to find the last number.\n\n    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).\n\n    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.\n    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Continued fractions\n    Part: 7/12\n    === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            # compute the continued fraction of sqrt(n)\n            def sqrt(n):\n                n0 = math.floor(math.sqrt(n))\n                x, y, z = 1, 0, 1\n                a = []\n                def step(x, y, z):\n                    a.append((x * n0 + y) // z)\n                    t = y - a[-1]*z\n                    x, y, z = -z*x, z*t, t**2 - n*x**2\n                    g = math.gcd(x, math.gcd(y, z))\n                    return x // g, y // g, z // g\n\n                used = dict()\n                for i in range(n):\n                    used[x, y, z] = i\n                    x, y, z = step(x, y, z)\n                    if (x, y, z) in used:\n                        return a\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
