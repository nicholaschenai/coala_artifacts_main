    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a number `n` and returns the largest integer that is smaller than `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the closest smaller number than `n`, we can simply subtract 1 from `n`. This works because the closest integer less than any integer `n` is `n - 1`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION closest_num(n):\n       RETURN n - 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to find the closest smaller number than n\ndef closest_num(n: int) -> int:\n    # The closest smaller number than n is simply n - 1\n    return n - 1\n```",
