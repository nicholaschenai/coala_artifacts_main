    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 3/5
    ```

    Asymptotics of the solution is $O (\sqrt{n})$.

    ### The number of integers in a given interval which are multiple of at least one of the given numbers

    Given $n$ numbers $a_i$ and number $r$. You want to count the number of integers in the interval $[1; r]$ that are multiple of at least one of the $a_i$.

    The solution algorithm is almost identical to the one for previous task â€” construct the formula of inclusion-exclusion on the numbers $a_i$, i.e. each term in this formula is the number of numbers divisible by a given subset of numbers $a_i$ (in other words, divisible by their [least common multiple](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md)).

    So we will now iterate over all $2^n$ subsets of integers $a_i$ with $O(n \log r)$ operations to find their least common multiple, adding or subtracting the number of multiples of it in the interval. Asymptotics is $O (2^n\cdot n\cdot \log r)$.

    ### The number of strings that satisfy a given pattern

    Consider $n$ patterns of strings of the same length, consisting only of letters ($a...z$) or question marks. You're also given a number $k$. A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. The task is to count the number of strings that match exactly $k$ of the patterns (first problem) and at least $k$ of the patterns (second problem).

    Notice first that we can easily count the number of strings that satisfy at once all of the specified patterns. To do this, simply "cross" patterns: iterate though the positions ("slots") and look at a position over all patterns. If all patterns have a question mark in this position, the character can be any letter from $a$ to $z$. Otherwise, the character of this position is uniquely defined by the patterns that do not contain a question mark.

    Learn now to solve the first version of the problem: when the string must satisfy exactly $k$ of the patterns.

    To solve it, iterate and fix a specific subset $X$ from the set of patterns consisting of $k$ patterns. Then we have to count the number of strings that satisfy this set of patterns, and only matches it, that is, they don't match any other pattern. We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a slightly different manner: we sum on all supersets $Y$ (subsets from the original set of strings that contain $X$), and either add to the current answer or subtract it from the number of strings:

    $$ ans(X) = \sum_{Y \supseteq X} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Where $f(Y)$ is the number of strings that match $Y$ (at least $Y$).

    (If you have a hard time figuring out this, you can try drawing Venn Diagrams.)

    If we sum up on all $ans(X)$, we will get the final answer:

    $$ ans = \sum_{X ~ : ~ |X| = k} ans(X) $$

    However, asymptotics of this solution is $O(3^k \cdot k)$. To improve it, notice that different $ans(X)$ computations very often share $Y$ sets.

    We will reverse the formula of inclusion-exclusion and sum in terms of $Y$ sets. Now it becomes clear that the same set $Y$ would be taken into account in the computation of $ans(X)$ of $\binom{|Y|}{k}$ sets with the same sign $(-1)^{|Y| - k}$.

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Now our solution has asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    We will now solve the second version of the problem: find the number of strings that match **at least** $k$ of the patterns.

    Of course, we can just use the solution to the first version of the problem and add the answers for sets with size greater than $k$. However, you may notice that in this problem, a set |Y| is considered in the formula for all sets with size $\ge k$ which are contained in $Y$. That said, we can write the part of the expression that is being multiplied by $f(Y)$ as:


    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-1} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+1} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-2} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+2} + \cdots + (-1)^{|Y|-|Y|} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{|Y|} $$

    Looking at Graham's (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. "Concrete mathematics" [1998] ), we see a well-known formula for [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \cdot \binom{n}{k} = (-1)^m \cdot \binom{n-1}{m} $$

    Applying it here, we find that the entire sum of binomial coefficients is minimized:

    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} $$

    Thus, for this task, we also obtained a solution with the asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$:

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    ### The number of ways of going from a cell to another

    There is a field $n \times m$, and $k$ of its cells are impassable walls. A robot is initially at the cell $(1,1)$ (bottom left). The robot can only move right or up, and eventually it needs to get into the cell $(n,m)$, avoiding all obstacles. You need to count the number of ways he can do it.

    Assume that the sizes $n$ and $m$ are very large (say, $10^9$), and the number $k$ is small (around $100$).

    For now, sort the obstacles by their coordinate $x$, and in case of equality â€” coordinate $y$.

    Also just learn how to solve a problem without obstacles: i.e. learn how to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another. In one axis, we need to go through $x$ cells, and on the other, $y$ cells. From simple combinatorics, we get a formula using [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$\binom{x+y}{x}$$

    Now to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another, avoiding all obstacles, you can use inclusion-exclusion to solve the inverse problem: count the number of ways to walk through the board stepping at a subset of obstacles (and subtract it from the total number of ways).

    When iterating over a subset of the obstacles that we'll step, to count the number of ways to do this simply multiply the number of all paths from starting cell to the first of the selected obstacles, a first obstacle to the second, and so on, and then add or subtract this number from the answer, in accordance with the standard formula of inclusion-exclusion.

    However, this will again be non-polynomial in complexity $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    Here goes a polynomial solution:

    We will use dynamic programming. For convenience, push (1,1) to the beginning and (n,m) at the end of the obstacles array. Let's compute the numbers $d[i]$ â€” the number of ways to get from the starting point ($0-th$) to $i-th$, without stepping on any other obstacle (except for $i$, of course). We will compute this number for all the obstacle cells, and also for the ending one.

    Let's forget for a second the obstacles and just count the number of paths from cell $0$ to $i$. We need to consider some "bad" paths, the ones that pass through the obstacles, and subtract them from the total number of ways of going from $0$ to $i$.

    When considering an obstacle $t$ between $0$ and $i$ ($0 < t < i$), on which we can step, we see that the number of paths from $0$ to $i$ that pass through $t$ which have $t$ as the **first obstacle between start and $i$**. We can compute that as: $d[t]$ multiplied by the number of arbitrary paths from $t$ to $i$. We can count the number of "bad" ways summing this for all $t$ between $0$ and $i$.

    We can compute $d[i]$ in $O(k)$ for $O(k)$ obstacles, so this solution has complexity $O(k^2)$.

    ### The number of coprime quadruples

    You're given $n$ numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You are required to count the number of ways to choose four numbers so that their combined greatest common divisor is equal to one.

    We will solve the inverse problem â€” compute the number of "bad" quadruples, i.e. quadruples in which all numbers are divisible by a number $d > 1$.

    We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle while summing over all possible groups of four numbers divisible by a divisor $d$.

    $$ans = \sum_{d \ge 2} (-1)^{deg(d)-1} \cdot f(d)$$
[/Textbook Reference Material]


[Textbook Reference Material]:
    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 4/5
    where $deg(d)$ is the number of primes in the factorization of the number $d$ and $f(d)$ the number of quadruples divisible by $d$.

    To calculate the function $f(d)$, you just have to count the number of multiples of $d$ (as mentioned on a previous task) and use [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md) to count the number of ways to choose four of them.

    Thus, using the formula of inclusions-exclusions we sum the number of groups of four divisible by a prime number, then subtract the number of quadruples which are divisible by the product of two primes, add quadruples divisible by three primes, etc.


    ### The number of harmonic triplets

    You are given a number $n \le 10^6$. You are required to count the number of triples $2 \le a < b < c \le n$ that satisfy one of the following conditions:

    * or ${\rm gcd}(a,b) = {\rm gcd}(a,c) = {\rm gcd}(b,c) = 1$,
    * or ${\rm gcd}(a,b) > 1, {\rm gcd}(a,c) > 1, {\rm gcd}(b,c) > 1$.

    First, go straight to the inverse problem â€” i.e. count the number of non-harmonic triples.

    Second, note that any non-harmonic triplet is made of a pair of coprimes and a third number that is not coprime with at least one from the pair.

    Thus, the number of non-harmonic triples that contain $i$ is equal the number of integers from $2$ to $n$ that are coprimes with $i$ multiplied by the number of integers that are not coprime with $i$.

    Either $gcd(a,b) = 1 \wedge gcd(a,c) > 1 \wedge gcd(b,c) > 1$

    or $gcd(a,b) = 1 \wedge gcd(a,c) = 1 \wedge gcd(b,c) > 1$

    In both of these cases, it will be counted twice. The first case will be counted when $i = a$ and when $i = b$. The second case will be counted when $i = b$ and when $i = c$. Therefore, to compute the number of non-harmonic triples, we sum this calculation through all $i$ from $2$ to $n$ and divide it by $2$.

    Now all we have left to solve is to learn to count the number of coprimes to $i$ in the interval $[2;n]$. Although this problem has already been mentioned, the above solution is not suitable here â€” it would require the factorization of each of the integers from $2$ to $n$, and then iterating through all subsets of these primes.

    A faster solution is possible with such modification of the sieve of Eratosthenes:

    1. First, we find all numbers in the interval $[2;n]$ such that its simple factorization does not include a prime factor twice. We will also need to know, for these numbers, how many factors it includes.
        * To do this we will maintain an array $deg[i]$ to store the number of primes in the factorization of $i$, and an array $good[i]$, to mark either if $i$ contains each factor at most once ($good[i] = 1$) or not ($good[i] = 0$). When iterating from $2$ to $n$, if we reach a number that has $deg$ equal to $0$, then it is a prime and its $deg$ is $1$.
        * During the sieve of Eratosthenes, we will iterate $i$ from $2$ to $n$. When processing a prime number we go through all of its multiples and increase their $deg[]$. If one of these multiples is multiple of the square of $i$, then we can put $good$ as false.

    2. Second, we need to calculate the answer for all $i$ from $2$ to $n$, i.e., the array $cnt[]$ â€” the number of integers not coprime with $i$.
        * To do this, remember how the formula of inclusion-exclusion works â€” actually here we implement the same concept, but with inverted logic: we iterate over a component (a product of primes from the factorization) and add or subtract its term on the formula of inclusion-exclusion of each of its multiples.
        * So, let's say we are processing a number $i$ such that $good[i] = true$, i.e., it is involved in the formula of inclusion-exclusion. Iterate through all numbers that are multiples of $i$, and either add or subtract $\lfloor N/i \rfloor$ from their $cnt[]$ (the signal depends on $deg[i]$: if $deg[i]$ is odd, then we must add, otherwise subtract).

    Here's a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int n;
    bool good[MAXN];
    int deg[MAXN], cnt[MAXN];

    long long solve() {
    	memset (good, 1, sizeof good);
    	memset (deg, 0, sizeof deg);
    	memset (cnt, 0, sizeof cnt);

    	long long ans_bad = 0;
    	for (int i=2; i<=n; ++i) {
    		if (good[i]) {
    			if (deg[i] == 0)  deg[i] = 1;
    			for (int j=1; i*j<=n; ++j) {
    				if (j > 1 && deg[i] == 1)
    					if (j % i == 0)
    						good[i*j] = false;
    					else
    						++deg[i*j];
    				cnt[i*j] += (n / i) * (deg[i]%2==1 ? +1 : -1);
    			}
    		}
    		ans_bad += (cnt[i] - 1) * 1ll * (n-1 - cnt[i]);
    	}

    	return (n-1) * 1ll * (n-2) * (n-3) / 6 - ans_bad / 2;
    }
