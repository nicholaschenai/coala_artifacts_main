    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we should calculate \\(1^4 + 3^4\\), which equals 82.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Generate the first `n` odd natural numbers. The first odd number is 1, the second is 3, the third is 5, and so on. The `k`-th odd number can be calculated as \\(2k - 1\\).\n   - For each of these odd numbers, we will compute its fourth power.\n   - Finally, we will sum all these fourth powers together and return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function odd_num_sum(n):\n       sum = 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           odd_number = 2 * i - 1\n           fourth_power = odd_number ** 4\n           sum += fourth_power\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef odd_num_sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    sum = 0\n    # Loop through the first n odd natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th odd number\n        odd_number = 2 * i - 1\n        # Calculate the fourth power of the odd number\n        fourth_power = odd_number ** 4\n        # Add the fourth power to the sum\n        sum += fourth_power\n    # Return the final sum\n    return sum\n```",
