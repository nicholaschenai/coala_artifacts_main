    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a regular pentagon given the length of one of its sides. The perimeter of a pentagon is simply the total length around it, which is five times the length of one side.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: \n   To find the perimeter of a regular pentagon, we can use the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = 5 \\times \\text{side length}\n   \\]\n   This means that if we know the length of one side, we can multiply it by 5 to get the total perimeter.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n       RETURN 5 * side_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef perimeter_pentagon(side_length):\n    # Calculate the perimeter of a regular pentagon\n    return 5 * side_length  # Multiply the side length by 5 to get the perimeter\n```",
