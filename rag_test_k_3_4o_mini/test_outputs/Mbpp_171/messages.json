Pick's theorem provides a way to compute the area of this polygon through the number of vertices that are lying on the boundary and the number of vertices that lie strictly inside the polygon.\n\n    ## Formula\n\n    Given a certain lattice polygon with non-zero area.\n\n    We denote its area by $S$, the number of points with integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon by $I$ and the number of points lying on polygon sides by $B$.\n\n    Then, the **Pick's formula** states:\n\n    $$S=I+\\frac{B}{2}-1$$\n\n    In particular, if the values of $I$ and $B$ for a polygon are given, the area can be calculated in $O(1)$ without even knowing the vertices.\n\n    This formula was discovered and proven by Austrian mathematician Georg Alexander Pick in 1899.\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    The proof is carried out in many stages: from simple polygons to arbitrary ones:\n\n    - A single square: $S=1, I=0, B=4$, which satisfies the formula.\n\n    - An arbitrary non-degenerate rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes: Assume $a$ and $b$ be the length of the sides of rectangle. Then, $S=ab, I=(a-1)(b-1), B=2(a+b)$. On substituting, we see that formula is true.\n\n    - A right angle with legs parallel to the axes: To prove this, note that any such triangle can be obtained by cutting off a rectangle by a diagonal. Denoting the number of integral points lying on diagonal by $c$, it can be shown that Pick's formula holds for this triangle regardless of $c$.\n\n    - An arbitrary triangle: Note that any such triangle can be turned into a rectangle by attaching it to sides of right-angled triangles with legs parallel to the axes (you will not need more than 3 such triangles). From here, we can get correct formula for any triangle.\n\n    - An arbitrary polygon: To prove this, triangulate it, ie, divide into triangles with integral coordinates. Further, it is possible to prove that Pick's theorem retains its validity when a polygon is added to a triangle. Thus, we have proven Pick's formula for arbitrary polygon.\n\n    ## Generalization to higher dimensions\n\n    Unfortunately, this simple and beautiful formula cannot be generalized to higher dimensions.\n\n    John Reeve demonstrated this by proposing a tetrahedron (**Reeve tetrahedron**) with following vertices in 1957:\n\n    $$A=(0,0,0),\n    B=(1,0,0),\n    C=(0,1,0),\n    D=(1,1,k),$$\n\n    where $k$ can be any natural number. Then for any $k$, the tetrahedron $ABCD$ does not contain integer point inside it and has only $4$ points on its borders, $A, B, C, D$. Thus, the volume and surface area may vary in spite of unchanged number of points within and on boundary. Therefore, Pick's theorem doesn't allow generalizations.\n\n    However, higher dimensions still has a generalization using **Ehrhart polynomials** but they are quite complex and depends not only on points inside but also on the boundary of polytype.\n\n    ## Extra Resources\n    A few simple examples and a simple proof of Pick's theorem can be found [here](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/pick.pdf).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Finding the equation of a line for a segment\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Finding the equation of a line for a segment\n\n    The task is: given the coordinates of the ends of a segment, construct a line passing through it.\n\n    We assume that the segment is non-degenerate, i.e. has a length greater than zero (otherwise, of course, infinitely many different lines pass through it).\n\n    ### Two-dimensional case\n\n    Let the given segment be $PQ$ i.e. the known coordinates of its ends $P_x , P_y , Q_x , Q_y$ .\n\n    It is necessary to construct **the equation of a line in the plane** passing through this segment, i.e. find the coefficients $A , B , C$ in the equation of a line:\n\n    $$A x + B y + C = 0.$$\n\n    Note that for the required triples $(A, B, C)$ there are **infinitely many** solutions which describe the given segment:\n    you can multiply all three coefficients by an arbitrary non-zero number and get the same straight line.\n    Therefore, our task is to find one of these triples.\n\n    It is easy to verify (by substitution of these expressions and the coordinates of the points $P$ and $Q$ into the equation of a straight line) that the following set of coefficients fits:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    A &= P_y - Q_y, \\\\\n    B &= Q_x - P_x, \\\\\n    C &= - A P_x - B P_y.\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    ### Integer case\n\n    An important advantage of this method of constructing a straight line is that if the coordinates of the ends were integer, then the coefficients obtained will also be **integer** . In some cases, this allows one to perform geometric operations without resorting to real numbers at all.\n\n    However, there is a small drawback: for the same straight line different triples of coefficients can be obtained.\n    To avoid this, but do not go away from the integer coefficients, you can apply the following technique, often called **rationing**. Find the [greatest common divisor](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md) of numbers $| A | , | B | , | C |$ , we divide all three coefficients by it, and then we make the normalization of the sign: if $A <0$ or $A = 0, B <0$ then multiply all three coefficients by $-1$ .\n    As a result, we will come to the conclusion that for identical straight lines, identical triples of coefficients will be obtained, which makes it easy to check straight lines for equality.\n\n    ### Real case\n\n    When working with real numbers, you should always be aware of errors.\n\n    The coefficients $A$ and $B$ will have the order of the original coordinates, the coefficient $C$ is of the order of the square of them. This may already be quite large numbers, and, for example, when we [intersect straight lines](lines-intersection.md), they will become even larger, which can lead to large rounding errors already when the coordinates of the end points are of order $10^3$.\n\n    Therefore, when working with real numbers, it is desirable to produce the so-called **normalization**, this is straightforward: namely, to make the coefficients such that $A ^ 2 + B ^ 2 = 1$ . To do this, calculate the number $Z$ :\n\n    $$Z = \\sqrt{A ^ 2 + B ^ 2},$$\n\n    and divide all three coefficients $A , B , C$ by it.\n\n    Thus, the order of the coefficients $A$ and $B$ will not depend on the order of the input coordinates, and the coefficient $C$ will be of the same order as the input coordinates. In practice, this leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of calculations.\n\n    Finally, we mention the **comparison** of straight lines - in fact, after such a normalization, for the same straight line, only two triples of coefficients can be obtained: up to multiplication by $-1$.\n    Accordingly, if we make an additional normalization taking into account the sign (if $A < -\\varepsilon$  or $| A | < \\varepsilon$, $B <- \\varepsilon$ then multiply by $-1$ ), the resulting coefficients will be unique.\n\n    ### Three-dimensional and multidimensional case\n\n    Already in the three-dimensional case there is **no simple equation** describing a straight line (it can be defined as the intersection of two planes, that is, a system of two equations, but this is an inconvenient method).\n\n    Consequently, in the three-dimensional and multidimensional cases we must use the **parametric method of defining a straight line** , i.e. as a point $p$ and a vector $v$ :\n\n    $$p + v t, ~~~ t \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\n\n    Those. a straight line is all points that can be obtained from a point $p$ adding a vector $v$ with an arbitrary coefficient.\n\n    The **construction** of a straight line in a parametric form along the coordinates of the ends of a segment is trivial, we just take one end of the segment for the point $p$, and the vector from the first to the second end \u2014 for the vector $v$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
