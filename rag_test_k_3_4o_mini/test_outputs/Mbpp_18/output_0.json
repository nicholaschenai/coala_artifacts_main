    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that takes two strings as input. The first string contains characters that may need to be removed based on the characters present in the second string. The function should return a new string that consists of characters from the first string, excluding any characters that are found in the second string.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the first string and check if it exists in the second string. If it does not exist in the second string, we will include it in the result. We can use a simple loop and a conditional check to achieve this.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_dirty_chars(str1, str2):\n       result = empty string\n       for each character in str1:\n           if character is not in str2:\n               append character to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(str1: str, str2: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty result string\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the first string\n    for char in str1:\n        # If the character is not in the second string, add it to the result\n        if char not in str2:\n            result += char\n            \n    # Return the final result string\n    return result\n```",
