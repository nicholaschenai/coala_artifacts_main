    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and calculates the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, each raised to the fifth power.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. The first `n` even natural numbers can be generated by the formula `2 * i` where `i` ranges from `1` to `n`.\n   - For each of these even numbers, raise it to the fifth power.\n   - Sum all these fifth powers together to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function even_Power_Sum(n):\n       sum = 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           even_number = 2 * i\n           fifth_power = even_number raised to the power of 5\n           sum = sum + fifth_power\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a helper function to calculate the fifth power\ndef fifth_power(x):\n    return x ** 5\n\n# Main function to calculate the sum of the first n even natural numbers raised to the fifth power\ndef even_Power_Sum(n):\n    total_sum = 0  # Initialize the sum to zero\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Loop from 1 to n\n        even_number = 2 * i  # Calculate the i-th even natural number\n        total_sum += fifth_power(even_number)  # Add the fifth power of the even number to the total sum\n    return total_sum  # Return the final sum\n```",
