    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    ```

    While this is also $O(length(S))$, it requires no extra space and no recursive calls, consequently running faster in practice.

    ### Total length of all different substrings

    Given a string $S$.
    We want to compute the total length of all its various substrings.

    The solution is similar to the previous one, only now it is necessary to consider two quantities for the dynamic programming part:
    the number of different substrings $d[v]$ and their total length $ans[v]$.

    We already described how to compute $d[v]$ in the previous task.
    The value $ans[v]$ can be computed using the recursion:

    $$ans[v] = \sum_{w : (v, w, c) \in DAWG} d[w] + ans[w]$$

    We take the answer of each adjacent vertex $w$, and add to it $d[w]$ (since every substrings is one character longer when starting from the state $v$).

    Again this task can be computed in $O(length(S))$ time.

    Alternatively, we can, again, take advantage of the fact that each state $v$ matches to substrings of length $[minlen(v),len(v)]$.
    Since $minlen(v) = 1 + len(link(v))$ and the arithmetic series formula $S_n = n \cdot \frac{a_1+a_n}{2}$ (where $S_n$ denotes the sum of $n$ terms, $a_1$ representing the first term, and $a_n$ representing the last), we can compute the length of substrings at a state in constant time.  We then sum up these totals for each state $v \neq t_0$ in the automaton. This is shown by the code below:

    ```cpp
    long long get_tot_len_diff_substings() {
        long long tot = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < sz; i++) {
            long long shortest = st[st[i].link].len + 1;
            long long longest = st[i].len;
        
            long long num_strings = longest - shortest + 1;
            long long cur = num_strings * (longest + shortest) / 2;
            tot += cur;
        }
        return tot;
    }

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 2/4
    ```

    This is an **online** algorithm, i.e. it processes the data as it arrives - for example, you can read the string characters one by one and process them immediately, finding the value of prefix function for each next character.
    The algorithm still requires storing the string itself and the previously calculated values of prefix function, but if we know beforehand the maximum value $M$ the prefix function can take on the string, we can store only $M+1$ first characters of the string and the same number of values of the prefix function.

    ## Applications

    ### Search for a substring in a string. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm

    The task is the classical application of the prefix function.

    Given a text $t$ and a string $s$, we want to find and display the positions of all occurrences of the string $s$ in the text $t$.

    For convenience we denote with $n$ the length of the string s and with $m$ the length of the text $t$.

    We generate the string $s + \# + t$, where $\#$ is a separator that appears neither in $s$ nor in $t$.
    Let us calculate the prefix function for this string.
    Now think about the meaning of the values of the prefix function, except for the first $n + 1$ entries (which belong to the string $s$ and the separator).
    By definition the value $\pi[i]$ shows the longest length of a substring ending in position $i$ that coincides with the prefix.
    But in our case this is nothing more than the largest block that coincides with $s$ and ends at position $i$.
    This length cannot be bigger than $n$ due to the separator.
    But if equality $\pi[i] = n$ is achieved, then it means that the string $s$ appears completely in at this position, i.e. it ends at position $i$.
    Just do not forget that the positions are indexed in the string $s + \# + t$.

    Thus if at some position $i$ we have $\pi[i] = n$, then at the position $i - (n + 1) - n + 1 = i - 2n$ in the string $t$ the string $s$ appears.

    As already mentioned in the description of the prefix function computation, if we know that the prefix values never exceed a certain value, then we do not need to store the entire string and the entire function, but only its beginning.
    In our case this means that we only need to store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it.
    We can read one character at a time of the string $t$ and calculate the current value of the prefix function.

    Thus the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm solves the problem in $O(n + m)$ time and $O(n)$ memory.

    ### Counting the number of occurrences of each prefix

    Here we discuss two problems at once.
    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    In the first variation of the problem we want to count the number of appearances of each prefix $s[0 \dots i]$ in the same string.
    In the second variation of the problem another string $t$ is given and we want to count the number of appearances of each prefix $s[0 \dots i]$ in $t$.

    First we solve the first problem.
    Consider the value of the prefix function $\pi[i]$ at a position $i$.
    By definition it means that the prefix of length $\pi[i]$ of the string $s$ occurs and ends at position $i$, and there is no longer prefix that follows this definition.
    At the same time shorter prefixes can end at this position.
    It is not difficult to see, that we have the same question that we already answered when we computed the prefix function itself:
    Given a prefix of length $j$ that is a suffix ending at position $i$, what is the next smaller prefix $\lt j$ that is also a suffix ending at position $i$.
    Thus at the position $i$ ends the prefix of length $\pi[i]$, the prefix of length $\pi[\pi[i] - 1]$, the prefix $\pi[\pi[\pi[i] - 1] - 1]$, and so on, until the index becomes zero.
    Thus we can compute the answer in the following way.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_count_each_prefix}
    vector<int> ans(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        ans[pi[i]]++;
    for (int i = n-1; i > 0; i--)
        ans[pi[i-1]] += ans[i];
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
        ans[i]++;
