    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Minimizing sums
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.

    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 1/5
    # The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

    The inclusion-exclusion principle is an important combinatorial way to compute the size of a set or the probability of complex events. It relates the sizes of individual sets with their union.

    ## Statement

    ### The verbal formula

    The inclusion-exclusion principle can be expressed as follows:

    To compute the size of a union of multiple sets, it is necessary to sum the sizes of these sets **separately**, and then subtract the sizes of all **pairwise** intersections of the sets, then add back the size of the intersections of **triples** of the sets, subtract the size of **quadruples** of the sets, and so on, up to the intersection of **all** sets.

    ### The formulation in terms of sets

    The above definition can be expressed mathematically as follows:

    $$\left| \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{i=1}^n|A_i| - \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} |A_i \cap A_j| + \sum _{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}|A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} | A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n |$$

    And in a more compact way:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\Biggl |}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr |}$$

    ### The formulation using Venn diagrams

    Let the diagram show three sets $A$, $B$ and $C$:

    ![Venn diagram](venn-inclusion-exclusion.png "Venn diagram")

    Then the area of their union $A \cup B \cup C$ is equal to the sum of the areas $A$, $B$ and $C$ less double-covered areas $A \cap B$, $A \cap C$, $B \cap C$, but with the addition of the area covered by three sets $A \cap B \cap C$:

    $$S(A \cup B \cup C) = S(A) + S(B) + S(C) - S(A \cap B) - S(A \cap C) - S(B \cap C) + S(A \cap B \cap C)$$

    It can also be generalized for an association of $n$ sets.

    ### The formulation in terms of probability theory

    If $A_i$ $(i = 1,2...n)$ are events and ${\cal P}(A_i)$ the probability of an event from $A_i$ to occur, then the probability of their union (i.e. the probability that at least one of the events occur) is equal to:

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    {\cal P} \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right) &=& \sum_{i=1}^n{\cal P}(A_i)\ - \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} {\cal P}(A_i \cap A_j)\  + \\
    &+& \sum _{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}{\cal P}(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k) - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} {\cal P}( A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n )
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    And in a more compact way:

    $${\cal P} \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right) = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\ {\cal P}{\Biggl (}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr )}$$

    ## Proof

    For the proof it is convenient to use the mathematical formulation in terms of set theory:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\Biggl |}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr |}$$

    We want to prove that any element contained in at least one of the sets $A_i$ will occur in the formula only once (note that elements which are not present in any of the sets $A_i$ will never be considered on the right part of the formula).

    Consider an element $x$ occurring in $k \geq 1$ sets $A_i$. We will show it is counted only once in the formula. Note that:

    * in terms which $|J| = 1$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\ k$** times;
    * in terms which $|J| = 2$, the item $x$ will be counted **$-\ \binom{k}{2}$** times - because it will be counted in those terms that include two of the $k$ sets containing $x$;
    * in terms which $|J| = 3$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\ \binom{k}{3}$** times;
    * $\cdots$
    * in terms which $|J| = k$, the item $x$ will be counted **$(-1)^{k-1}\cdot \binom{k}{k}$** times;
    * in terms which $|J| \gt k$, the item $x$ will be counted **zero** times;

    This leads us to the following sum of [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ T = \binom{k}{1} - \binom{k}{2} + \binom{k}{3} - \cdots + (-1)^{i-1}\cdot \binom{k}{i} + \cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\cdot \binom{k}{k}$$

    This expression is very similar to the binomial expansion of $(1 - x)^k$:

    $$ (1 - x)^k = \binom{k}{0} - \binom{k}{1} \cdot x + \binom{k}{2} \cdot x^2 - \binom{k}{3} \cdot x^3 + \cdots + (-1)^k\cdot \binom{k}{k} \cdot x^k $$

    When $x = 1$, $(1 - x)^k$ looks a lot like $T$. However, the expression has an additional $\binom{k}{0} = 1$, and it is multiplied by $-1$. That leads us to $(1 - 1)^k = 1 - T$. Therefore $T = 1 - (1 - 1)^k = 1$, what was required to prove. The element is counted only once.

    ## Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly $r$ sets {data-toc-label="Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly r sets"}

    Inclusion-exclusion principle can be rewritten to calculate number of elements which are present in zero sets:

    $$\left|\bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A_i}\right|=\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \sum_{|X|=m} \left|\bigcap_{i\in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    Consider its generalization to calculate number of elements which are present in exactly $r$ sets:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{|B|=r}\left[\bigcap_{i \in B} A_i \cap \bigcap_{j \not\in B} \overline{A_j}\right]\right|=\sum_{m=r}^n (-1)^{m-r}\dbinom{m}{r} \sum_{|X|=m} \left|\bigcap_{i \in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    To prove this formula, consider some particular $B$. Due to basic inclusion-exclusion principle we can say about it that:

    $$\left|\bigcap_{i \in B} A_i \cap \bigcap_{j \not \in B} \overline{A_j}\right|=\sum_{m=r}^{n} (-1)^{m-r} \sum_{\substack{|X|=m \newline B \subset X}}\left|\bigcap_{i\in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    The sets on the left side do not intersect for different $B$, thus we can sum them up directly. Also one should note that any set $X$ will always have coefficient $(-1)^{m-r}$ if it occurs and it will occur for exactly $\dbinom{m}{r}$ sets $B$. 

    ## Usage when solving problems

    The inclusion-exclusion principle is hard to understand without studying its applications.

    First, we will look at three simplest tasks "at paper", illustrating applications of the principle, and then consider more practical problems which are difficult to solve without inclusion-exclusion principle.

    Tasks asking to "find the **number** of ways" are worth of note, as they sometimes lead to polynomial solutions, not necessarily exponential.

    ### A simple task on permutations

    Task: count how many permutations of numbers from $0$ to $9$ exist such that the first element is greater than $1$ and the last one is less than $8$.

    Let's count the number of "bad" permutations, that is, permutations in which the first element is $\leq 1$ and/or the last is $\geq 8$.

    We will denote by $X$ the set of permutations in which the first element is $\leq 1$ and $Y$ the set of permutations in which the last element is $\geq 8$. Then the number of "bad" permutations, as on the inclusion-exclusion formula, will be:

    $$ |X \cup Y| = |X| + |Y| - |X \cap Y| $$

    After a simple combinatorial calculation, we will get to:

    $$ 2 \cdot 9! + 2 \cdot 9! - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 8! $$

    The only thing left is to subtract this number from the total of $10!$ to get the number of "good" permutations.

    ### A simple task on (0, 1, 2) sequences

    Task: count how many sequences of length $n$ exist consisting only of numbers $0,1,2$ such that each number occurs **at least once**.

    Again let us turn to the inverse problem, i.e. we calculate the number of sequences which do **not** contain **at least one** of the numbers.

    Let's denote by $A_i (i = 0,1,2)$ the set of sequences in which the digit $i$ does **not** occur.
    The formula of inclusion-exclusion on the number of "bad" sequences will be:

    $$ |A_0 \cup A_1 \cup A_2| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_0 \cap A_1| - |A_0 \cap A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_2| + |A_0 \cap A_1 \cap A_2| $$

    * The size of each $A_i$ is $2^n$, as each sequence can only contain two of the digits.
    * The size of each pairwise intersection $A_i \cap A_j$  is equal to $1$, as there will be only one digit to build the sequence.
    * The size of the intersection of all three sets is equal to $0$, as there will be no digits to build the sequence.

    As we solved the inverse problem, we subtract it from the total of $3^n$ sequences:

    $$3^n - (3 \cdot 2^n - 3 \cdot 1 + 0)$$

    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Minimizing sums
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 1/5
    # The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

    The inclusion-exclusion principle is an important combinatorial way to compute the size of a set or the probability of complex events. It relates the sizes of individual sets with their union.

    ## Statement

    ### The verbal formula

    The inclusion-exclusion principle can be expressed as follows:

    To compute the size of a union of multiple sets, it is necessary to sum the sizes of these sets **separately**, and then subtract the sizes of all **pairwise** intersections of the sets, then add back the size of the intersections of **triples** of the sets, subtract the size of **quadruples** of the sets, and so on, up to the intersection of **all** sets.

    ### The formulation in terms of sets

    The above definition can be expressed mathematically as follows:

    $$\left| \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{i=1}^n|A_i| - \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} |A_i \cap A_j| + \sum _{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}|A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} | A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n |$$

    And in a more compact way:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\Biggl |}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr |}$$

    ### The formulation using Venn diagrams

    Let the diagram show three sets $A$, $B$ and $C$:

    ![Venn diagram](venn-inclusion-exclusion.png "Venn diagram")

    Then the area of their union $A \cup B \cup C$ is equal to the sum of the areas $A$, $B$ and $C$ less double-covered areas $A \cap B$, $A \cap C$, $B \cap C$, but with the addition of the area covered by three sets $A \cap B \cap C$:

    $$S(A \cup B \cup C) = S(A) + S(B) + S(C) - S(A \cap B) - S(A \cap C) - S(B \cap C) + S(A \cap B \cap C)$$

    It can also be generalized for an association of $n$ sets.

    ### The formulation in terms of probability theory

    If $A_i$ $(i = 1,2...n)$ are events and ${\cal P}(A_i)$ the probability of an event from $A_i$ to occur, then the probability of their union (i.e. the probability that at least one of the events occur) is equal to:

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    {\cal P} \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right) &=& \sum_{i=1}^n{\cal P}(A_i)\ - \sum_{1\leq i<j\leq n} {\cal P}(A_i \cap A_j)\  + \\
    &+& \sum _{1\leq i<j<k\leq n}{\cal P}(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k) - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} {\cal P}( A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n )
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    And in a more compact way:

    $${\cal P} \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right) = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\ {\cal P}{\Biggl (}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr )}$$

    ## Proof

    For the proof it is convenient to use the mathematical formulation in terms of set theory:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \right| = \sum_{\emptyset \neq J\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\Biggl |}\bigcap_{j\in J}A_{j}{\Biggr |}$$

    We want to prove that any element contained in at least one of the sets $A_i$ will occur in the formula only once (note that elements which are not present in any of the sets $A_i$ will never be considered on the right part of the formula).

    Consider an element $x$ occurring in $k \geq 1$ sets $A_i$. We will show it is counted only once in the formula. Note that:

    * in terms which $|J| = 1$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\ k$** times;
    * in terms which $|J| = 2$, the item $x$ will be counted **$-\ \binom{k}{2}$** times - because it will be counted in those terms that include two of the $k$ sets containing $x$;
    * in terms which $|J| = 3$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\ \binom{k}{3}$** times;
    * $\cdots$
    * in terms which $|J| = k$, the item $x$ will be counted **$(-1)^{k-1}\cdot \binom{k}{k}$** times;
    * in terms which $|J| \gt k$, the item $x$ will be counted **zero** times;

    This leads us to the following sum of [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ T = \binom{k}{1} - \binom{k}{2} + \binom{k}{3} - \cdots + (-1)^{i-1}\cdot \binom{k}{i} + \cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\cdot \binom{k}{k}$$

    This expression is very similar to the binomial expansion of $(1 - x)^k$:

    $$ (1 - x)^k = \binom{k}{0} - \binom{k}{1} \cdot x + \binom{k}{2} \cdot x^2 - \binom{k}{3} \cdot x^3 + \cdots + (-1)^k\cdot \binom{k}{k} \cdot x^k $$

    When $x = 1$, $(1 - x)^k$ looks a lot like $T$. However, the expression has an additional $\binom{k}{0} = 1$, and it is multiplied by $-1$. That leads us to $(1 - 1)^k = 1 - T$. Therefore $T = 1 - (1 - 1)^k = 1$, what was required to prove. The element is counted only once.

    ## Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly $r$ sets {data-toc-label="Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly r sets"}

    Inclusion-exclusion principle can be rewritten to calculate number of elements which are present in zero sets:

    $$\left|\bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A_i}\right|=\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \sum_{|X|=m} \left|\bigcap_{i\in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    Consider its generalization to calculate number of elements which are present in exactly $r$ sets:

    $$\left|\bigcup_{|B|=r}\left[\bigcap_{i \in B} A_i \cap \bigcap_{j \not\in B} \overline{A_j}\right]\right|=\sum_{m=r}^n (-1)^{m-r}\dbinom{m}{r} \sum_{|X|=m} \left|\bigcap_{i \in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    To prove this formula, consider some particular $B$. Due to basic inclusion-exclusion principle we can say about it that:

    $$\left|\bigcap_{i \in B} A_i \cap \bigcap_{j \not \in B} \overline{A_j}\right|=\sum_{m=r}^{n} (-1)^{m-r} \sum_{\substack{|X|=m \newline B \subset X}}\left|\bigcap_{i\in X} A_{i}\right|$$

    The sets on the left side do not intersect for different $B$, thus we can sum them up directly. Also one should note that any set $X$ will always have coefficient $(-1)^{m-r}$ if it occurs and it will occur for exactly $\dbinom{m}{r}$ sets $B$. 

    ## Usage when solving problems

    The inclusion-exclusion principle is hard to understand without studying its applications.

    First, we will look at three simplest tasks "at paper", illustrating applications of the principle, and then consider more practical problems which are difficult to solve without inclusion-exclusion principle.

    Tasks asking to "find the **number** of ways" are worth of note, as they sometimes lead to polynomial solutions, not necessarily exponential.

    ### A simple task on permutations

    Task: count how many permutations of numbers from $0$ to $9$ exist such that the first element is greater than $1$ and the last one is less than $8$.

    Let's count the number of "bad" permutations, that is, permutations in which the first element is $\leq 1$ and/or the last is $\geq 8$.

    We will denote by $X$ the set of permutations in which the first element is $\leq 1$ and $Y$ the set of permutations in which the last element is $\geq 8$. Then the number of "bad" permutations, as on the inclusion-exclusion formula, will be:

    $$ |X \cup Y| = |X| + |Y| - |X \cap Y| $$

    After a simple combinatorial calculation, we will get to:

    $$ 2 \cdot 9! + 2 \cdot 9! - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 8! $$

    The only thing left is to subtract this number from the total of $10!$ to get the number of "good" permutations.

    ### A simple task on (0, 1, 2) sequences

    Task: count how many sequences of length $n$ exist consisting only of numbers $0,1,2$ such that each number occurs **at least once**.

    Again let us turn to the inverse problem, i.e. we calculate the number of sequences which do **not** contain **at least one** of the numbers.

    Let's denote by $A_i (i = 0,1,2)$ the set of sequences in which the digit $i$ does **not** occur.
    The formula of inclusion-exclusion on the number of "bad" sequences will be:

    $$ |A_0 \cup A_1 \cup A_2| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_0 \cap A_1| - |A_0 \cap A_2| - |A_1 \cap A_2| + |A_0 \cap A_1 \cap A_2| $$

    * The size of each $A_i$ is $2^n$, as each sequence can only contain two of the digits.
    * The size of each pairwise intersection $A_i \cap A_j$  is equal to $1$, as there will be only one digit to build the sequence.
    * The size of the intersection of all three sets is equal to $0$, as there will be no digits to build the sequence.

    As we solved the inverse problem, we subtract it from the total of $3^n$ sequences:

    $$3^n - (3 \cdot 2^n - 3 \cdot 1 + 0)$$
