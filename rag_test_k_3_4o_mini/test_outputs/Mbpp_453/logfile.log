INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/453 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of all even factors of a given number. For example, if the input is 18, the even factors are 2, 6, and 18, and their sum is 26.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the sum of even factors of a number, we can:
   - Loop through all numbers from 1 to the given number.
   - For each number, check if it is a factor of the given number (i.e., if the given number is divisible by this number).
   - If it is a factor and it is even, add it to a running total.
   - Finally, return the total sum of the even factors.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sumofFactors(n):
       initialize sum to 0
       for i from 1 to n:
           if n is divisible by i:
               if i is even:
                   add i to sum
       return sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def sumofFactors(n):
    # Initialize the sum of even factors to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if i is a factor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # Check if the factor is even
            if i % 2 == 0:
                # Add the even factor to the total sum
                total_sum += i
                
    # Return the total sum of even factors
    return total_sum
```

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. 

    \subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \subsubsection{Euler's totient function}

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }
