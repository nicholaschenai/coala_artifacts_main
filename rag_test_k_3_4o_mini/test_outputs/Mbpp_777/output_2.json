    "raw_msg": "Given the previous discussions and the insights gained, it seems that the original implementation of the function `find_sum` is correct in terms of logic for summing non-repeated elements. However, the expected output of `21` for the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]` is incorrect based on the definition of non-repeated elements.\n\nTo clarify, the unique elements in the list are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which sum to `20`. Therefore, the function should return `20`, and the test case expecting `21` is likely erroneous.\n\nHowever, to ensure that the function is robust and correctly identifies non-repeated elements, I will present the same code again, ensuring clarity and correctness in the implementation.\n\nHere is the final Python code:\n\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element\n    count_dict = {}\n    for num in lst:\n        if num in count_dict:\n            count_dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[num] = 1\n    return count_dict\n\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    # Count occurrences of each element in the list\n    count_dict = count_occurrences(lst)\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Sum only the elements that appear exactly once\n    for num, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count == 1:\n            total_sum += num\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis code will correctly return `20` for the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the sum of the non-repeated elements. If the environment still expects `21`, it may be necessary to review the test case or the problem statement for any discrepancies.",
