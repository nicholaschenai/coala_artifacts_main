    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the sum of all unique (non-repeated) elements in a given list of integers. If an integer appears more than once in the list, it should not be included in the sum.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the list. After counting, we can iterate through the dictionary and sum only those elements that appear exactly once.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_sum(list):\n       create an empty dictionary to count occurrences\n       for each element in the list:\n           if element is in the dictionary:\n               increment its count\n           else:\n               set its count to 1\n       initialize sum to 0\n       for each key in the dictionary:\n           if the count of the key is 1:\n               add the key to sum\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element\n    count_dict = {}\n    for num in lst:\n        if num in count_dict:\n            count_dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[num] = 1\n    return count_dict\n\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    # Count occurrences of each element in the list\n    count_dict = count_occurrences(lst)\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Sum only the elements that appear exactly once\n    for num, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count == 1:\n            total_sum += num\n    return total_sum\n```",
