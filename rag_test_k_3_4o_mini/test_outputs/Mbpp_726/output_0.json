    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple. The new tuple should contain products of adjacent elements from the original tuple. For example, if the input is (1, 5, 7, 8, 10), the output should be (5, 35, 56, 80), which corresponds to multiplying 1 and 5, 5 and 7, 7 and 8, and 8 and 10.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the input tuple, multiplying each element by the next one. We will store these products in a new list and then convert that list into a tuple before returning it. The length of the output tuple will be one less than the input tuple since we are pairing adjacent elements.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function multiply_elements(t):\n       create an empty list result\n       for i from 0 to length of t - 2:\n           product = t[i] * t[i + 1]\n           append product to result\n       return tuple of result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef multiply_elements(t):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the tuple, multiplying each element by the next\n    for i in range(len(t) - 1):\n        product = t[i] * t[i + 1]  # Multiply the current element by the next\n        result.append(product)       # Append the product to the result list\n    \n    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n\n```",
