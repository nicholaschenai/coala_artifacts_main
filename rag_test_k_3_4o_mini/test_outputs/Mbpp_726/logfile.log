INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/726 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple. The new tuple should contain products of adjacent elements from the input tuple. Specifically, for each element in the input tuple (except the last one), we will multiply it by the next element.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through the input tuple, taking each element and multiplying it by the next element.
   - We will store these products in a new tuple.
   - Finally, we will return the new tuple containing the products.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function multiply_elements(input_tuple):
       create an empty list to store products
       for i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:
           product = input_tuple[i] * input_tuple[i + 1]
           append product to the list
       convert the list to a tuple
       return the tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def multiply_elements(input_tuple):
    # Create an empty list to store products
    products = []
    
    # Iterate through the input tuple up to the second last element
    for i in range(len(input_tuple) - 1):
        # Calculate the product of the current element and the next element
        product = input_tuple[i] * input_tuple[i + 1]
        # Append the product to the list
        products.append(product)
    
    # Convert the list of products to a tuple
    return tuple(products)

    ```

        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\frac{x+y \sqrt{n}}{z}$.

    !!! example "[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)"
        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            x, k = map(int, input().split())

            mod = 10**9+7
        
            # compose (A[0]*x + A[1]) / (A[2]*x + A[3]) and (B[0]*x + B[1]) / (B[2]*x + B[3])
            def combine(A, B):
                return [t % mod for t in [A[0]*B[0]+A[1]*B[2], A[0]*B[1]+A[1]*B[3], A[2]*B[0]+A[3]*B[2], A[2]*B[1]+A[3]*B[3]]]

            A = [1, 0, 0, 1] # (x + 0) / (0*x + 1) = x

            a = sqrt(x)

            T = len(a) - 1 # period of a

            # apply ak + 1/x = (ak*x+1)/(1x+0) to (Ax + B) / (Cx + D)
            for i in reversed(range(1, len(a))):
                A = combine([a[i], 1, 1, 0], A)

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/726 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple. The new tuple should contain products of adjacent elements from the original tuple. For example, if the input is (1, 5, 7, 8, 10), the output should be (5, 35, 56, 80), which corresponds to multiplying 1 and 5, 5 and 7, 7 and 8, and 8 and 10.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the input tuple, multiplying each element by the next one. We will store these products in a new list and then convert that list into a tuple before returning it. The length of the output tuple will be one less than the input tuple since we are pairing adjacent elements.
