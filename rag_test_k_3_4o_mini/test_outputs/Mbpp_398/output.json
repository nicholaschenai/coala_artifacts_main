    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes a list of integers and computes the sum of the digits of each integer in that list. The final output should be the total sum of all these digits.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each number in the list, convert each number to its string representation to access its digits, convert each digit back to an integer, and then sum these integers. Finally, we will return the total sum of all digits from all numbers in the list.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum_of_digits(numbers):\n       initialize total_sum to 0\n       for each number in numbers:\n           convert number to string\n           for each character in string:\n               convert character to integer\n               add integer to total_sum\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(numbers):\n    total_sum = 0  # Initialize total sum to 0\n    for number in numbers:  # Iterate through each number in the list\n        for digit in str(number):  # Convert number to string and iterate through each character\n            total_sum += int(digit)  # Convert character back to integer and add to total sum\n    return total_sum  # Return the total sum of digits\n```",
