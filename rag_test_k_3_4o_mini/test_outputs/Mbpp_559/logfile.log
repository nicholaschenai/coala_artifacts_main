INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/559 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and finds the sum of the largest contiguous sublist within that list. A contiguous sublist is a sequence of elements that are next to each other in the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a technique called Kadane's Algorithm. The idea is to iterate through the list while keeping track of two values: the maximum sum of the sublist found so far and the current sum of the sublist we are evaluating. If the current sum becomes negative, we reset it to zero because starting a new sublist from the next element could yield a higher sum. We will update the maximum sum whenever the current sum exceeds it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):
       initialize max_sum to negative infinity
       initialize current_sum to 0
       
       for each number in arr:
           add number to current_sum
           if current_sum > max_sum:
               update max_sum to current_sum
           if current_sum < 0:
               reset current_sum to 0
       
       return max_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):
    # Initialize max_sum to a very small number
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    # Initialize current_sum to 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the array
    for number in arr:
        # Add the current number to current_sum
        current_sum += number
        
        # Update max_sum if current_sum is greater
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
        
        # If current_sum drops below 0, reset it to 0
        if current_sum < 0:
            current_sum = 0
            
    # Return the maximum sum found
    return max_sum

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 1/2
    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum

    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).

    ## Problem statement

    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:

    $$ \max_{ 1 \le l \le r \le n } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.
    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.

    ## Algorithm 1

    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm is very simple.

    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.

    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.

    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.

    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.

    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.

    ### Implementation

    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ — we will only need the current element from it.

    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.

    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);
        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);
    }
    ```

    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        int cur = sum - min_sum;
        if (cur > ans) {
            ans = cur;
            ans_l = min_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = sum;
            min_pos = r;
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Algorithm 2

    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.

    **Proof:**

    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum — so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.

    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.

    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a "critical" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.

    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.

    ### Implementation

    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum);
        sum = max(sum, 0);
    }
    ```

    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        if (sum > ans) {
            ans = sum;
            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < 0) {
            sum = 0;
            minus_pos = r;
        }
    }

    \index{maximum subarray sum}

    There are often several possible algorithms
    for solving a problem such that their
    time complexities are different.
    This section discusses a classic problem that
    has a straightforward $O(n^3)$ solution.
    However, by designing a better algorithm, it
    is possible to solve the problem in $O(n^2)$
    time and even in $O(n)$ time.

    Given an array of $n$ numbers,
    our task is to calculate the
    \key{maximum subarray sum}, i.e.,
    the largest possible sum of 
    a sequence of consecutive values
    in the array\footnote{J. Bentley's
    book \emph{Programming Pearls} \cite{ben86} made the problem popular.}.
    The problem is interesting when there may be
    negative values in the array.
    For example, in the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{samepage}
    the following subarray produces the maximum sum $10$:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (6,1);
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \end{samepage}

    We assume that an empty subarray is allowed,
    so the maximum subarray sum is always at least $0$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    A straightforward way to solve the problem
    is to go through all possible subarrays,
    calculate the sum of values in each subarray and maintain
    the maximum sum.
    The following code implements this algorithm:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int k = a; k <= b; k++) {
                sum += array[k];
            }
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The variables \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} fix the first and
    last index of the subarray,
    and the sum of values is calculated to the variable \texttt{sum}.
    The variable \texttt{best} contains the maximum sum found during the search.

    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^3)$,
    because it consists of three nested loops 
    that go through the input.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is easy to make Algorithm 1 more efficient
    by removing one loop from it.
    This is possible by calculating the sum at the same
    time when the right end of the subarray moves.
    The result is the following code:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            sum += array[b];
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this change, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Surprisingly, it is possible to solve the problem
    in $O(n)$ time\footnote{In \cite{ben86}, this linear-time algorithm
    is attributed to J. B. Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes
    called \index{Kadane's algorithm} \key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means
    that just one loop is enough.
    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,
    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.
    After this, the answer for the problem is the
    maximum of those sums.

    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray
    that ends at position $k$.
    There are two possibilities:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.
    \item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends
    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.
    \end{enumerate}

    In the latter case, since we want to
    find a subarray with maximum sum,
    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$
    should also have the maximum sum.
    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently
    by calculating the maximum subarray sum
    for each ending position from left to right.

    The following code implements the algorithm:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0, sum = 0;
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);
        best = max(best,sum);
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The algorithm only contains one loop
    that goes through the input,
    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.
    This is also the best possible time complexity,
    because any algorithm for the problem
    has to examine all array elements at least once.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    It is interesting to study how efficient 
    algorithms are in practice.
    The following table shows the running times
    of the above algorithms for different
    values of $n$ on a modern computer.

    In each test, the input was generated randomly.
    The time needed for reading the input was not
    measured.

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    array size $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^2$ & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^3$ & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^4$ & > $10.0$ s & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^5$ & > $10.0$ s & $5.3$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^6$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^7$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    The comparison shows that all algorithms
    are efficient when the input size is small,
    but larger inputs bring out remarkable
    differences in the running times of the algorithms.
    Algorithm 1 becomes slow
    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2
    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.
    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process
    even the largest inputs instantly.

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    ## Related tasks

    ### Finding the maximum/minimum subarray with constraints

    If the problem condition imposes additional restrictions on the required segment $[l, r]$ (for example, that the length $r-l+1$ of the segment must be within the specified limits), then the described algorithm is likely to be easily generalized to these cases — anyway, the problem will still be to find the minimum in the array $s[]$ with the specified additional restrictions.

    ### Two-dimensional case of the problem: search for maximum/minimum submatrix

    The problem described in this article is naturally generalized to large dimensions. For example, in a two-dimensional case, it turns into a search for such a submatrix $[l_1 \ldots r_1, l_2 \ldots r_2]$ of a given matrix, which has the maximum sum of numbers in it.

    Using the solution for the one-dimensional case, it is easy to obtain a solution in $O(n^3)$ for the two-dimensions case:
    we iterate over all possible values of $l_1$ and $r_1$, and calculate the sums from $l_1$ to $r_1$ in each row of the matrix. Now we have the one-dimensional problem of finding the indices $l_2$ and $r_2$ in this array, which can already be solved in linear time.

    **Faster** algorithms for solving this problem are known, but they are not much faster than $O(n^3)$, and are very complex (so complex that many of them are inferior to the trivial algorithm for all reasonable constraints by the hidden constant). Currently, the best known algorithm works in $O\left(n^3 \frac{ \log^3 \log n }{ \log^2 n} \right)$ time (T. Chan 2007 "More algorithms for all-pairs shortest paths in weighted graphs")

    This algorithm by Chan, as well as many other results in this area, actually describe **fast matrix multiplication** (where matrix multiplication means modified multiplication: minimum is used instead of addition, and addition is used instead of multiplication). The problem of finding the submatrix with the largest sum can be reduced to the problem of finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, and this problem, in turn, can be reduced to such a multiplication of matrices.

    ### Search for a subarray with a maximum/minimum average

    This problem lies in finding such a segment $a[l, r]$, such that the average value is maximal:

    $$ \max_{l \le r} \frac{ 1 }{ r-l+1 } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    Of course, if no other conditions are imposed on the required segment $[l, r]$, then the solution will always be a segment of length $1$ at the maximum element of the array. 
    The problem only makes sense, if there are additional restrictions (for example, the length of the desired segment is bounded below).

    In this case, we apply the **standard technique** when working with the problems of the average value: we will select the desired maximum average value by **binary search**.

    To do this, we need to learn how to solve the following subproblem: given the number $x$, and we need to check whether there is a subarray of array $a[]$ (of course, satisfying all additional constraints of the problem), where the average value is greater than $x$.

    To solve this subproblem, subtract $x$ from each element of array $a[]$. Then our subproblem actually turns into this one: whether or not there are positive sum subarrays in this array. And we already know how to solve this problem.

    Thus, we obtained the solution for the asymptotic $O(T(n) \log W)$, where $W$ is the required accuracy, $T(n)$ is the time of solving the subtask for an array of length $n$ (which may vary depending on the specific additional restrictions imposed).

    ### Solving the online problem

    The condition of the problem is as follows: given an array of $n$ numbers, and a number $L$. There are queries of the form $(l,r)$, and in response to each query, it is required to find a subarray of the segment $[l, r]$ of length not less than $L$ with the maximum possible arithmetic mean.

    The algorithm for solving this problem is quite complex. KADR (Yaroslav Tverdokhleb) described his algorithm on the [Russian forum](http://e-maxx.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?id=410).

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/559 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and finds the sum of the largest contiguous sublist (subarray) within that list. The function should return this maximum sum.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use an efficient algorithm known as Kadane's algorithm. The idea is to iterate through the list while maintaining a running sum of the current subarray. If this running sum becomes negative, we reset it to zero because a negative sum would not contribute positively to any future subarray. Throughout the iteration, we keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function max_sub_array_sum(arr):
       max_sum = 0
       current_sum = 0
       
       for each number in arr:
           current_sum += number
           if current_sum > max_sum:
               max_sum = current_sum
           if current_sum < 0:

## Instructions

- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/559 [generation text] Let's analyze the feedback and identify the issues step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Error**: The error message indicates that the function `max_sub_array_sum()` is being called with two arguments, but it is defined to take only one argument. The assertion in the problem statement shows that the function is expected to take two parameters: a list and an integer (the length of the list).

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: In my previous solution, I only defined the function to take one parameter (the list of integers). I did not account for the second parameter, which is the length of the list. The function signature should be `max_sub_array_sum(arr: List[int], n: int)` where `n` is the length of the list.

3. **Correcting the Function Signature**: I need to modify the function to accept two parameters. However, since the length of the list can be derived from the list itself, I can ignore the second parameter in the implementation. The function will still work correctly by just using the list.

4. **Revising the Implementation**: I will keep the logic of Kadane's algorithm intact but will adjust the function signature to accept the second parameter. I will also ensure that the function still operates correctly without using the second parameter.

Now, I will provide the corrected code with the appropriate function signature.

```python
def max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):
    # Initialize the maximum sum to 0
    max_sum = 0
    # Initialize the current sum to 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the array
    for number in arr:
        # Add the current number to the current sum
        current_sum += number
        
        # Update max_sum if current_sum is greater
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
        
        # Reset current_sum to 0 if it becomes negative
        if current_sum < 0:
            current_sum = 0
    
    # Return the maximum sum found

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 1/2
    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum

    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).

    ## Problem statement

    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:

    $$ \max_{ 1 \le l \le r \le n } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.
    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.

    ## Algorithm 1

    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm is very simple.

    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.

    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.

    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.

    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.

    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.

    ### Implementation

    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ — we will only need the current element from it.

    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.

    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);
        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);
    }
    ```

    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        int cur = sum - min_sum;
        if (cur > ans) {
            ans = cur;
            ans_l = min_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = sum;
            min_pos = r;
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Algorithm 2

    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.

    **Proof:**

    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum — so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.

    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.

    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a "critical" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.

    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.

    ### Implementation

    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum);
        sum = max(sum, 0);
    }
    ```

    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        if (sum > ans) {
            ans = sum;
            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < 0) {
            sum = 0;
            minus_pos = r;
        }
    }

    \section{Maximum subarray sum}

    \index{maximum subarray sum}

    There are often several possible algorithms
    for solving a problem such that their
    time complexities are different.
    This section discusses a classic problem that
    has a straightforward $O(n^3)$ solution.
    However, by designing a better algorithm, it
    is possible to solve the problem in $O(n^2)$
    time and even in $O(n)$ time.

    Given an array of $n$ numbers,
    our task is to calculate the
    \key{maximum subarray sum}, i.e.,
    the largest possible sum of 
    a sequence of consecutive values
    in the array\footnote{J. Bentley's
    book \emph{Programming Pearls} \cite{ben86} made the problem popular.}.
    The problem is interesting when there may be
    negative values in the array.
    For example, in the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{samepage}
    the following subarray produces the maximum sum $10$:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (6,1);
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \end{samepage}

    We assume that an empty subarray is allowed,
    so the maximum subarray sum is always at least $0$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    A straightforward way to solve the problem
    is to go through all possible subarrays,
    calculate the sum of values in each subarray and maintain
    the maximum sum.
    The following code implements this algorithm:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int k = a; k <= b; k++) {
                sum += array[k];
            }
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The variables \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} fix the first and
    last index of the subarray,
    and the sum of values is calculated to the variable \texttt{sum}.
    The variable \texttt{best} contains the maximum sum found during the search.

    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^3)$,
    because it consists of three nested loops 
    that go through the input.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is easy to make Algorithm 1 more efficient
    by removing one loop from it.
    This is possible by calculating the sum at the same
    time when the right end of the subarray moves.
    The result is the following code:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            sum += array[b];
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this change, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Surprisingly, it is possible to solve the problem
    in $O(n)$ time\footnote{In \cite{ben86}, this linear-time algorithm
    is attributed to J. B. Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes
    called \index{Kadane's algorithm} \key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means
    that just one loop is enough.
    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,
    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.
    After this, the answer for the problem is the
    maximum of those sums.

    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray
    that ends at position $k$.
    There are two possibilities:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.
    \item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends
    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.
    \end{enumerate}

    In the latter case, since we want to
    find a subarray with maximum sum,
    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$
    should also have the maximum sum.
    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently
    by calculating the maximum subarray sum
    for each ending position from left to right.

    The following code implements the algorithm:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0, sum = 0;
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);
        best = max(best,sum);
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The algorithm only contains one loop
    that goes through the input,
    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.
    This is also the best possible time complexity,
    because any algorithm for the problem
    has to examine all array elements at least once.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    It is interesting to study how efficient 
    algorithms are in practice.
    The following table shows the running times
    of the above algorithms for different
    values of $n$ on a modern computer.

    In each test, the input was generated randomly.
    The time needed for reading the input was not
    measured.

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    array size $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^2$ & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^3$ & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^4$ & > $10.0$ s & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^5$ & > $10.0$ s & $5.3$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^6$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^7$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    The comparison shows that all algorithms
    are efficient when the input size is small,
    but larger inputs bring out remarkable
    differences in the running times of the algorithms.
    Algorithm 1 becomes slow
    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2
    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.
    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process
    even the largest inputs instantly.

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    ## Related tasks

    ### Finding the maximum/minimum subarray with constraints

    If the problem condition imposes additional restrictions on the required segment $[l, r]$ (for example, that the length $r-l+1$ of the segment must be within the specified limits), then the described algorithm is likely to be easily generalized to these cases — anyway, the problem will still be to find the minimum in the array $s[]$ with the specified additional restrictions.

    ### Two-dimensional case of the problem: search for maximum/minimum submatrix

    The problem described in this article is naturally generalized to large dimensions. For example, in a two-dimensional case, it turns into a search for such a submatrix $[l_1 \ldots r_1, l_2 \ldots r_2]$ of a given matrix, which has the maximum sum of numbers in it.

    Using the solution for the one-dimensional case, it is easy to obtain a solution in $O(n^3)$ for the two-dimensions case:
    we iterate over all possible values of $l_1$ and $r_1$, and calculate the sums from $l_1$ to $r_1$ in each row of the matrix. Now we have the one-dimensional problem of finding the indices $l_2$ and $r_2$ in this array, which can already be solved in linear time.

    **Faster** algorithms for solving this problem are known, but they are not much faster than $O(n^3)$, and are very complex (so complex that many of them are inferior to the trivial algorithm for all reasonable constraints by the hidden constant). Currently, the best known algorithm works in $O\left(n^3 \frac{ \log^3 \log n }{ \log^2 n} \right)$ time (T. Chan 2007 "More algorithms for all-pairs shortest paths in weighted graphs")

    This algorithm by Chan, as well as many other results in this area, actually describe **fast matrix multiplication** (where matrix multiplication means modified multiplication: minimum is used instead of addition, and addition is used instead of multiplication). The problem of finding the submatrix with the largest sum can be reduced to the problem of finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, and this problem, in turn, can be reduced to such a multiplication of matrices.

    ### Search for a subarray with a maximum/minimum average

    This problem lies in finding such a segment $a[l, r]$, such that the average value is maximal:

    $$ \max_{l \le r} \frac{ 1 }{ r-l+1 } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    Of course, if no other conditions are imposed on the required segment $[l, r]$, then the solution will always be a segment of length $1$ at the maximum element of the array. 
    The problem only makes sense, if there are additional restrictions (for example, the length of the desired segment is bounded below).

    In this case, we apply the **standard technique** when working with the problems of the average value: we will select the desired maximum average value by **binary search**.

    To do this, we need to learn how to solve the following subproblem: given the number $x$, and we need to check whether there is a subarray of array $a[]$ (of course, satisfying all additional constraints of the problem), where the average value is greater than $x$.

    To solve this subproblem, subtract $x$ from each element of array $a[]$. Then our subproblem actually turns into this one: whether or not there are positive sum subarrays in this array. And we already know how to solve this problem.

    Thus, we obtained the solution for the asymptotic $O(T(n) \log W)$, where $W$ is the required accuracy, $T(n)$ is the time of solving the subtask for an array of length $n$ (which may vary depending on the specific additional restrictions imposed).

    ### Solving the online problem

    The condition of the problem is as follows: given an array of $n$ numbers, and a number $L$. There are queries of the form $(l,r)$, and in response to each query, it is required to find a subarray of the segment $[l, r]$ of length not less than $L$ with the maximum possible arithmetic mean.

    The algorithm for solving this problem is quite complex. KADR (Yaroslav Tverdokhleb) described his algorithm on the [Russian forum](http://e-maxx.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?id=410).
