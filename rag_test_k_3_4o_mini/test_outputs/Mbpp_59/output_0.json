    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the nth octagonal number. The octagonal numbers are a sequence of numbers that can be represented as the number of sides of an octagon. The formula for the nth octagonal number is given by the formula \\( P(n) = n(3n - 2) \\).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the nth octagonal number, we can use the formula mentioned above. We will take the input number \\( n \\), apply the formula \\( n(3n - 2) \\), and return the result. This approach is straightforward and efficient since it involves basic arithmetic operations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_octagonal(n):\n       return n * (3 * n - 2)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the nth octagonal number\ndef is_octagonal(n: int) -> int:\n    # The formula for the nth octagonal number is n * (3n - 2)\n    return n * (3 * n - 2)\n```",
