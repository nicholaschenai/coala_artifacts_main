    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: We need to create a Python function that calculates the sum of all common divisors of two given integers. For example, for the numbers 10 and 15, the common divisors are 1, 5, and 10, and their sum is 6.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   - First, we need to find the common divisors of the two numbers. \n   - To do this, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, as all common divisors will be divisors of the GCD.\n   - Once we have the GCD, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to the GCD and check which of these numbers divide the GCD evenly. \n   - We will sum all the numbers that are divisors of the GCD.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum(a, b):\n       gcd_value = gcd(a, b)  // Find the GCD of a and b\n       sum_of_divisors = 0\n       for i from 1 to gcd_value:\n           if gcd_value % i == 0:  // Check if i is a divisor of gcd_value\n               sum_of_divisors += i  // Add i to the sum\n       return sum_of_divisors  // Return the total sum of common divisors\n       \n   function gcd(a, b):\n       while b != 0:\n           a, b = b, a % b  // Update a and b using the Euclidean algorithm\n       return a  // Return the GCD\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b  # Update a and b using the Euclidean algorithm\n    return a  # Return the GCD\n\ndef sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    gcd_value = gcd(a, b)  # Find the GCD of a and b\n    sum_of_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, gcd_value + 1):  # Iterate from 1 to gcd_value\n        if gcd_value % i == 0:  # Check if i is a divisor of gcd_value\n            sum_of_divisors += i  # Add i to the sum\n    return sum_of_divisors  # Return the total sum of common divisors\n```",
