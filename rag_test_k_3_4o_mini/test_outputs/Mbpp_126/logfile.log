INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/126 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two integers as input and calculates the sum of all the common divisors of these two numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the common divisors of two numbers, we can:
   - Identify the smaller of the two numbers, as any common divisor must be less than or equal to this smaller number.
   - Loop through all integers from 1 to the smaller number and check if each integer divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
   - If it does, we add that integer to a running total.
   - Finally, we return the total sum of these common divisors.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sum(a, b):
       min_value = minimum of a and b
       total_sum = 0
       for i from 1 to min_value:
           if a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
               total_sum += i
       return total_sum

    Title: Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor
    Part: 1/1
    # Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor

    Given two non-negative integers $a$ and $b$, we have to find their **GCD** (greatest common divisor), i.e. the largest number which is a divisor of both $a$ and $b$.
    It's commonly denoted by $\gcd(a, b)$. Mathematically it is defined as:

    $$\gcd(a, b) = \max \{k > 0 : (k \mid a) \text{ and } (k \mid b) \}$$

    (here the symbol "$\mid$" denotes divisibility, i.e. "$k \mid a$" means "$k$ divides $a$")

    When one of the numbers is zero, while the other is non-zero, their greatest common divisor, by definition, is the second number. When both numbers are zero, their greatest common divisor is undefined (it can be any arbitrarily large number), but it is convenient to define it as zero as well to preserve the associativity of $\gcd$. Which gives us a simple rule: if one of the numbers is zero, the greatest common divisor is the other number.

    The Euclidean algorithm, discussed below, allows to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers $a$ and $b$ in $O(\log \min(a, b))$.

    The algorithm was first described in Euclid's "Elements" (circa 300 BC), but it is possible that the algorithm has even earlier origins.

    ## Algorithm

    Originally, the Euclidean algorithm was formulated as follows: subtract the smaller number from the larger one until one of the numbers is zero. Indeed, if $g$ divides $a$ and $b$, it also divides $a-b$. On the other hand, if $g$ divides $a-b$ and $b$, then it also divides $a = b + (a-b)$, which means that the sets of the common divisors of $\{a, b\}$ and $\{b,a-b\}$ coincide.

    Note that $a$ remains the larger number until $b$ is subtracted from it at least $\left\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\right\rfloor$ times. Therefore, to speed things up, $a-b$ is substituted with $a-\left\lfloor\frac{a}{b}\right\rfloor b = a \bmod b$. Then the algorithm is formulated in an extremely simple way:

    $$\gcd(a, b) = \begin{cases}a,&\text{if }b = 0 \\ \gcd(b, a \bmod b),&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$

    ## Implementation

    ```cpp
    int gcd (int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0)
            return a;
        else
            return gcd (b, a % b);
    }
    ```

    Using the ternary operator in C++, we can write it as a one-liner.

    ```cpp
    int gcd (int a, int b) {
        return b ? gcd (b, a % b) : a;
    }
    ```

    And finally, here is a non-recursive implementation:

    ```cpp
    int gcd (int a, int b) {
        while (b) {
            a %= b;
            swap(a, b);
        }
        return a;
    }
    ```

    Note that since C++17, `gcd` is implemented as a [standard function](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/gcd) in C++.

    ## Time Complexity

    The running time of the algorithm is estimated by Lamé's theorem, which establishes a surprising connection between the Euclidean algorithm and the Fibonacci sequence:

    If $a > b \geq 1$ and $b < F_n$ for some $n$, the Euclidean algorithm performs at most $n-2$ recursive calls.

    Moreover, it is possible to show that the upper bound of this theorem is optimal. When $a = F_n$ and $b = F_{n-1}$, $gcd(a, b)$ will perform exactly $n-2$ recursive calls. In other words, consecutive Fibonacci numbers are the worst case input for Euclid's algorithm.

    Given that Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, we get that the Euclidean algorithm works in $O(\log \min(a, b))$.

    Another way to estimate the complexity is to notice that $a \bmod b$ for the case $a \geq b$ is at least $2$ times smaller than $a$, so the larger number is reduced at least in half on each iteration of the algorithm.

    ## Least common multiple

    Calculating the least common multiple (commonly denoted **LCM**) can be reduced to calculating the GCD with the following simple formula:

    $$\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\gcd(a, b)}$$

    Thus, LCM can be calculated using the Euclidean algorithm with the same time complexity:

    A possible implementation, that cleverly avoids integer overflows by first dividing $a$ with the GCD, is given here:

    ```cpp
    int lcm (int a, int b) {
        return a / gcd(a, b) * b;
    }
    ```

    ## Binary GCD

    The Binary GCD algorithm is an optimization to the normal Euclidean algorithm.

    The slow part of the normal algorithm are the modulo operations. Modulo operations, although we see them as $O(1)$, are a lot slower than simpler operations like addition, subtraction or bitwise operations.
    So it would be better to avoid those.

    It turns out, that you can design a fast GCD algorithm that avoids modulo operations.
    It's based on a few properties:

      - If both numbers are even, then we can factor out a two of both and compute the GCD of the remaining numbers: $\gcd(2a, 2b) = 2 \gcd(a, b)$.
      - If one of the numbers is even and the other one is odd, then we can remove the factor 2 from the even one: $\gcd(2a, b) = \gcd(a, b)$ if $b$ is odd.
      - If both numbers are odd, then subtracting one number of the other one will not change the GCD: $\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a-b)$

    Using only these properties, and some fast bitwise functions from GCC, we can implement a fast version:

    ```cpp
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (!a || !b)
            return a | b;
        unsigned shift = __builtin_ctz(a | b);
        a >>= __builtin_ctz(a);
        do {
            b >>= __builtin_ctz(b);
            if (a > b)
                swap(a, b);
            b -= a;
        } while (b);
        return a << shift;
    }
    ```

    Notice, that such an optimization is usually not necessary, and most programming languages already have a GCD function in their standard libraries.
    E.g. C++17 has such a function `std::gcd` in the `numeric` header.

    Title: Linear Diophantine Equation
    Part: 1/2
    # Linear Diophantine Equation

    A Linear Diophantine Equation (in two variables) is an equation of the general form:

    $$ax + by = c$$

    where $a$, $b$, $c$ are given integers, and $x$, $y$ are unknown integers.

    In this article, we consider several classical problems on these equations:

    * finding one solution
    * finding all solutions
    * finding the number of solutions and the solutions themselves in a given interval
    * finding a solution with minimum value of $x + y$

    ## The degenerate case

    A degenerate case that need to be taken care of is when $a = b = 0$. It is easy to see that we either have no solutions or infinitely many solutions, depending on whether $c = 0$ or not. In the rest of this article, we will ignore this case.

    ## Analytic solution

    When $a \neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$, the equation $ax+by=c$ can be equivalently treated as either of the following:

    \begin{gather}
    ax \equiv c \pmod b,\newline
    by \equiv c \pmod a.
    \end{gather}

    Without loss of generality, assume that $b \neq 0$ and consider the first equation. When $a$ and $b$ are co-prime, the solution to it is given as

    $$x \equiv ca^{-1} \pmod b,$$

    where $a^{-1}$ is the [modular inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$ modulo $b$.

    When $a$ and $b$ are not co-prime, values of $ax$ modulo $b$ for all integer $x$ are divisible by $g=\gcd(a, b)$, so the solution only exists when $c$ is divisible by $g$. In this case, one of solutions can be found by reducing the equation by $g$:

    $$(a/g) x \equiv (c/g) \pmod{b/g}.$$

    By the definition of $g$, the numbers $a/g$ and $b/g$ are co-prime, so the solution is given explicitly as

    $$\begin{cases}
    x \equiv (c/g)(a/g)^{-1}\pmod{b/g},\\
    y = \frac{c-ax}{b}.
    \end{cases}$$

    ## Algorithmic solution

    To find one solution of the Diophantine equation with 2 unknowns, you can use the [Extended Euclidean algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md). First, assume that $a$ and $b$ are non-negative. When we apply Extended Euclidean algorithm for $a$ and $b$, we can find their greatest common divisor $g$ and 2 numbers $x_g$ and $y_g$ such that:

    $$a x_g + b y_g = g$$

    If $c$ is divisible by $g = \gcd(a, b)$, then the given Diophantine equation has a solution, otherwise it does not have any solution. The proof is straight-forward: a linear combination of two numbers is divisible by their common divisor.

    Now supposed that $c$ is divisible by $g$, then we have:

    $$a \cdot x_g \cdot \frac{c}{g} + b \cdot y_g \cdot \frac{c}{g} = c$$

    Therefore one of the solutions of the Diophantine equation is:

    $$x_0 = x_g \cdot \frac{c}{g},$$

    $$y_0 = y_g \cdot \frac{c}{g}.$$

    The above idea still works when $a$ or $b$ or both of them are negative. We only need to change the sign of $x_0$ and $y_0$ when necessary.

    Finally, we can implement this idea as follows (note that this code does not consider the case $a = b = 0$):

    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_any}
    int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {
        if (b == 0) {
            x = 1;
            y = 0;
            return a;
        }
        int x1, y1;
        int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);
        x = y1;
        y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);
        return d;
    }

    bool find_any_solution(int a, int b, int c, int &x0, int &y0, int &g) {
        g = gcd(abs(a), abs(b), x0, y0);
        if (c % g) {
            return false;
        }

        x0 *= c / g;
        y0 *= c / g;
        if (a < 0) x0 = -x0;
        if (b < 0) y0 = -y0;
        return true;
    }
    ```

    ## Getting all solutions

    From one solution $(x_0, y_0)$, we can obtain all the solutions of the given equation.

    Let $g = \gcd(a, b)$ and let $x_0, y_0$ be integers which satisfy the following:

    $$a \cdot x_0 + b \cdot y_0 = c$$

    Now, we should see that adding $b / g$ to $x_0$, and, at the same time subtracting $a / g$ from $y_0$ will not break the equality:

    $$a \cdot \left(x_0 + \frac{b}{g}\right) + b \cdot \left(y_0 - \frac{a}{g}\right) = a \cdot x_0 + b \cdot y_0 + a \cdot \frac{b}{g} - b \cdot \frac{a}{g} = c$$

    Obviously, this process can be repeated again, so all the numbers of the form:

    $$x = x_0 + k \cdot \frac{b}{g}$$

    $$y = y_0 - k \cdot \frac{a}{g}$$

    are solutions of the given Diophantine equation.

    Moreover, this is the set of all possible solutions of the given Diophantine equation.

    ## Finding the number of solutions and the solutions in a given interval

    From previous section, it should be clear that if we don't impose any restrictions on the solutions, there would be infinite number of them. So in this section, we add some restrictions on the interval of $x$ and $y$, and we will try to count and enumerate all the solutions.

    Let there be two intervals: $[min_x; max_x]$ and $[min_y; max_y]$ and let's say we only want to find the solutions in these two intervals.

    Note that if $a$ or $b$ is $0$, then the problem only has one solution. We don't consider this case here.

    First, we can find a solution which have minimum value of $x$, such that $x \ge min_x$. To do this, we first find any solution of the Diophantine equation. Then, we shift this solution to get $x \ge min_x$ (using what we know about the set of all solutions in previous section). This can be done in $O(1)$.
    Denote this minimum value of $x$ by $l_{x1}$.

    Similarly, we can find the maximum value of $x$ which satisfy $x \le max_x$. Denote this maximum value of $x$ by $r_{x1}$.

    Similarly, we can find the minimum value of $y$ $(y \ge min_y)$ and maximum values of $y$ $(y \le max_y)$. Denote the corresponding values of $x$ by $l_{x2}$ and $r_{x2}$.

    The final solution is all solutions with x in intersection of $[l_{x1}, r_{x1}]$ and $[l_{x2}, r_{x2}]$. Let denote this intersection by $[l_x, r_x]$.

    Following is the code implementing this idea.
    Notice that we divide $a$ and $b$ at the beginning by $g$.
    Since the equation $a x + b y = c$ is equivalent to the equation $\frac{a}{g} x + \frac{b}{g} y = \frac{c}{g}$, we can use this one instead and have $\gcd(\frac{a}{g}, \frac{b}{g}) = 1$, which simplifies the formulas.

    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_all}
    void shift_solution(int & x, int & y, int a, int b, int cnt) {
        x += cnt * b;
        y -= cnt * a;
    }

    int find_all_solutions(int a, int b, int c, int minx, int maxx, int miny, int maxy) {
        int x, y, g;
        if (!find_any_solution(a, b, c, x, y, g))
            return 0;
        a /= g;
        b /= g;

        int sign_a = a > 0 ? +1 : -1;
        int sign_b = b > 0 ? +1 : -1;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (minx - x) / b);
        if (x < minx)
            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_b);
        if (x > maxx)
            return 0;
        int lx1 = x;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (maxx - x) / b);
        if (x > maxx)
            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_b);
        int rx1 = x;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(miny - y) / a);
        if (y < miny)
            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_a);
        if (y > maxy)
            return 0;
        int lx2 = x;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(maxy - y) / a);

        int lx = max(lx1, lx2);
        int rx = min(rx1, rx2);

        if (lx > rx)

    \index{Diophantine equation}

    A \key{Diophantine equation}
    %\footnote{Diophantus of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician who lived in the 3th century.}
    is an equation of the form
    \[ ax + by = c, \]
    where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants
    and the values of $x$ and $y$ should be found.
    Each number in the equation has to be an integer.
    For example, one solution for the equation
    $5x+2y=11$ is $x=3$ and $y=-2$.

    \index{extended Euclid's algorithm}

    We can efficiently solve a Diophantine equation
    by using Euclid's algorithm.
    It turns out that we can extend Euclid's algorithm
    so that it will find numbers $x$ and $y$
    that satisfy the following equation:
    \[
    ax + by = \textrm{gcd}(a,b)
    \]

    A Diophantine equation can be solved if
    $c$ is divisible by
    $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)$,
    and otherwise it cannot be solved.

    As an example, let us find numbers $x$ and $y$
    that satisfy the following equation:
    \[
    39x + 15y = 12
    \]
    The equation can be solved, because
    $\textrm{gcd}(39,15)=3$ and $3 \mid 12$.
    When Euclid's algorithm calculates the
    greatest common divisor of 39 and 15,
    it produces the following sequence of function calls:
    \[
    \textrm{gcd}(39,15) = \textrm{gcd}(15,9)
    = \textrm{gcd}(9,6) = \textrm{gcd}(6,3)
    = \textrm{gcd}(3,0) = 3 \]
    This corresponds to the following equations:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    39 - 2 \cdot 15 & = & 9 \\
    15 - 1 \cdot 9 & = & 6 \\
    9 - 1 \cdot 6 & = & 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    Using these equations, we can derive
    \[
    39 \cdot 2 + 15 \cdot (-5) = 3
    \]
    and by multiplying this by 4, the result is
    \[
    39 \cdot 8 + 15 \cdot (-20) = 12,
    \]
    so a solution to the equation is
    $x=8$ and $y=-20$.

    A solution to a Diophantine equation is not unique,
    because we can form an infinite number of solutions
    if we know one solution.
    If a pair $(x,y)$ is a solution, then also all pairs
    \[(x+\frac{kb}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)},y-\frac{ka}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)})\]
    are solutions, where $k$ is any integer.

    \subsubsection{Chinese remainder theorem}

    \index{Chinese remainder theorem}

    The \key{Chinese remainder theorem} solves
    a group of equations of the form
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    x & = & a_1 \bmod m_1 \\
    x & = & a_2 \bmod m_2 \\
    \cdots \\
    x & = & a_n \bmod m_n \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    where all pairs of $m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_n$ are coprime.

    Let $x^{-1}_m$ be the inverse of $x$ modulo $m$, and
    \[ X_k = \frac{m_1 m_2 \cdots m_n}{m_k}.\]
    Using this notation, a solution to the equations is
    \[x = a_1 X_1 {X_1}^{-1}_{m_1} + a_2 X_2 {X_2}^{-1}_{m_2} + \cdots + a_n X_n {X_n}^{-1}_{m_n}.\]
    In this solution, for each $k=1,2,\ldots,n$,
    \[a_k X_k {X_k}^{-1}_{m_k} \bmod m_k = a_k,\]
    because
    \[X_k {X_k}^{-1}_{m_k} \bmod m_k = 1.\]
    Since all other terms in the sum are divisible by $m_k$,
    they have no effect on the remainder,
    and $x \bmod m_k = a_k$.

    For example, a solution for
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    x & = & 3 \bmod 5 \\
    x & = & 4 \bmod 7 \\
    x & = & 2 \bmod 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    is
    \[ 3 \cdot 21 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 15 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 35 \cdot 2 = 263.\]

    Once we have found a solution $x$,
    we can create an infinite number of other solutions,
    because all numbers of the form
    \[x+m_1 m_2 \cdots m_n\]
    are solutions.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/126 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: We need to create a Python function that calculates the sum of all common divisors of two given integers. For example, for the numbers 10 and 15, the common divisors are 1, 5, and 10, and their sum is 6.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: 
   - First, we need to find the common divisors of the two numbers. 
   - To do this, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, as all common divisors will be divisors of the GCD.
   - Once we have the GCD, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to the GCD and check which of these numbers divide the GCD evenly. 
   - We will sum all the numbers that are divisors of the GCD.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function sum(a, b):
       gcd_value = gcd(a, b)  // Find the GCD of a and b
       sum_of_divisors = 0
       for i from 1 to gcd_value:
           if gcd_value % i == 0:  // Check if i is a divisor of gcd_value
               sum_of_divisors += i  // Add i to the sum
       return sum_of_divisors  // Return the total sum of common divisors
       
   function gcd(a, b):
       while b != 0:
           a, b = b, a % b  // Update a and b using the Euclidean algorithm
       return a  // Return the GCD
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b  # Update a and b using the Euclidean algorithm
    return a  # Return the GCD

    sum_of_divisors = 0
    for i in range(1, gcd_value + 1):  # Iterate from 1 to gcd_value
        if gcd_value % i == 0:  # Check if i is a divisor of gcd_value
            sum_of_divisors += i  # Add i to the sum
