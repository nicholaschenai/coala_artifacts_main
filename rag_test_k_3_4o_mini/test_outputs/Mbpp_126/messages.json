Mathematically it is defined as:\n\n    $$\\gcd(a, b) = \\max \\{k > 0 : (k \\mid a) \\text{ and } (k \\mid b) \\}$$\n\n    (here the symbol \"$\\mid$\" denotes divisibility, i.e. \"$k \\mid a$\" means \"$k$ divides $a$\")\n\n    When one of the numbers is zero, while the other is non-zero, their greatest common divisor, by definition, is the second number. When both numbers are zero, their greatest common divisor is undefined (it can be any arbitrarily large number), but it is convenient to define it as zero as well to preserve the associativity of $\\gcd$. Which gives us a simple rule: if one of the numbers is zero, the greatest common divisor is the other number.\n\n    The Euclidean algorithm, discussed below, allows to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers $a$ and $b$ in $O(\\log \\min(a, b))$.\n\n    The algorithm was first described in Euclid's \"Elements\" (circa 300 BC), but it is possible that the algorithm has even earlier origins.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n\n    Originally, the Euclidean algorithm was formulated as follows: subtract the smaller number from the larger one until one of the numbers is zero. Indeed, if $g$ divides $a$ and $b$, it also divides $a-b$. On the other hand, if $g$ divides $a-b$ and $b$, then it also divides $a = b + (a-b)$, which means that the sets of the common divisors of $\\{a, b\\}$ and $\\{b,a-b\\}$ coincide.\n\n    Note that $a$ remains the larger number until $b$ is subtracted from it at least $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a}{b}\\right\\rfloor$ times. Therefore, to speed things up, $a-b$ is substituted with $a-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{a}{b}\\right\\rfloor b = a \\bmod b$. Then the algorithm is formulated in an extremely simple way:\n\n    $$\\gcd(a, b) = \\begin{cases}a,&\\text{if }b = 0 \\\\ \\gcd(b, a \\bmod b),&\\text{otherwise.}\\end{cases}$$\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n    int gcd (int a, int b) {\n        if (b == 0)\n            return a;\n        else\n            return gcd (b, a % b);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Using the ternary operator in C++, we can write it as a one-liner.\n\n    ```cpp\n    int gcd (int a, int b) {\n        return b ? gcd (b, a % b) : a;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    And finally, here is a non-recursive implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int gcd (int a, int b) {\n        while (b) {\n            a %= b;\n            swap(a, b);\n        }\n        return a;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Note that since C++17, `gcd` is implemented as a [standard function](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/gcd) in C++.\n\n    ## Time Complexity\n\n    The running time of the algorithm is estimated by Lam\u00e9's theorem, which establishes a surprising connection between the Euclidean algorithm and the Fibonacci sequence:\n\n    If $a > b \\geq 1$ and $b < F_n$ for some $n$, the Euclidean algorithm performs at most $n-2$ recursive calls.\n\n    Moreover, it is possible to show that the upper bound of this theorem is optimal. When $a = F_n$ and $b = F_{n-1}$, $gcd(a, b)$ will perform exactly $n-2$ recursive calls. In other words, consecutive Fibonacci numbers are the worst case input for Euclid's algorithm.\n\n    Given that Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, we get that the Euclidean algorithm works in $O(\\log \\min(a, b))$.\n\n    Another way to estimate the complexity is to notice that $a \\bmod b$ for the case $a \\geq b$ is at least $2$ times smaller than $a$, so the larger number is reduced at least in half on each iteration of the algorithm.\n\n    ## Least common multiple\n\n    Calculating the least common multiple (commonly denoted **LCM**) can be reduced to calculating the GCD with the following simple formula:\n\n    $$\\text{lcm}(a, b) = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\gcd(a, b)}$$\n\n    Thus, LCM can be calculated using the Euclidean algorithm with the same time complexity:\n\n    A possible implementation, that cleverly avoids integer overflows by first dividing $a$ with the GCD, is given here:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int lcm (int a, int b) {\n        return a / gcd(a, b) * b;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Binary GCD\n\n    The Binary GCD algorithm is an optimization to the normal Euclidean algorithm.\n\n    The slow part of the normal algorithm are the modulo operations. Modulo operations, although we see them as $O(1)$, are a lot slower than simpler operations like addition, subtraction or bitwise operations.\n    So it would be better to avoid those.\n\n    It turns out, that you can design a fast GCD algorithm that avoids modulo operations.\n    It's based on a few properties:\n\n      - If both numbers are even, then we can factor out a two of both and compute the GCD of the remaining numbers: $\\gcd(2a, 2b) = 2 \\gcd(a, b)$.\n      - If one of the numbers is even and the other one is odd, then we can remove the factor 2 from the even one: $\\gcd(2a, b) = \\gcd(a, b)$ if $b$ is odd.\n      - If both numbers are odd, then subtracting one number of the other one will not change the GCD: $\\gcd(a, b) = \\gcd(b, a-b)$\n\n    Using only these properties, and some fast bitwise functions from GCC, we can implement a fast version:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int gcd(int a, int b) {\n        if (!a || !b)\n            return a | b;\n        unsigned shift = __builtin_ctz(a | b);\n        a >>= __builtin_ctz(a);\n        do {\n            b >>= __builtin_ctz(b);\n            if (a > b)\n                swap(a, b);\n            b -= a;\n        } while (b);\n        return a << shift;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Notice, that such an optimization is usually not necessary, and most programming languages already have a GCD function in their standard libraries.\n    E.g. C++17 has such a function `std::gcd` in the `numeric` header.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Linear Diophantine Equation\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Linear Diophantine Equation\n\n    A Linear Diophantine Equation (in two variables) is an equation of the general form:\n\n    $$ax + by = c$$\n\n    where $a$, $b$, $c$ are given integers, and $x$, $y$ are unknown integers.\n\n    In this article, we consider several classical problems on these equations:\n\n    * finding one solution\n    * finding all solutions\n    * finding the number of solutions and the solutions themselves in a given interval\n    * finding a solution with minimum value of $x + y$\n\n    ## The degenerate case\n\n    A degenerate case that need to be taken care of is when $a = b = 0$. It is easy to see that we either have no solutions or infinitely many solutions, depending on whether $c = 0$ or not. In the rest of this article, we will ignore this case.\n\n    ## Analytic solution\n\n    When $a \\neq 0$ and $b \\neq 0$, the equation $ax+by=c$ can be equivalently treated as either of the following:\n\n    \\begin{gather}\n    ax \\equiv c \\pmod b,\\newline\n    by \\equiv c \\pmod a.\n    \\end{gather}\n\n    Without loss of generality, assume that $b \\neq 0$ and consider the first equation. When $a$ and $b$ are co-prime, the solution to it is given as\n\n    $$x \\equiv ca^{-1} \\pmod b,$$\n\n    where $a^{-1}$ is the [modular inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$ modulo $b$.\n\n    When $a$ and $b$ are not co-prime, values of $ax$ modulo $b$ for all integer $x$ are divisible by $g=\\gcd(a, b)$, so the solution only exists when $c$ is divisible by $g$. In this case, one of solutions can be found by reducing the equation by $g$:\n\n    $$(a/g) x \\equiv (c/g) \\pmod{b/g}.$$\n\n    By the definition of $g$, the numbers $a/g$ and $b/g$ are co-prime, so the solution is given explicitly as\n\n    $$\\begin{cases}\n    x \\equiv (c/g)(a/g)^{-1}\\pmod{b/g},\\\\\n    y = \\frac{c-ax}{b}.\n    \\end{cases}$$\n\n    ## Algorithmic solution\n\n    To find one solution of the Diophantine equation with 2 unknowns, you can use the [Extended Euclidean algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md). First, assume that $a$ and $b$ are non-negative. When we apply Extended Euclidean algorithm for $a$ and $b$, we can find their greatest common divisor $g$ and 2 numbers $x_g$ and $y_g$ such that:\n\n    $$a x_g + b y_g = g$$\n\n    If $c$ is divisible by $g = \\gcd(a, b)$, then the given Diophantine equation has a solution, otherwise it does not have any solution. The proof is straight-forward: a linear combination of two numbers is divisible by their common divisor.\n\n    Now supposed that $c$ is divisible by $g$, then we have:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g} + b \\cdot y_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g} = c$$\n\n    Therefore one of the solutions of the Diophantine equation is:\n\n    $$x_0 = x_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g},$$\n\n    $$y_0 = y_g \\cdot \\frac{c}{g}.$$\n\n    The above idea still works when $a$ or $b$ or both of them are negative. We only need to change the sign of $x_0$ and $y_0$ when necessary.\n\n    Finally, we can implement this idea as follows (note that this code does not consider the case $a = b = 0$):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_any}\n    int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {\n        if (b == 0) {\n            x = 1;\n            y = 0;\n            return a;\n        }\n        int x1, y1;\n        int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);\n        x = y1;\n        y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);\n        return d;\n    }\n\n    bool find_any_solution(int a, int b, int c, int &x0, int &y0, int &g) {\n        g = gcd(abs(a), abs(b), x0, y0);\n        if (c % g) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        x0 *= c / g;\n        y0 *= c / g;\n        if (a < 0) x0 = -x0;\n        if (b < 0) y0 = -y0;\n        return true;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Getting all solutions\n\n    From one solution $(x_0, y_0)$, we can obtain all the solutions of the given equation.\n\n    Let $g = \\gcd(a, b)$ and let $x_0, y_0$ be integers which satisfy the following:\n\n    $$a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot y_0 = c$$\n\n    Now, we should see that adding $b / g$ to $x_0$, and, at the same time subtracting $a / g$ from $y_0$ will not break the equality:\n\n    $$a \\cdot \\left(x_0 + \\frac{b}{g}\\right) + b \\cdot \\left(y_0 - \\frac{a}{g}\\right) = a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot y_0 + a \\cdot \\frac{b}{g} - b \\cdot \\frac{a}{g} = c$$\n\n    Obviously, this process can be repeated again, so all the numbers of the form:\n\n    $$x = x_0 + k \\cdot \\frac{b}{g}$$\n\n    $$y = y_0 - k \\cdot \\frac{a}{g}$$\n\n    are solutions of the given Diophantine equation.\n\n    Moreover, this is the set of all possible solutions of the given Diophantine equation.\n\n    ## Finding the number of solutions and the solutions in a given interval\n\n    From previous section, it should be clear that if we don't impose any restrictions on the solutions, there would be infinite number of them. So in this section, we add some restrictions on the interval of $x$ and $y$, and we will try to count and enumerate all the solutions.\n\n    Let there be two intervals: $[min_x; max_x]$ and $[min_y; max_y]$ and let's say we only want to find the solutions in these two intervals.\n\n    Note that if $a$ or $b$ is $0$, then the problem only has one solution. We don't consider this case here.\n\n    First, we can find a solution which have minimum value of $x$, such that $x \\ge min_x$. To do this, we first find any solution of the Diophantine equation. Then, we shift this solution to get $x \\ge min_x$ (using what we know about the set of all solutions in previous section). This can be done in $O(1)$.\n    Denote this minimum value of $x$ by $l_{x1}$.\n\n    Similarly, we can find the maximum value of $x$ which satisfy $x \\le max_x$. Denote this maximum value of $x$ by $r_{x1}$.\n\n    Similarly, we can find the minimum value of $y$ $(y \\ge min_y)$ and maximum values of $y$ $(y \\le max_y)$. Denote the corresponding values of $x$ by $l_{x2}$ and $r_{x2}$.\n\n    The final solution is all solutions with x in intersection of $[l_{x1}, r_{x1}]$ and $[l_{x2}, r_{x2}]$. Let denote this intersection by $[l_x, r_x]$.\n\n    Following is the code implementing this idea.\n    Notice that we divide $a$ and $b$ at the beginning by $g$.\n    Since the equation $a x + b y = c$ is equivalent to the equation $\\frac{a}{g} x + \\frac{b}{g} y = \\frac{c}{g}$, we can use this one instead and have $\\gcd(\\frac{a}{g}, \\frac{b}{g}) = 1$, which simplifies the formulas.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_all}\n    void shift_solution(int & x, int & y, int a, int b, int cnt) {\n        x += cnt * b;\n        y -= cnt * a;\n    }\n\n    int find_all_solutions(int a, int b, int c, int minx, int maxx, int miny, int maxy) {\n        int x, y, g;\n        if (!find_any_solution(a, b, c, x, y, g))\n            return 0;\n        a /= g;\n        b /= g;\n\n        int sign_a = a > 0 ?

For example, for the numbers 10 and 15, the common divisors are 1, 5, and 10, and their sum is 6.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   - First, we need to find the common divisors of the two numbers. \n   - To do this, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, as all common divisors will be divisors of the GCD.\n   - Once we have the GCD, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to the GCD and check which of these numbers divide the GCD evenly. \n   - We will sum all the numbers that are divisors of the GCD.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum(a, b):\n       gcd_value = gcd(a, b)  // Find the GCD of a and b\n       sum_of_divisors = 0\n       for i from 1 to gcd_value:\n           if gcd_value % i == 0:  // Check if i is a divisor of gcd_value\n               sum_of_divisors += i  // Add i to the sum\n       return sum_of_divisors  // Return the total sum of common divisors\n       \n   function gcd(a, b):\n       while b != 0:\n           a, b = b, a % b  // Update a and b using the Euclidean algorithm\n       return a  // Return the GCD\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b != 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b  # Update a and b using the Euclidean algorithm\n    return a  # Return the GCD\n\ndef sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    gcd_value = gcd(a, b)  # Find the GCD of a and b\n    sum_of_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, gcd_value + 1):  # Iterate from 1 to gcd_value\n        if gcd_value % i == 0:  # Check if i is a divisor of gcd_value\n            sum_of_divisors += i  # Add i to the sum\n    return sum_of_divisors  # Return the total sum of common divisors\n```"
