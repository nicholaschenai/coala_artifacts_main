    Title: Z-function and its calculation
    Part: 1/2
    # Z-function and its calculation

    Suppose we are given a string $s$ of length $n$. The **Z-function** for this string is an array of length $n$ where the $i$-th element is equal to the greatest number of characters starting from the position $i$ that coincide with the first characters of $s$.

    In other words, $z[i]$ is the length of the longest string that is, at the same time, a prefix of $s$ and a prefix of the suffix of $s$ starting at $i$.

    **Note.** In this article, to avoid ambiguity, we assume $0$-based indexes; that is: the first character of $s$ has index $0$ and the last one has index $n-1$.

    The first element of Z-function, $z[0]$, is generally not well defined. In this article we will assume it is zero (although it doesn't change anything in the algorithm implementation).

    This article presents an algorithm for calculating the Z-function in $O(n)$ time, as well as various of its applications.

    ## Examples

    For example, here are the values of the Z-function computed for different strings:

    * "aaaaa" - $[0, 4, 3, 2, 1]$
    * "aaabaab" - $[0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]$
    * "abacaba" - $[0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1]$

    ## Trivial algorithm

    Formal definition can be represented in the following elementary $O(n^2)$ implementation.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> z_function_trivial(string s) {
    	int n = s.size();
    	vector<int> z(n);
    	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    		while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {
    			z[i]++;
    		}
    	}
    	return z;
    }
    ```

    We just iterate through every position $i$ and update $z[i]$ for each one of them, starting from $z[i] = 0$ and incrementing it as long as we don't find a mismatch (and as long as we don't reach the end of the line).

    Of course, this is not an efficient implementation. We will now show the construction of an efficient implementation.

    ## Efficient algorithm to compute the Z-function

    To obtain an efficient algorithm we will compute the values of $z[i]$ in turn from $i = 1$ to $n - 1$ but at the same time, when computing a new value, we'll try to make the best use possible of the previously computed values.

    For the sake of brevity, let's call **segment matches** those substrings that coincide with a prefix of $s$. For example, the value of the desired Z-function $z[i]$ is the length of the segment match starting at position $i$ (and that ends at position $i + z[i] - 1$).

    To do this, we will keep **the $[l, r)$ indices of the rightmost segment match**. That is, among all detected segments we will keep the one that ends rightmost. In a way, the index $r$ can be seen as the "boundary" to which our string $s$ has been scanned by the algorithm; everything beyond that point is not yet known.

    Then, if the current index (for which we have to compute the next value of the Z-function) is $i$, we have one of two options:

    *   $i \geq r$ -- the current position is **outside** of what we have already processed.

        We will then compute $z[i]$ with the **trivial algorithm** (that is, just comparing values one by one). Note that in the end, if $z[i] > 0$, we'll have to update the indices of the rightmost segment, because it's guaranteed that the new $r = i + z[i]$ is better than the previous $r$.

    *   $i < r$ -- the current position is inside the current segment match $[l, r)$.

        Then we can use the already calculated Z-values to "initialize" the value of $z[i]$ to something (it sure is better than "starting from zero"), maybe even some big number.

        For this, we observe that the substrings $s[l \dots r)$ and $s[0 \dots r-l)$ **match**. This means that as an initial approximation for $z[i]$ we can take the value already computed for the corresponding segment $s[0 \dots r-l)$, and that is $z[i-l]$.

        However, the value $z[i-l]$ could be too large: when applied to position $i$ it could exceed the index $r$. This is not allowed because we know nothing about the characters to the right of $r$: they may differ from those required.

        Here is **an example** of a similar scenario:

        $$ s = "aaaabaa" $$

        When we get to the last position ($i = 6$), the current match segment will be $[5, 7)$. Position $6$ will then match position $6 - 5 = 1$, for which the value of the Z-function is $z[1] = 3$. Obviously, we cannot initialize $z[6]$ to $3$, it would be completely incorrect. The maximum value we could initialize it to is $1$ -- because it's the largest value that doesn't bring us beyond the index $r$ of the match segment $[l, r)$.

        Thus, as an **initial approximation** for $z[i]$ we can safely take:

        $$ z_0[i] = \min(r - i,\; z[i-l]) $$

        After having $z[i]$ initialized to $z_0[i]$, we try to increment $z[i]$ by running the **trivial algorithm** -- because in general, after the border $r$, we cannot know if the segment will continue to match or not.

    Thus, the whole algorithm is split in two cases, which differ only in **the initial value** of $z[i]$: in the first case it's assumed to be zero, in the second case it is determined by the previously computed values (using the above formula). After that, both branches of this algorithm can be reduced to the implementation of **the trivial algorithm**, which starts immediately after we specify the initial value.

    The algorithm turns out to be very simple. Despite the fact that on each iteration the trivial algorithm is run, we have made significant progress, having an algorithm that runs in linear time. Later on we will prove that the running time is linear.

    ## Implementation

    Implementation turns out to be rather concise:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> z_function(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> z(n);
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if(i < r) {
                z[i] = min(r - i, z[i - l]);
            }
            while(i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {
                z[i]++;
            }
            if(i + z[i] > r) {
                l = i;
                r = i + z[i];
            }
        }
        return z;
    }

    Title: String Hashing
    Part: 1/2
    # String Hashing

    Hashing algorithms are helpful in solving a lot of problems.

    We want to solve the problem of comparing strings efficiently.
    The brute force way of doing so is just to compare the letters of both strings, which has a time complexity of $O(\min(n_1, n_2))$ if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sizes of the two strings.
    We want to do better.
    The idea behind the string hashing is the following: we map each string into an integer and compare those instead of the strings.
    Doing this allows us to reduce the execution time of the string comparison to $O(1)$.

    For the conversion, we need a so-called **hash function**.
    The goal of it is to convert a string into an integer, the so-called **hash** of the string.
    The following condition has to hold: if two strings $s$ and $t$ are equal ($s = t$), then also their hashes have to be equal ($\text{hash}(s) = \text{hash}(t)$).
    Otherwise, we will not be able to compare strings.

    Notice, the opposite direction doesn't have to hold.
    If the hashes are equal ($\text{hash}(s) = \text{hash}(t)$), then the strings do not necessarily have to be equal.
    E.g. a valid hash function would be simply $\text{hash}(s) = 0$ for each $s$.
    Now, this is just a stupid example, because this function will be completely useless, but it is a valid hash function.
    The reason why the opposite direction doesn't have to hold, is because there are exponentially many strings.
    If we only want this hash function to distinguish between all strings consisting of lowercase characters of length smaller than 15, then already the hash wouldn't fit into a 64-bit integer (e.g. unsigned long long) any more, because there are so many of them.
    And of course, we don't want to compare arbitrary long integers, because this will also have the complexity $O(n)$.

    So usually we want the hash function to map strings onto numbers of a fixed range $[0, m)$, then comparing strings is just a comparison of two integers with a fixed length.
    And of course, we want $\text{hash}(s) \neq \text{hash}(t)$ to be very likely if $s \neq t$.

    That's the important part that you have to keep in mind.
    Using hashing will not be 100% deterministically correct, because two complete different strings might have the same hash (the hashes collide).
    However, in a wide majority of tasks, this can be safely ignored as the probability of the hashes of two different strings colliding is still very small.
    And we will discuss some techniques in this article how to keep the probability of collisions very low.

    ## Calculation of the hash of a string

    The good and widely used way to define the hash of a string $s$ of length $n$ is

    $$\begin{align}
    \text{hash}(s) &= s[0] + s[1] \cdot p + s[2] \cdot p^2 + ... + s[n-1] \cdot p^{n-1} \mod m \\
    &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \cdot p^i \mod m,
    \end{align}$$

    where $p$ and $m$ are some chosen, positive numbers.
    It is called a **polynomial rolling hash function**.

    It is reasonable to make $p$ a prime number roughly equal to the number of characters in the input alphabet.
    For example, if the input is composed of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, $p = 31$ is a good choice.
    If the input may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, then $p = 53$ is a possible choice.
    The code in this article will use $p = 31$.

    Obviously $m$ should be a large number since the probability of two random strings colliding is about $\approx \frac{1}{m}$.
    Sometimes $m = 2^{64}$ is chosen, since then the integer overflows of 64-bit integers work exactly like the modulo operation.
    However, there exists a method, which generates colliding strings (which work independently from the choice of $p$).
    So in practice, $m = 2^{64}$ is not recommended.
    A good choice for $m$ is some large prime number.
    The code in this article will just use $m = 10^9+9$.
    This is a large number, but still small enough so that we can perform multiplication of two values using 64-bit integers.

    Here is an example of calculating the hash of a string $s$, which contains only lowercase letters.
    We convert each character of $s$ to an integer.
    Here we use the conversion $a \rightarrow 1$, $b \rightarrow 2$, $\dots$, $z \rightarrow 26$.
    Converting $a \rightarrow 0$ is not a good idea, because then the hashes of the strings $a$, $aa$, $aaa$, $\dots$ all evaluate to $0$.

    ```{.cpp file=hashing_function}
    long long compute_hash(string const& s) {
        const int p = 31;
        const int m = 1e9 + 9;
        long long hash_value = 0;
        long long p_pow = 1;
        for (char c : s) {
            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;
            p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;
        }
        return hash_value;
    }
    ```

    Precomputing the powers of $p$ might give a performance boost.

    ## Example tasks

    ### Search for duplicate strings in an array of strings

    Problem: Given a list of $n$ strings $s_i$, each no longer than $m$ characters, find all the duplicate strings and divide them into groups.

    From the obvious algorithm involving sorting the strings, we would get a time complexity of $O(n m \log n)$ where the sorting requires $O(n \log n)$ comparisons and each comparison take $O(m)$ time.
    However, by using hashes, we reduce the comparison time to $O(1)$, giving us an algorithm that runs in $O(n m + n \log n)$ time.

    We calculate the hash for each string, sort the hashes together with the indices, and then group the indices by identical hashes.

    ```{.cpp file=hashing_group_identical_strings}
    vector<vector<int>> group_identical_strings(vector<string> const& s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<pair<long long, int>> hashes(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            hashes[i] = {compute_hash(s[i]), i};

        sort(hashes.begin(), hashes.end());

        vector<vector<int>> groups;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i == 0 || hashes[i].first != hashes[i-1].first)
                groups.emplace_back();
            groups.back().push_back(hashes[i].second);
        }
        return groups;
    }

    Chapter: Data structures
    Section: Comparison to sorting
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Comparison to sorting}

    It is often possible to solve a problem
    using either data structures or sorting.
    Sometimes there are remarkable differences
    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,
    which may be hidden in their time complexities.

    Let us consider a problem where
    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$
    that both contain $n$ elements.
    Our task is to calculate the number of elements
    that belong to both of the lists.
    For example, for the lists
    \[A = [5,2,8,9] \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\]
    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5
    and 9 belong to both of the lists.

    A straightforward solution to the problem is
    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,
    but next we will focus on
    more efficient algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,
    and after this, we iterate through the elements
    of $B$ and check for each elements if it
    also belongs to $A$.
    This is efficient because the elements of $A$
    are in a set.
    Using the \texttt{set} structure,
    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,
    so instead of the \texttt{set} structure
    we can also use the \texttt{unordered\_set} structure.
    This is an easy way to make the algorithm
    more efficient, because we only have to change
    the underlying data structure.
    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.
    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.
    After this, we iterate through both the lists
    at the same time and find the common elements.
    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n)$,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    so the total time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    The following table shows how efficient
    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and
    the elements of the lists are random
    integers between $1 \ldots 10^9$:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\
    $2 \cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\
    $3 \cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\
    $4 \cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\
    $5 \cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that
    they use different set structures.
    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on
    the running time, because Algorithm 2
    is 4–5 times faster than Algorithm 1.

    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3
    which uses sorting.
    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.
    Interestingly, the time complexity of both
    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \log n)$,
    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.
    This can be explained by the fact that
    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done
    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.
    On the other hand,
    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree
    during the whole algorithm.

INFO - raw_msg:
 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of strings, where each string represents a number. The function should convert these strings into integers and sort them in numerical order, returning a list of integers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - First, we will convert each string in the list to an integer.
   - Then, we will sort the list of integers.
   - Finally, we will return the sorted list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sort_numeric_strings(input_list):
       create an empty list called integer_list
       for each string in input_list:
           convert the string to an integer and add it to integer_list
       sort integer_list
       return integer_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sort_numeric_strings(input_list):
    # Create an empty list to hold the converted integers
    integer_list = []
    
    # Convert each string in the input list to an integer
    for num_str in input_list:
        integer_list.append(int(num_str))
    
    # Sort the list of integers
    integer_list.sort()
    
    # Return the sorted list of integers
    return integer_list
```
