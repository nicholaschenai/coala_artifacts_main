    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes two lists (or tuples) of numbers and returns a new list (or tuple) containing only the elements that are present in both input lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the common elements between the two lists, we can convert one of the lists into a set, which allows for efficient membership testing. Then, we can iterate through the other list and check which elements are also in the set. The common elements can be collected into a new list or tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function similar_elements(list1, list2):\n       create an empty set from list1\n       create an empty list for common elements\n       for each element in list2:\n           if the element is in the set:\n               add the element to the list of common elements\n       return the list of common elements\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef similar_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Create a set from the first list for efficient membership testing\n    set1 = set(list1)\n    # Initialize an empty list to store common elements\n    common_elements = []\n    # Iterate through each element in the second list\n    for element in list2:\n        # Check if the element is in the set created from the first list\n        if element in set1:\n            # If it is, add it to the list of common elements\n            common_elements.append(element)\n    # Return the list of common elements\n    return tuple(common_elements)  # Return as a tuple to match the expected output\n```",
