    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: We need to create a function that checks if a given integer can be expressed as the difference of two perfect squares. \n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: A number can be expressed as the difference of two squares if it can be represented in the form \\( a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b) \\). This means that the number must be expressible as a product of two factors, where one factor is even and the other can be either even or odd. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n   - If the number is odd, it can always be expressed as the difference of two squares.\n   - If the number is even, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares if it is divisible by 4.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function dif_Square(n):\n       if n is odd:\n           return True\n       else if n is even:\n           if n % 4 == 0:\n               return True\n           else:\n               return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_odd(n):\n    # Check if the number is odd\n    return n % 2 != 0\n\ndef is_divisible_by_4(n):\n    # Check if the number is divisible by 4\n    return n % 4 == 0\n\ndef dif_Square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # If the number is odd, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares\n    if is_odd(n):\n        return True\n    # If the number is even, check if it is divisible by 4\n    elif n % 2 == 0:\n        return is_divisible_by_4(n)\n    # If the number is even and not divisible by 4, it cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares\n    return False\n```",
