1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/750 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that combines the original list with the elements of the tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will define a function that accepts a list and a tuple. We will then convert the tuple into a list and concatenate it with the original list. Finally, we will return the new combined list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION add_tuple(list, tuple):
       CONVERT tuple to a list
       COMBINE the original list with the new list from the tuple
       RETURN the combined list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def add_tuple(lst, tpl):
    # Convert the tuple to a list
    tpl_as_list = list(tpl)
    # Combine the original list with the new list from the tuple
    combined_list = lst + tpl_as_list
    # Return the combined list
    return combined_list

    ```

        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\frac{x+y \sqrt{n}}{z}$.

    !!! example "[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)"
        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

            ```py
            x, k = map(int, input().split())

            mod = 10**9+7
        
            # compose (A[0]*x + A[1]) / (A[2]*x + A[3]) and (B[0]*x + B[1]) / (B[2]*x + B[3])

            A = [1, 0, 0, 1] # (x + 0) / (0*x + 1) = x

            a = sqrt(x)

            T = len(a) - 1 # period of a

            # apply ak + 1/x = (ak*x+1)/(1x+0) to (Ax + B) / (Cx + D)
