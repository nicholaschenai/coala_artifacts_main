    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the products of all possible sublists (or subarrays) of a given list of integers. For example, for the list `[1, 2, 3]`, we need to find all possible contiguous subarrays, calculate their products, and then sum those products together.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**:\n   - We will iterate through all possible starting points of subarrays.\n   - For each starting point, we will iterate through all possible ending points to form subarrays.\n   - For each subarray, we will calculate the product of its elements.\n   - We will maintain a running total of these products and return that total at the end.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr):\n       total_sum = 0\n       n = length of arr\n       for start from 0 to n-1:\n           product = 1\n           for end from start to n-1:\n               product *= arr[end]\n               total_sum += product\n       return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr):\n    total_sum = 0  # Initialize the total sum of products\n    n = len(arr)  # Get the length of the array\n    for start in range(n):  # Iterate over each starting index\n        product = 1  # Initialize product for the current subarray\n        for end in range(start, n):  # Iterate over each ending index\n            product *= arr[end]  # Update the product with the current element\n            total_sum += product  # Add the current product to the total sum\n    return total_sum  # Return the final sum of products\n```",
