    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes two tuples of numbers and divides the corresponding elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple, returning a new tuple with the results of these divisions.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   We will iterate through both tuples simultaneously, performing division on each pair of corresponding elements. We will store the results in a new tuple and return it. We need to ensure that the second tuple does not contain any zeros to avoid division by zero errors.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n       create an empty list to store results\n       for each index i from 0 to length of tuple1:\n           divide tuple1[i] by tuple2[i] and append the result to the results list\n       convert results list to a tuple\n       return the results tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Create an empty list to store results\n    results = []\n    \n    # Iterate through both tuples simultaneously\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Perform division and append the result to the results list\n        results.append(tuple1[i] // tuple2[i])  # Use integer division\n    \n    # Convert results list to a tuple\n    return tuple(results)\n\n```",
