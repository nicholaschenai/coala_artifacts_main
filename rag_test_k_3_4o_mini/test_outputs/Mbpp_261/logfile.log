INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/261 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. Each tuple contains numbers, and we want to divide the corresponding elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple. The result should be a new tuple containing the results of these divisions.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Create a function that accepts two tuples.
   - Iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements, perform the division of the first element by the second.
   - Collect the results of these divisions into a new tuple.
   - Return the new tuple as the output.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
       create an empty list to store results
       for each index in range of length of tuple1:
           divide element at index of tuple1 by element at index of tuple2
           append the result to the results list
       convert results list to a tuple
       return the tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def division_elements(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Create an empty list to store results
    results = []
    
    # Iterate through the elements of both tuples simultaneously
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Divide the element of the first tuple by the element of the second tuple
        result = tuple1[i] // tuple2[i]  # Using integer division
        # Append the result to the results list
        results.append(result)
    
    # Convert results list to a tuple
    return tuple(results)

        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\frac{x+y \sqrt{n}}{z}$.

    !!! example "[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)"
        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

            x, k = map(int, input().split())

            mod = 10**9+7
        
            # compose (A[0]*x + A[1]) / (A[2]*x + A[3]) and (B[0]*x + B[1]) / (B[2]*x + B[3])

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.
