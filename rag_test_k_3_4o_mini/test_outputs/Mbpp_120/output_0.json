    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The goal is to find the maximum product of the absolute values of the integers in each tuple, and return that maximum product.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each tuple in the list, calculate the product of the two integers in the tuple, and keep track of the maximum product found. Since we are interested in the absolute product, we will use the absolute values of the integers when calculating the product.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_product_tuple(tuples):\n       max_product = 0\n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           product = abs(tuple[0]) * abs(tuple[1])\n           if product > max_product:\n               max_product = product\n       return max_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef max_product_tuple(tuples):\n    max_product = 0  # Initialize the maximum product to 0\n    for tup in tuples:  # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n        product = abs(tup[0]) * abs(tup[1])  # Calculate the absolute product\n        if product > max_product:  # Check if the current product is greater than the max found so far\n            max_product = product  # Update the maximum product if necessary\n    return max_product  # Return the maximum product found\n```",
