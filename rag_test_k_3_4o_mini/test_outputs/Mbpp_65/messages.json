programming}\n\n    \\key{Dynamic programming}\n    is a technique that combines the correctness\n    of complete search and the efficiency\n    of greedy algorithms.\n    Dynamic programming can be applied if the\n    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems\n    that can be solved independently.\n\n    There are two uses for dynamic programming:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item\n    \\key{Finding an optimal solution}:\n    We want to find a solution that is\n    as large as possible or as small as possible.\n    \\item\n    \\key{Counting the number of solutions}:\n    We want to calculate the total number of\n    possible solutions.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    We will first see how dynamic programming can\n    be used to find an optimal solution,\n    and then we will use the same idea for\n    counting the solutions.\n\n    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone\n    in every competitive programmer's career.\n    While the basic idea is simple,\n    the challenge is how to apply\n    dynamic programming to different problems.\n    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems\n    that are a good starting point.\n\n    \\section{Coin problem}\n\n    We first focus on a problem that we\n    have already seen in Chapter 6:\n    Given a set of coin values $\\texttt{coins} = \\{c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_k\\}$\n    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to\n    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.\n\n    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a\n    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest\n    possible coin.\n    The greedy algorithm works, for example,\n    when the coins are the euro coins,\n    but in the general case the greedy algorithm\n    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.\n\n    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently\n    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm\n    works for any coin set.\n    The dynamic programming\n    algorithm is based on a recursive function\n    that goes through all possibilities how to\n    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.\n    However, the dynamic programming\n    algorithm is efficient because\n    it uses \\emph{memoization} and\n    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Recursive formulation}\n\n    The idea in dynamic programming is to\n    formulate the problem recursively so\n    that the solution to the problem can be\n    calculated from solutions to smaller\n    subproblems.\n    In the coin problem, a natural recursive\n    problem is as follows:\n    what is the smallest number of coins\n    required to form a sum $x$?\n\n    Let $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    denote the minimum\n    number of coins required for a sum $x$.\n    The values of the function depend on the\n    values of the coins.\n    For example, if $\\texttt{coins} = \\{1,3,4\\}$,\n    the first values of the function are as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    \\texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    For example, $\\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,\n    because at least 3 coins are needed\n    to form the sum 10.\n    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.\n\n    The essential property of $\\texttt{solve}$ is\n    that its values can be\n    recursively calculated from its smaller values.\n    The idea is to focus on the \\emph{first}\n    coin that we choose for the sum.\n    For example, in the above scenario,\n    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.\n    If we first choose coin 1,\n    the remaining task is to form the sum 9\n    using the minimum number of coins,\n    which is a subproblem of the original problem.\n    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.\n    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula\n    to calculate the minimum number of coins:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\min( & \\texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).\n    \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case of the recursion is $\\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    For example,\n    \\[ \\texttt{solve}(10) = \\texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \\texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \\texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\\]\n\n    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function\n    that calculates the minimum number of\n    coins needed to form a sum $x$:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n                   \\infty               & x < 0\\\\\n                   0               & x = 0\\\\\n                   \\min_{c \\in \\texttt{coins}} \\texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n\n    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\\infty$,\n    because it is impossible to form a negative\n    sum of money.\n    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through\n    all possibilities how to choose the first coin\n    of the sum.\n\n    Once a recursive function that solves the problem\n    has been found,\n    we can directly implement a solution in C++\n    (the constant \\texttt{INF} denotes infinity):\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Still, this function is not efficient,\n    because there may be an exponential number of ways\n    to construct the sum.\n    However, next we will see how to make the\n    function efficient using a technique called memoization.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Using memoization}\n\n    \\index{memoization}\n\n    The idea of dynamic programming is to use\n    \\key{memoization} to efficiently calculate\n    values of a recursive function.\n    This means that the values of the function\n    are stored in an array after calculating them.\n    For each parameter, the value of the function\n    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,\n    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.\n\n    In this problem, we use arrays\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    bool ready[N];\n    int value[N];\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    where $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates\n    whether the value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,\n    and if it is, $\\texttt{value}[x]$\n    contains this value.\n    The constant $N$ has been chosen so\n    that all required values fit in the arrays.\n\n    Now the function can be efficiently\n    implemented as follows:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        if (ready[x]) return value[x];\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        value[x] = best;\n        ready[x] = true;\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function handles the base cases\n    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.\n    Then the function checks from\n    $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ if\n    $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored\n    in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    and if it is, the function directly returns it.\n    Otherwise the function calculates the value\n    of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    recursively and stores it in $\\texttt{value}[x]$.\n\n    This function works efficiently,\n    because the answer for each parameter $x$\n    is calculated recursively only once.\n    After a value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the\n    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.\n    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(nk)$,\n    where $n$ is the target sum and $k$ is the number of coins.\n\n    Note that we can also \\emph{iteratively}\n    construct the array \\texttt{value} using\n    a loop that simply calculates all the values\n    of $\\texttt{solve}$ for parameters $0 \\ldots n\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Time complexity\n    Section: Calculation rules\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\chapter{Time complexity}\n\n    \\index{time complexity}\n\n    The efficiency of algorithms is important in competitive programming.\n    Usually, it is easy to design an algorithm\n    that solves the problem slowly,\n    but the real challenge is to invent a\n    fast algorithm.\n    If the algorithm is too slow, it will get only\n    partial points or no points at all.\n\n    The \\key{time complexity} of an algorithm\n    estimates how much time the algorithm will use\n    for some input.\n    The idea is to represent the efficiency\n    as a function whose parameter is the size of the input.\n    By calculating the time complexity,\n    we can find out whether the algorithm is fast enough\n    without implementing it.\n\n    \\section{Calculation rules}\n\n    The time complexity of an algorithm\n    is denoted $O(\\cdots)$\n    where the three dots represent some\n    function.\n    Usually, the variable $n$ denotes\n    the input size.\n    For example, if the input is an array of numbers,\n    $n$ will be the size of the array,\n    and if the input is a string,\n    $n$ will be the length of the string.\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Loops}\n\n    A common reason why an algorithm is slow is\n    that it contains many loops that go through the input.\n    The more nested loops the algorithm contains,\n    the slower it is.\n    If there are $k$ nested loops,\n    the time complexity is $O(n^k)$.\n\n    For example, the time complexity of the following code is $O(n)$:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    And the time complexity of the following code is $O(n^2)$:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {\n            // code\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Order of magnitude}\n\n    A time complexity does not tell us the exact number\n    of times the code inside a loop is executed,\n    but it only shows the order of magnitude.\n    In the following examples, the code inside the loop\n    is executed $3n$, $n+5$ and $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$ times,\n    but the time complexity of each code is $O(n)$.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= 3*n; i++) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n+5; i++) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 2) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    As another example,\n    the time complexity of the following code is $O(n^2)$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        for (int j = i+1; j <= n; j++) {\n            // code\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Phases}\n\n    If the algorithm consists of consecutive phases,\n    the total time complexity is the largest\n    time complexity of a single phase.\n    The reason for this is that the slowest\n    phase is usually the bottleneck of the code.\n\n    For example, the following code consists\n    of three phases with time complexities\n    $O(n)$, $O(n^2)$ and $O(n)$.\n    Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n^2)$.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        // code\n    }\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {\n            // code\n        }\n    }\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Several variables}\n\n    Sometimes the time complexity depends on\n    several factors.\n    In this case, the time complexity formula\n    contains several variables.\n\n    For example, the time complexity of the\n    following code is $O(nm)$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {\n            // code\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Recursion}\n\n    The time complexity of a recursive function\n    depends on the number of times the function is called\n    and the time complexity of a single call.\n    The total time complexity is the product of\n    these values.\n\n    For example, consider the following function:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void f(int n) {\n        if (n == 1) return;\n        f(n-1);\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    The call $\\texttt{f}(n)$ causes $n$ function calls,\n    and the time complexity of each call is $O(1)$.\n    Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n)$.\n\n    As another example, consider the following function:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void g(int n) {\n        if (n == 1) return;\n        g(n-1);\n        g(n-1);\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    In this case each function call generates two other\n    calls, except for $n=1$.\n    Let us see what happens when $g$ is called\n    with parameter $n$.\n    The following table shows the function calls\n    produced by this single call:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rr}\n    function call & number of calls \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $g(n)$ & 1 \\\\\n    $g(n-1)$ & 2 \\\\\n    $g(n-2)$ & 4 \\\\\n    $\\cdots$ & $\\cdots$ \\\\\n    $g(1)$ & $2^{n-1}$ \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n    Based on this, the time complexity is\n    \\[1+2+4+\\cdots+2^{n-1} = 2^n-1 = O(2^n).\\]\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Tree algorithms\n    Section: Tree traversal\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\chapter{Tree algorithms}\n\n    \\index{tree}\n\n    A \\key{tree} is a connected, acyclic graph\n    that consists of $n$ nodes and $n-1$ edges.\n    Removing any edge from a tree divides it\n    into two components,\n    and adding any edge to a tree creates a cycle.\n    Moreover, there is always a unique path between any\n    two nodes of a tree.\n\n    For example, the following tree consists of 8 nodes and 7 edges:\n

graph traversal algorithms\n    can be used to traverse the nodes of a tree.\n    However, the traversal of a tree is easier to implement than\n    that of a general graph, because\n    there are no cycles in the tree and it is not\n    possible to reach a node from multiple directions.\n\n    The typical way to traverse a tree is to start\n    a depth-first search at an arbitrary node.\n    The following recursive function can be used:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void dfs(int s, int e) {\n        // process node s\n        for (auto u : adj[s]) {\n            if (u != e) dfs(u, s);\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function is given two parameters: the current node $s$\n    and the previous node $e$.\n    The purpose of the parameter $e$ is to make sure\n    that the search only moves to nodes\n    that have not been visited yet.\n\n    The following function call starts the search\n    at node $x$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    dfs(x, 0);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    In the first call $e=0$, because there is no\n    previous node, and it is allowed\n    to proceed to any direction in the tree.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Dynamic programming}\n\n    Dynamic programming can be used to calculate\n    some information during a tree traversal.\n    Using dynamic programming, we can, for example,\n    calculate in $O(n)$ time for each node of a rooted tree the\n    number of nodes in its subtree\n    or the length of the longest path from the node\n    to a leaf.\n\n    As an example, let us calculate for each node $s$\n    a value $\\texttt{count}[s]$: the number of nodes in its subtree.\n    The subtree contains the node itself and\n    all nodes in the subtrees of its children,\n    so we can calculate the number of nodes\n    recursively using the following code:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void dfs(int s, int e) {\n        count[s] = 1;\n        for (auto u : adj[s]) {\n            if (u == e) continue;\n            dfs(u, s);\n            count[s] += count[u];\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

After flattening, the function should sum all the integers in the resulting list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. The function will check each element of the input list. If the element is an integer, it will be added to a running total. If the element is a list, the function will call itself with that list as the argument, effectively flattening it. This process will continue until all elements are processed, and the total sum will be returned.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function recursive_list_sum(input_list):\n       total = 0\n       for each element in input_list:\n           if element is an integer:\n               total += element\n           else if element is a list:\n               total += recursive_list_sum(element)\n       return total\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef recursive_list_sum(input_list):\n    # Initialize total sum to 0\n    total = 0\n    # Iterate through each element in the input list\n    for element in input_list:\n        # If the element is an integer, add it to total\n        if isinstance(element, int):\n            total += element\n        # If the element is a list, recursively call the function\n        elif isinstance(element, list):\n            total += recursive_list_sum(element)\n    # Return the total sum\n    return total\n```"
