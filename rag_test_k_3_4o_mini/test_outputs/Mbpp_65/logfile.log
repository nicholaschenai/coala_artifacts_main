INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/65 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a nested list (a list that can contain other lists) and returns the sum of all the numbers in that list, regardless of how deeply nested they are.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. The function will check each element of the list:
   - If the element is a number, we will add it to our total sum.
   - If the element is another list, we will call the same function on that list to get its sum and add that to our total.
   This way, we can handle lists of any depth.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function recursive_list_sum(input_list):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for each element in input_list:
           if element is a number:
               add element to total_sum
           else if element is a list:
               call recursive_list_sum on element and add the result to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def recursive_list_sum(input_list):
    # Initialize the total sum to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each element in the input list
    for element in input_list:
        # If the element is a number, add it to the total sum
        if isinstance(element, int):
            total_sum += element
        # If the element is a list, recursively call the function on that list
        elif isinstance(element, list):
            total_sum += recursive_list_sum(element)
    
    # Return the total sum of all elements
    return total_sum

    Chapter: Dynamic programming
    Section: Coin problem
    Part: 1/2
    \chapter{Dynamic programming}

    \index{dynamic programming}

    \key{Dynamic programming}
    is a technique that combines the correctness
    of complete search and the efficiency
    of greedy algorithms.
    Dynamic programming can be applied if the
    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems
    that can be solved independently.

    There are two uses for dynamic programming:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \key{Finding an optimal solution}:
    We want to find a solution that is
    as large as possible or as small as possible.
    \item
    \key{Counting the number of solutions}:
    We want to calculate the total number of
    possible solutions.
    \end{itemize}

    We will first see how dynamic programming can
    be used to find an optimal solution,
    and then we will use the same idea for
    counting the solutions.

    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone
    in every competitive programmer's career.
    While the basic idea is simple,
    the challenge is how to apply
    dynamic programming to different problems.
    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems
    that are a good starting point.

    \section{Coin problem}

    We first focus on a problem that we
    have already seen in Chapter 6:
    Given a set of coin values $\texttt{coins} = \{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k\}$
    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to
    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.

    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a
    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest
    possible coin.
    The greedy algorithm works, for example,
    when the coins are the euro coins,
    but in the general case the greedy algorithm
    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.

    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently
    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm
    works for any coin set.
    The dynamic programming
    algorithm is based on a recursive function
    that goes through all possibilities how to
    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.
    However, the dynamic programming
    algorithm is efficient because
    it uses \emph{memoization} and
    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.

    \subsubsection{Recursive formulation}

    The idea in dynamic programming is to
    formulate the problem recursively so
    that the solution to the problem can be
    calculated from solutions to smaller
    subproblems.
    In the coin problem, a natural recursive
    problem is as follows:
    what is the smallest number of coins
    required to form a sum $x$?

    Let $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    denote the minimum
    number of coins required for a sum $x$.
    The values of the function depend on the
    values of the coins.
    For example, if $\texttt{coins} = \{1,3,4\}$,
    the first values of the function are as follows:

    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\
    \texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,
    because at least 3 coins are needed
    to form the sum 10.
    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.

    The essential property of $\texttt{solve}$ is
    that its values can be
    recursively calculated from its smaller values.
    The idea is to focus on the \emph{first}
    coin that we choose for the sum.
    For example, in the above scenario,
    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.
    If we first choose coin 1,
    the remaining task is to form the sum 9
    using the minimum number of coins,
    which is a subproblem of the original problem.
    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.
    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula
    to calculate the minimum number of coins:
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \texttt{solve}(x) = \min( & \texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case of the recursion is $\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    For example,
    \[ \texttt{solve}(10) = \texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\]

    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function
    that calculates the minimum number of
    coins needed to form a sum $x$:
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{solve}(x) = \begin{cases}
                   \infty               & x < 0\\
                   0               & x = 0\\
                   \min_{c \in \texttt{coins}} \texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\infty$,
    because it is impossible to form a negative
    sum of money.
    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through
    all possibilities how to choose the first coin
    of the sum.

    Once a recursive function that solves the problem
    has been found,
    we can directly implement a solution in C++
    (the constant \texttt{INF} denotes infinity):

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Still, this function is not efficient,
    because there may be an exponential number of ways
    to construct the sum.
    However, next we will see how to make the
    function efficient using a technique called memoization.

    \subsubsection{Using memoization}

    \index{memoization}

    The idea of dynamic programming is to use
    \key{memoization} to efficiently calculate
    values of a recursive function.
    This means that the values of the function
    are stored in an array after calculating them.
    For each parameter, the value of the function
    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,
    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.

    In this problem, we use arrays
    \begin{lstlisting}
    bool ready[N];
    int value[N];
    \end{lstlisting}

    where $\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates
    whether the value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,
    and if it is, $\texttt{value}[x]$
    contains this value.
    The constant $N$ has been chosen so
    that all required values fit in the arrays.

    Now the function can be efficiently
    implemented as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        if (ready[x]) return value[x];
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        value[x] = best;
        ready[x] = true;
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function handles the base cases
    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.
    Then the function checks from
    $\texttt{ready}[x]$ if
    $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored
    in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    and if it is, the function directly returns it.
    Otherwise the function calculates the value
    of $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    recursively and stores it in $\texttt{value}[x]$.

    This function works efficiently,
    because the answer for each parameter $x$
    is calculated recursively only once.
    After a value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the
    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.
    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(nk)$,
    where $n$ is the target sum and $k$ is the number of coins.

    Note that we can also \emph{iteratively}
    construct the array \texttt{value} using
    a loop that simply calculates all the values
    of $\texttt{solve}$ for parameters $0 \ldots n

    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{Time complexity}

    \index{time complexity}

    The efficiency of algorithms is important in competitive programming.
    Usually, it is easy to design an algorithm
    that solves the problem slowly,
    but the real challenge is to invent a
    fast algorithm.
    If the algorithm is too slow, it will get only
    partial points or no points at all.

    The \key{time complexity} of an algorithm
    estimates how much time the algorithm will use
    for some input.
    The idea is to represent the efficiency
    as a function whose parameter is the size of the input.
    By calculating the time complexity,
    we can find out whether the algorithm is fast enough
    without implementing it.

    \section{Calculation rules}

    The time complexity of an algorithm
    is denoted $O(\cdots)$
    where the three dots represent some
    function.
    Usually, the variable $n$ denotes
    the input size.
    For example, if the input is an array of numbers,
    $n$ will be the size of the array,
    and if the input is a string,
    $n$ will be the length of the string.

    \subsubsection*{Loops}

    A common reason why an algorithm is slow is
    that it contains many loops that go through the input.
    The more nested loops the algorithm contains,
    the slower it is.
    If there are $k$ nested loops,
    the time complexity is $O(n^k)$.

    For example, the time complexity of the following code is $O(n)$:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    And the time complexity of the following code is $O(n^2)$:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            // code
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection*{Order of magnitude}

    A time complexity does not tell us the exact number
    of times the code inside a loop is executed,
    but it only shows the order of magnitude.
    In the following examples, the code inside the loop
    is executed $3n$, $n+5$ and $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ times,
    but the time complexity of each code is $O(n)$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3*n; i++) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n+5; i++) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += 2) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    As another example,
    the time complexity of the following code is $O(n^2)$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = i+1; j <= n; j++) {
            // code
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection*{Phases}

    If the algorithm consists of consecutive phases,
    the total time complexity is the largest
    time complexity of a single phase.
    The reason for this is that the slowest
    phase is usually the bottleneck of the code.

    For example, the following code consists
    of three phases with time complexities
    $O(n)$, $O(n^2)$ and $O(n)$.
    Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // code
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            // code
        }
    }
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // code
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection*{Several variables}

    Sometimes the time complexity depends on
    several factors.
    In this case, the time complexity formula
    contains several variables.

    For example, the time complexity of the
    following code is $O(nm)$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            // code
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection*{Recursion}

    The time complexity of a recursive function
    depends on the number of times the function is called
    and the time complexity of a single call.
    The total time complexity is the product of
    these values.

    For example, consider the following function:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    void f(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return;
        f(n-1);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    The call $\texttt{f}(n)$ causes $n$ function calls,
    and the time complexity of each call is $O(1)$.
    Thus, the total time complexity is $O(n)$.

    As another example, consider the following function:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    void g(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return;
        g(n-1);
        g(n-1);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    In this case each function call generates two other
    calls, except for $n=1$.
    Let us see what happens when $g$ is called
    with parameter $n$.
    The following table shows the function calls
    produced by this single call:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rr}
    function call & number of calls \\
    \hline
    $g(n)$ & 1 \\
    $g(n-1)$ & 2 \\
    $g(n-2)$ & 4 \\
    $\cdots$ & $\cdots$ \\
    $g(1)$ & $2^{n-1}$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    Based on this, the time complexity is
    \[1+2+4+\cdots+2^{n-1} = 2^n-1 = O(2^n).\]

    \index{tree}

    A \key{tree} is a connected, acyclic graph
    that consists of $n$ nodes and $n-1$ edges.
    Removing any edge from a tree divides it
    into two components,
    and adding any edge to a tree creates a cycle.
    Moreover, there is always a unique path between any
    two nodes of a tree.

    For example, the following tree consists of 8 nodes and 7 edges:

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \index{leaf}

    The \key{leaves} of a tree are the nodes
    with degree 1, i.e., with only one neighbor.
    For example, the leaves of the above tree
    are nodes 3, 5, 7 and 8.

    \index{root}
    \index{rooted tree}

    In a \key{rooted} tree, one of the nodes
    is appointed the \key{root} of the tree,
    and all other nodes are
    placed underneath the root.
    For example, in the following tree,
    node 1 is the root node.

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (2,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (-2,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (0,1) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (7) at (2,-1) {$7$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (-3,-1) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (-1,-1) {$6$};
    \node[draw, circle] (8) at (-1,-3) {$8$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (4) -- (7);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (6) -- (8);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \index{child}
    \index{parent}

    In a rooted tree, the \key{children} of a node
    are its lower neighbors, and the \key{parent} of a node
    is its upper neighbor.
    Each node has exactly one parent,
    except for the root that does not have a parent.
    For example, in the above tree,
    the children of node 2 are nodes 5 and 6,
    and its parent is node 1.

    \index{subtree}

    The structure of a rooted tree is \emph{recursive}:
    each node of the tree acts as the root of a \key{subtree}
    that contains the node itself and all nodes
    that are in the subtrees of its children.
    For example, in the above tree, the subtree of node 2
    consists of nodes 2, 5, 6 and 8:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (-2,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (-3,-1) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (-1,-1) {$6$};
    \node[draw, circle] (8) at (-1,-3) {$8$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (6) -- (8);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \section{Tree traversal}

    General graph traversal algorithms
    can be used to traverse the nodes of a tree.
    However, the traversal of a tree is easier to implement than
    that of a general graph, because
    there are no cycles in the tree and it is not
    possible to reach a node from multiple directions.

    The typical way to traverse a tree is to start
    a depth-first search at an arbitrary node.
    The following recursive function can be used:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    void dfs(int s, int e) {
        // process node s
        for (auto u : adj[s]) {
            if (u != e) dfs(u, s);
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function is given two parameters: the current node $s$
    and the previous node $e$.
    The purpose of the parameter $e$ is to make sure
    that the search only moves to nodes
    that have not been visited yet.

    The following function call starts the search
    at node $x$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    dfs(x, 0);
    \end{lstlisting}

    In the first call $e=0$, because there is no
    previous node, and it is allowed
    to proceed to any direction in the tree.

    \subsubsection{Dynamic programming}

    Dynamic programming can be used to calculate
    some information during a tree traversal.
    Using dynamic programming, we can, for example,
    calculate in $O(n)$ time for each node of a rooted tree the
    number of nodes in its subtree
    or the length of the longest path from the node
    to a leaf.

    As an example, let us calculate for each node $s$
    a value $\texttt{count}[s]$: the number of nodes in its subtree.
    The subtree contains the node itself and
    all nodes in the subtrees of its children,
    so we can calculate the number of nodes
    recursively using the following code:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    void dfs(int s, int e) {
        count[s] = 1;
        for (auto u : adj[s]) {
            if (u == e) continue;
            dfs(u, s);
            count[s] += count[u];
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/65 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a nested list (which can contain integers and other lists) and flattens it into a single list of integers. After flattening, the function should sum all the integers in the resulting list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. The function will check each element of the input list. If the element is an integer, it will be added to a running total. If the element is a list, the function will call itself with that list as the argument, effectively flattening it. This process will continue until all elements are processed, and the total sum will be returned.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function recursive_list_sum(input_list):
       total = 0
       for each element in input_list:
           if element is an integer:
               total += element
           else if element is a list:
               total += recursive_list_sum(element)
       return total
   ```

def recursive_list_sum(input_list):
