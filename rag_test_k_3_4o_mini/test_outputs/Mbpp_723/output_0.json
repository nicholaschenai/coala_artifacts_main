    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes two lists of equal length and counts how many times the elements at the same index in both lists are equal.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through both lists simultaneously, comparing the elements at each index. Each time we find that the elements are the same, we will increment a counter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the counter as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for i from 0 to length of list1 - 1:\n           if list1[i] is equal to list2[i]:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_same_pair(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of equal indices\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Check if the elements at the same index are equal\n        if list1[i] == list2[i]:\n            # Increment the count if they are equal\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of equal indices\n    return count\n```",
