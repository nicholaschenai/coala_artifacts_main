    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a tuple and a dictionary as inputs. The function should return a new tuple that includes all the elements of the original tuple followed by the dictionary.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The solution involves creating a new tuple that combines the elements of the input tuple with the dictionary. Since tuples are immutable in Python, we will create a new tuple that includes the original elements and the dictionary as the last element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function named `add_dict_to_tuple` that takes two parameters: a tuple and a dictionary.\n   - Create a new tuple that consists of the original tuple elements followed by the dictionary.\n   - Return the new tuple.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function that takes a tuple and a dictionary as input\ndef add_dict_to_tuple(tup, dct):\n    # Create a new tuple that includes all elements of the original tuple\n    # followed by the dictionary\n    new_tuple = tup + (dct,)\n    # Return the new tuple\n    return new_tuple\n```",
