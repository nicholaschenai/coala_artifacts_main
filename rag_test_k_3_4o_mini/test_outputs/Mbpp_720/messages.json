\\subsubsection*{Diophantine equations}\n\n    \\index{Diophantine equation}\n\n    A \\key{Diophantine equation}\n    %\\footnote{Diophantus of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician who lived in the 3th century.}\n    is an equation of the form\n    \\[ ax + by = c, \\]\n    where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants\n    and the values of $x$ and $y$ should be found.\n    Each number in the equation has to be an integer.\n    For example, one solution for the equation\n    $5x+2y=11$ is $x=3$ and $y=-2$.\n\n    \\index{extended Euclid's algorithm}\n\n    We can efficiently solve a Diophantine equation\n    by using Euclid's algorithm.\n    It turns out that we can extend Euclid's algorithm\n    so that it will find numbers $x$ and $y$\n    that satisfy the following equation:\n    \\[\n    ax + by = \\textrm{gcd}(a,b)\n    \\]\n\n    A Diophantine equation can be solved if\n    $c$ is divisible by\n    $\\textrm{gcd}(a,b)$,\n    and otherwise it cannot be solved.\n\n    As an example, let us find numbers $x$ and $y$\n    that satisfy the following equation:\n    \\[\n    39x + 15y = 12\n    \\]\n    The equation can be solved, because\n    $\\textrm{gcd}(39,15)=3$ and $3 \\mid 12$.\n    When Euclid's algorithm calculates the\n    greatest common divisor of 39 and 15,\n    it produces the following sequence of function calls:\n    \\[\n    \\textrm{gcd}(39,15) = \\textrm{gcd}(15,9)\n    = \\textrm{gcd}(9,6) = \\textrm{gcd}(6,3)\n    = \\textrm{gcd}(3,0) = 3 \\]\n    This corresponds to the following equations:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    39 - 2 \\cdot 15 & = & 9 \\\\\n    15 - 1 \\cdot 9 & = & 6 \\\\\n    9 - 1 \\cdot 6 & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n    Using these equations, we can derive\n    \\[\n    39 \\cdot 2 + 15 \\cdot (-5) = 3\n    \\]\n    and by multiplying this by 4, the result is\n    \\[\n    39 \\cdot 8 + 15 \\cdot (-20) = 12,\n    \\]\n    so a solution to the equation is\n    $x=8$ and $y=-20$.\n\n    A solution to a Diophantine equation is not unique,\n    because we can form an infinite number of solutions\n    if we know one solution.\n    If a pair $(x,y)$ is a solution, then also all pairs\n    \\[(x+\\frac{kb}{\\textrm{gcd}(a,b)},y-\\frac{ka}{\\textrm{gcd}(a,b)})\\]\n    are solutions, where $k$ is any integer.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Chinese remainder theorem}\n\n    \\index{Chinese remainder theorem}\n\n    The \\key{Chinese remainder theorem} solves\n    a group of equations of the form\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    x & = & a_1 \\bmod m_1 \\\\\n    x & = & a_2 \\bmod m_2 \\\\\n    \\cdots \\\\\n    x & = & a_n \\bmod m_n \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n    where all pairs of $m_1,m_2,\\ldots,m_n$ are coprime.\n\n    Let $x^{-1}_m$ be the inverse of $x$ modulo $m$, and\n    \\[ X_k = \\frac{m_1 m_2 \\cdots m_n}{m_k}.\\]\n    Using this notation, a solution to the equations is\n    \\[x = a_1 X_1 {X_1}^{-1}_{m_1} + a_2 X_2 {X_2}^{-1}_{m_2} + \\cdots + a_n X_n {X_n}^{-1}_{m_n}.\\]\n    In this solution, for each $k=1,2,\\ldots,n$,\n    \\[a_k X_k {X_k}^{-1}_{m_k} \\bmod m_k = a_k,\\]\n    because\n    \\[X_k {X_k}^{-1}_{m_k} \\bmod m_k = 1.\\]\n    Since all other terms in the sum are divisible by $m_k$,\n    they have no effect on the remainder,\n    and $x \\bmod m_k = a_k$.\n\n    For example, a solution for\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    x & = & 3 \\bmod 5 \\\\\n    x & = & 4 \\bmod 7 \\\\\n    x & = & 2 \\bmod 3 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n    is\n    \\[ 3 \\cdot 21 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 1 + 2 \\cdot 35 \\cdot 2 = 263.\\]\n\n    Once we have found a solution $x$,\n    we can create an infinite number of other solutions,\n    because all numbers of the form\n    \\[x+m_1 m_2 \\cdots m_n\\]\n    are solutions.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Introduction\n    Section: Input and output\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Input and output}\n\n

\\texttt{cout} for output.\n    In addition, the C functions\n    \\texttt{scanf} and \\texttt{printf} can be used.\n\n    The input for the program usually consists of\n    numbers and strings that are separated with\n    spaces and newlines.\n    They can be read from the \\texttt{cin} stream\n    as follows:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int a, b;\n    string x;\n    cin >> a >> b >> x;\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    This kind of code always works,\n    assuming that there is at least one space\n    or newline between each element in the input.\n    For example, the above code can read\n    both of the following inputs:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    123 456 monkey\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    123    456\n    monkey\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    The \\texttt{cout}

\\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Input and output is sometimes\n    a bottleneck in the program.\n    The following lines at the beginning of the code\n    make input and output more efficient:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);\n    cin.tie(0);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Note that the newline \\texttt{\"\\textbackslash n\"}\n    works faster than \\texttt{endl},\n    because \\texttt{endl} always causes\n    a flush operation.\n\n    The C functions \\texttt{scanf}\n    and \\texttt{printf} are an alternative\n    to the C++ standard streams.\n    They are usually a bit faster,\n    but they are also more difficult to use.\n    The following code reads two integers from the input:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int a, b;\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    The following code prints two integers:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int a = 123, b = 456;\n    printf(\"%d %d\\n\", a, b);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Sometimes the program should read a whole line\n    from the input, possibly containing spaces.\n    This can be accomplished by using the\n    \\texttt{getline} function:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    string s;\n    getline(cin, s);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    If the amount of data is unknown, the following\n    loop is useful:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    while (cin >> x) {\n        // code\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    This loop reads elements from the input\n    one after another, until there is no\n    more data available in the input.\n\n    In some contest systems, files are used for\n    input and output.\n    An easy solution for this is to write\n    the code as usual using standard streams,\n    but add the following lines to the beginning of the code:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    freopen(\"input.txt\", \"r\", stdin);\n    freopen(\"output.txt\", \"w\", stdout);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this, the program reads the input from the file\n    ''input.txt'' and writes the output to the file\n    ''output.txt''.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n    Part: 1/5\n    # The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n\n    The inclusion-exclusion principle is an important combinatorial way to compute the size of a set or the probability of complex events. It relates the sizes of individual sets with their union.\n\n    ## Statement\n\n    ### The verbal formula\n\n    The inclusion-exclusion principle can be expressed as follows:\n\n    To compute the size of a union of multiple sets, it is necessary to sum the sizes of these sets **separately**, and then subtract the sizes of all **pairwise** intersections of the sets, then add back the size of the intersections of **triples** of the sets, subtract the size of **quadruples** of the sets, and so on, up to the intersection of **all** sets.\n\n    ### The formulation in terms of sets\n\n    The above definition can be expressed mathematically as follows:\n\n    $$\\left| \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right| = \\sum_{i=1}^n|A_i| - \\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n} |A_i \\cap A_j| + \\sum _{1\\leq i<j<k\\leq n}|A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} | A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n |$$\n\n    And in a more compact way:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right| = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\\Biggl |}\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}{\\Biggr |}$$\n\n    ### The formulation using Venn diagrams\n\n    Let the diagram show three sets $A$, $B$ and $C$:\n\n    ![Venn diagram](venn-inclusion-exclusion.png \"Venn diagram\")\n\n    Then the area of their union $A \\cup B \\cup C$ is equal to the sum of the areas $A$, $B$ and $C$ less double-covered areas $A \\cap B$, $A \\cap C$, $B \\cap C$, but with the addition of the area covered by three sets $A \\cap B \\cap C$:\n\n    $$S(A \\cup B \\cup C) = S(A) + S(B) + S(C) - S(A \\cap B) - S(A \\cap C) - S(B \\cap C) + S(A \\cap B \\cap C)$$\n\n    It can also be generalized for an association of $n$ sets.\n\n    ### The formulation in terms of probability theory\n\n    If $A_i$ $(i = 1,2...n)$ are events and ${\\cal P}(A_i)$ the probability of an event from $A_i$ to occur, then the probability of their union (i.e. the probability that at least one of the events occur) is equal to:\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    {\\cal P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) &=& \\sum_{i=1}^n{\\cal P}(A_i)\\ - \\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n} {\\cal P}(A_i \\cap A_j)\\  + \\\\\n    &+& \\sum _{1\\leq i<j<k\\leq n}{\\cal P}(A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k) - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} {\\cal P}( A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n )\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    And in a more compact way:\n\n    $${\\cal P} \\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\\ {\\cal P}{\\Biggl (}\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}{\\Biggr )}$$\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    For the proof it is convenient to use the mathematical formulation in terms of set theory:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right| = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\\Biggl |}\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}{\\Biggr |}$$\n\n    We want to prove that any element contained in at least one of the sets $A_i$ will occur in the formula only once (note that elements which are not present in any of the sets $A_i$ will never be considered on the right part of the formula).\n\n    Consider an element $x$ occurring in $k \\geq 1$ sets $A_i$. We will show it is counted only once in the formula. Note that:\n\n    * in terms which $|J| = 1$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\\ k$** times;\n    * in terms which $|J| = 2$, the item $x$ will be counted **$-\\ \\binom{k}{2}$** times - because it will be counted in those terms that include two of the $k$ sets containing $x$;\n    * in terms which $|J| = 3$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\\ \\binom{k}{3}$** times;\n    * $\\cdots$\n    * in terms which $|J| = k$, the item $x$ will be counted **$(-1)^{k-1}\\cdot \\binom{k}{k}$** times;\n    * in terms which $|J| \\gt k$, the item $x$ will be counted **zero** times;\n\n    This leads us to the following sum of [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):\n\n    $$ T = \\binom{k}{1} - \\binom{k}{2} + \\binom{k}{3} - \\cdots + (-1)^{i-1}\\cdot \\binom{k}{i} + \\cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\\cdot \\binom{k}{k}$$\n\n    This expression is very similar to the binomial expansion of $(1 - x)^k$:\n\n    $$ (1 - x)^k = \\binom{k}{0} - \\binom{k}{1} \\cdot x + \\binom{k}{2} \\cdot x^2 - \\binom{k}{3} \\cdot x^3 + \\cdots + (-1)^k\\cdot \\binom{k}{k} \\cdot x^k $$\n\n    When $x = 1$, $(1 - x)^k$ looks a lot like $T$. However, the expression has an additional $\\binom{k}{0} = 1$, and it is multiplied by $-1$. That leads us to $(1 - 1)^k = 1 - T$. Therefore $T = 1 - (1 - 1)^k = 1$, what was required to prove. The element is counted only once.\n\n    ## Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly $r$ sets {data-toc-label=\"Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly r sets\"}\n\n    Inclusion-exclusion principle can be rewritten to calculate number of elements which are present in zero sets:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcap_{i=1}^n \\overline{A_i}\\right|=\\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \\sum_{|X|=m} \\left|\\bigcap_{i\\in X} A_{i}\\right|$$\n\n    Consider its generalization to calculate number of elements which are present in exactly $r$ sets:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcup_{|B|=r}\\left[\\bigcap_{i \\in B} A_i \\cap \\bigcap_{j \\not\\in B} \\overline{A_j}\\right]\\right|=\\sum_{m=r}^n (-1)^{m-r}\\dbinom{m}{r} \\sum_{|X|=m} \\left|\\bigcap_{i \\in X} A_{i}\\right|$$\n\n    To prove this formula, consider some particular $B$. Due to basic inclusion-exclusion principle we can say about it that:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcap_{i \\in B} A_i \\cap \\bigcap_{j \\not \\in B} \\overline{A_j}\\right|=\\sum_{m=r}^{n} (-1)^{m-r} \\sum_{\\substack{|X|=m \\newline B \\subset X}}\\left|\\bigcap_{i\\in X} A_{i}\\right|$$\n\n    The sets on the left side do not intersect for different $B$, thus we can sum them up directly. Also one should note that any set $X$ will always have coefficient $(-1)^{m-r}$ if it occurs and it will occur for exactly $\\dbinom{m}{r}$ sets $B$. \n\n    ## Usage when solving problems\n\n    The inclusion-exclusion principle is hard to understand without studying its applications.\n\n    First, we will look at three simplest tasks \"at paper\", illustrating applications of the principle, and then consider more practical problems which are difficult to solve without inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n    Tasks asking to \"find the **number** of ways\" are worth of note, as they sometimes lead to polynomial solutions, not necessarily exponential.\n\n    ### A simple task on permutations\n\n    Task: count how many permutations of numbers from $0$ to $9$ exist such that the first element is greater than $1$ and the last one is less than $8$.\n\n    Let's count the number of \"bad\" permutations, that is, permutations in which the first element is $\\leq 1$ and/or the last is $\\geq 8$.\n\n    We will denote by $X$ the set of permutations in which the first element is $\\leq 1$ and $Y$ the set of permutations in which the last element is $\\geq 8$. Then the number of \"bad\" permutations, as on the inclusion-exclusion formula, will be:\n\n    $$ |X \\cup Y| = |X| + |Y| - |X \\cap Y| $$\n\n    After a simple combinatorial calculation, we will get to:\n\n    $$ 2 \\cdot 9! + 2 \\cdot 9! - 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8! $$\n\n    The only thing left is to subtract this number from the total of $10!$ to get the number of \"good\" permutations.\n\n    ### A simple task on (0, 1, 2) sequences\n\n    Task: count how many sequences of length $n$ exist consisting only of numbers $0,1,2$ such that each number occurs **at least once**.\n\n    Again let us turn to the inverse problem, i.e. we calculate the number of sequences which do **not** contain **at least one** of the numbers.\n\n    Let's denote by $A_i (i = 0,1,2)$ the set of sequences in which the digit $i$ does **not** occur.\n    The formula of inclusion-exclusion on the number of \"bad\" sequences will be:\n\n    $$ |A_0 \\cup A_1 \\cup A_2| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_0 \\cap A_1| - |A_0 \\cap A_2| - |A_1 \\cap A_2| + |A_0 \\cap A_1 \\cap A_2| $$\n\n    * The size of each $A_i$ is $2^n$, as each sequence can only contain two of the digits.\n    * The size of each pairwise intersection $A_i \\cap A_j$  is equal to $1$, as there will be only one digit to build the sequence.\n    * The size of the intersection of all three sets is equal to $0$, as there will be no digits to build the sequence.\n\n    As we solved the inverse problem, we subtract it from the total of $3^n$ sequences:\n\n    $$3^n - (3 \\cdot 2^n - 3 \\cdot 1 + 0)$$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
