    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that calculates the angle of a complex number in radians. The angle is measured from the positive x-axis, and we will use the `math.isclose` function to verify that our implementation is correct.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The angle of a complex number can be determined using the arctangent function. For a complex number represented as `x + yi`, the angle can be calculated using the formula `atan2(y, x)`, where `y` is the imaginary part and `x` is the real part. This function will return the angle in radians, which is what we need.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function angle_complex(real, imag):\n       return atan2(imag, real)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This function calculates the angle of a complex number\n# represented by its real and imaginary parts.\ndef angle_complex(real, imag):\n    # Use atan2 to calculate the angle in radians\n    return math.atan2(imag, real)\n\n# The function is defined as required, and it calculates the angle\n# of the complex number using the arctangent of the imaginary part\n# over the real part.\n```",
