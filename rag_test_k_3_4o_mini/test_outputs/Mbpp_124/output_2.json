Here\u2019s the corrected implementation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This function calculates the angle of a complex number\n# represented by its real and imaginary parts.\ndef angle_complex(real, imag):\n    # Use atan2 to calculate the angle in radians\n    return math.atan2(imag, real)\n\n# The function is defined as required, and it calculates the angle\n# of the complex number using the arctangent of the imaginary part\n# over the real part.\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- The function `angle_complex` takes two arguments: `real` (the real part) and `imag` (the imaginary part).\n- The angle is calculated using `math.atan2(imag, real)`, which correctly computes the angle in radians based on the provided real and imaginary components. \n\nThis should now align with the assertion provided and pass the tests.",
