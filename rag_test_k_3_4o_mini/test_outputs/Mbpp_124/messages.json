   As an example, consider a problem where\n    we are given the vertices of a quadrilateral\n    (a polygon that has four vertices),\n    and our task is to calculate its area.\n    For example, a possible input for the problem is as follows:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (5,6) circle [radius=0.1];\n

One way to approach the problem is to divide\n    the quadrilateral into two triangles by a straight\n    line between two opposite vertices:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (5,6) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (1,1) circle

the areas\n    of the triangles.\n    The area of a triangle can be calculated,\n    for example, using \\key{Heron's formula}\n    %\\footnote{Heron of Alexandria (c. 10--70) was a Greek mathematician.}\n    \\[ \\sqrt{s (s-a) (s-b) (s-c)},\\]\n    where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are the lengths\n    of the triangle's sides and\n    $s=(a+b+c)/2$.\n    \\index{Heron's formula}\n\n    This is a possible way to solve the problem,\n    but there is one pitfall:\n    how to divide the quadrilateral into triangles?\n    It turns out that sometimes we cannot just pick\n    two arbitrary opposite vertices.\n    For example, in the following situation,\n    the division line is \\emph{outside} the quadrilateral:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill]

\\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (3,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (1,1) circle

the lines is the correct\n    choice, but the situation is difficult for a computer.\n                           \n    However, it turns out that we can solve the problem using\n    another method that is more convenient to a programmer.\n    Namely, there is a general formula\n    \\[x_1y_2-x_2y_1+x_2y_3-x_3y_2+x_3y_4-x_4y_3+x_4y_1-x_1y_4,\\]\n    that calculates the area of a quadrilateral\n    whose vertices are\n    $(x_1,y_1)$,\n    $(x_2,y_2)$,\n    $(x_3,y_3)$ and\n    $(x_4,y_4)$.\n    This formula is easy to implement, there are no special\n    cases, and we can even generalize the formula\n    to \\emph{all} polygons.\n\n    \\section{Complex numbers}\n\n    \\index{complex number}\n    \\index{point}\n    \\index{vector}\n\n    A \\key{complex number} is a number of the form $x+y i$,\n    where $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the \\key{imaginary unit}.\n    A geometric interpretation of a complex number is\n    that it represents a two-dimensional point $(x,y)$\n    or a vector from the origin to a point $(x,y)$.\n\n    For example, $4+2i$ corresponds to the\n    following point and vector:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[->,thick] (-5,0)--(5,0);\n    \\draw[->,thick] (0,-5)--(0,5);\n\n    \\draw[fill] (4,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[->,thick] (0,0)--(4-0.1,2-0.1);\n\n    \\node at (4,2.8) {$(4,2)$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\index{complex@\\texttt{complex}}\n\n    The C++ complex number class \\texttt{complex} is\n    useful when solving geometric problems.\n    Using the class we can represent points and vectors\n    as complex numbers, and the class contains tools\n    that are useful in geometry.\n\n    In the following code, \\texttt{C} is the type of\n    a coordinate and \\texttt{P} is the type of a point or a vector.\n    In addition, the code defines macros \\texttt{X} and \\texttt{Y}\n    that can be used to refer to x and y coordinates.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    typedef long long C;\n    typedef complex<C> P;\n    #define X real()\n    #define Y imag()\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    For example, the following code defines a point $p=(4,2)$\n    and prints its x and y coordinates:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P p = {4,2};\n    cout << p.X << \" \" << p.Y << \"\\n\"; // 4 2\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The following code defines vectors $v=(3,1)$ and $u=(2,2)$,\n    and after that calculates the sum $s=v+u$.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P v = {3,1};\n    P u = {2,2};\n    P s = v+u;\n    cout << s.X << \" \" << s.Y << \"\\n\"; // 5 3\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    In practice,\n    an appropriate coordinate type is usually\n    \\texttt{long long} (integer) or \\texttt{long double}\n    (real number).\n    It is a good idea to use integer whenever possible,\n    because calculations with integers are exact.\n    If real numbers are needed,\n    precision errors should be taken into account\n    when comparing numbers.\n    A safe way to check if real numbers $a$ and $b$ are equal\n    is to compare them using $|a-b|<\\epsilon$,\n    where $\\epsilon$ is a small number (for example, $\\epsilon=10^{-9}$).\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Functions}\n\n    In the following examples, the coordinate type is\n    \\texttt{long double}.\n\n    The function $\\texttt{abs}(v)$ calculates the length\n    $|v|$ of a vector $v=(x,y)$\n    using the formula $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.\n    The function can also be used for\n    calculating the distance between points\n    $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$,\n    because that distance equals the length\n    of the vector $(x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1)$.\n\n    The following code calculates the distance\n    between points $(4,2)$ and $(3,-1)$:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P a = {4,2};\n    P b = {3,-1};\n    cout << abs(b-a) << \"\\n\"; // 3.16228\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function $\\texttt{arg}(v)$ calculates the\n    angle of a vector $v=(x,y)$ with respect to the x axis.\n    The function gives the angle in radians,\n    where $r$ radians equals $180 r/\\pi$ degrees.\n    The angle of a vector that points to the right is 0,\n    and angles decrease clockwise and increase\n    counterclockwise.\n\n    The function $\\texttt{polar}(s,a)$ constructs a vector\n    whose length is $s$ and that points to an angle $a$.\n    A vector can be rotated by an angle $a$\n    by multiplying it by a vector with length 1 and angle $a$.\n\n    The following code calculates the angle of\n    the vector $(4,2)$, rotates it $1/2$ radians\n    counterclockwise, and then calculates the angle again:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P v = {4,2};\n    cout << arg(v) << \"\\n\"; // 0.463648\n    v *= polar(1.0,0.5);\n    cout << arg(v) << \"\\n\"; // 0.963648\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Finding the equation of a line for a segment\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Finding the equation of a line for a segment\n\n    The task is: given the coordinates of the ends of a segment, construct a line passing through it.\n\n    We assume that the segment is non-degenerate, i.e. has a length greater than zero (otherwise, of course, infinitely many different lines pass through it).\n\n    ### Two-dimensional case\n\n    Let the given segment be $PQ$ i.e. the known coordinates of its ends $P_x , P_y , Q_x , Q_y$ .\n\n    It is necessary to construct **the equation of a line in the plane** passing through this segment, i.e. find the coefficients $A , B , C$ in the equation of a line:\n\n    $$A x + B y + C = 0.$$\n\n    Note that for the required triples $(A, B, C)$ there are **infinitely many** solutions which describe the given segment:\n    you can multiply all three coefficients by an arbitrary non-zero number and get the same straight line.\n    Therefore, our task is to find one of these triples.\n\n    It is easy to verify (by substitution of these expressions and the coordinates of the points $P$ and $Q$ into the equation of a straight line) that the following set of coefficients fits:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    A &= P_y - Q_y, \\\\\n    B &= Q_x - P_x, \\\\\n    C &= - A P_x - B P_y.\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    ### Integer case\n\n    An important advantage of this method of constructing a straight line is that if the coordinates of the ends were integer, then the coefficients obtained will also be **integer** . In some cases, this allows one to perform geometric operations without resorting to real numbers at all.\n\n    However, there is a small drawback: for the same straight line different triples of coefficients can be obtained.\n    To avoid this, but do not go away from the integer coefficients, you can apply the following technique, often called **rationing**. Find the [greatest common divisor](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md) of numbers $| A | , | B | , | C |$ , we divide all three coefficients by it, and then we make the normalization of the sign: if $A <0$ or $A = 0, B <0$ then multiply all three coefficients by $-1$ .\n    As a result, we will come to the conclusion that for identical straight lines, identical triples of coefficients will be obtained, which makes it easy to check straight lines for equality.\n\n    ### Real case\n\n    When working with real numbers, you should always be aware of errors.\n\n    The coefficients $A$ and $B$ will have the order of the original coordinates, the coefficient $C$ is of the order of the square of them. This may already be quite large numbers, and, for example, when we [intersect straight lines](lines-intersection.md), they will become even larger, which can lead to large rounding errors already when the coordinates of the end points are of order $10^3$.\n\n    Therefore, when working with real numbers, it is desirable to produce the so-called **normalization**, this is straightforward: namely, to make the coefficients such that $A ^ 2 + B ^ 2 = 1$ . To do this, calculate the number $Z$ :\n\n    $$Z = \\sqrt{A ^ 2 + B ^ 2},$$\n\n    and divide all three coefficients $A , B , C$ by it.\n\n    Thus, the order of the coefficients $A$ and $B$ will not depend on the order of the input coordinates, and the coefficient $C$ will be of the same order as the input coordinates. In practice, this leads to a significant improvement in the accuracy of calculations.\n\n    Finally, we mention the **comparison** of straight lines - in fact, after such a normalization, for the same straight line, only two triples of coefficients can be obtained: up to multiplication by $-1$.\n    Accordingly, if we make an additional normalization taking into account the sign (if $A < -\\varepsilon$  or $| A | < \\varepsilon$, $B <- \\varepsilon$ then multiply by $-1$ ), the resulting coefficients will be unique.\n\n    ### Three-dimensional and multidimensional case\n\n    Already in the three-dimensional case there is **no simple equation** describing a straight line (it can be defined as the intersection of two planes, that is, a system of two equations, but this is an inconvenient method).\n\n    Consequently, in the three-dimensional and multidimensional cases we must use the **parametric method of defining a straight line** , i.e. as a point $p$ and a vector $v$ :\n\n    $$p + v t, ~~~ t \\in \\mathbb{R}.$$\n\n    Those. a straight line is all points that can be obtained from a point $p$ adding a vector $v$ with an arbitrary coefficient.\n\n    The **construction** of a straight line in a parametric form along the coordinates of the ends of a segment is trivial, we just take one end of the segment for the point $p$, and the vector from the first to the second end \u2014 for the vector $v$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Circle-Circle Intersection\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Circle-Circle Intersection\n\n    You are given two circles on a 2D plane, each one described as coordinates of its center and its radius. Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).\n\n    ## Solution\n\n    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).\n\n    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:\n\n    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$\n\n    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$\n\n    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:\n\n    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$\n\n    $$x \\cdot (-2x_2) + y \\cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$\n\n    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:\n\n    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    A &= -2x_2 \\\\\n    B &= -2y_2 \\\\\n    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).\n\n    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

formula\n    to \\emph{all} polygons.\n\n    \\section{Complex numbers}\n\n    \\index{complex number}\n    \\index{point}\n    \\index{vector}\n\n    A \\key{complex number} is a number of the form $x+y i$,\n    where $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the \\key{imaginary unit}.\n    A geometric interpretation of a complex number is\n    that it represents a two-dimensional point $(x,y)$\n    or a vector from the origin to a point $(x,y)$.\n\n    For example, $4+2i$ corresponds to the\n    following point and vector:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[->,thick] (-5,0)--(5,0);\n    \\draw[->,thick] (0,-5)--(0,5);\n\n    \\draw[fill] (4,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[->,thick] (0,0)--(4-0.1,2-0.1);\n\n    \\node at (4,2.8) {$(4,2)$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\index{complex@\\texttt{complex}}\n\n    The C++ complex number class \\texttt{complex} is\n    useful when solving geometric problems.\n    Using the class we can represent points and vectors\n    as complex numbers, and the class contains tools\n    that are useful in geometry.\n\n    In the following code, \\texttt{C} is the type of\n    a coordinate and \\texttt{P} is the type of a point or a vector.\n    In addition, the code defines macros \\texttt{X} and \\texttt{Y}\n    that can be used to refer to x and y coordinates.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    typedef long long C;\n    typedef complex<C> P;\n    #define X real()\n    #define Y imag()\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    For example, the following code defines a point $p=(4,2)$\n    and prints its x and y coordinates:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P p = {4,2};\n    cout << p.X << \" \" << p.Y << \"\\n\"; // 4 2\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The following code defines vectors $v=(3,1)$ and $u=(2,2)$,\n    and after that calculates the sum $s=v+u$.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P v = {3,1};\n    P u = {2,2};\n    P s = v+u;\n    cout << s.X << \" \" << s.Y << \"\\n\"; // 5 3\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    In practice,\n    an appropriate coordinate type is usually\n    \\texttt{long long} (integer) or \\texttt{long double}\n    (real number).\n    It is a good idea to use integer whenever possible,\n    because calculations with integers are exact.\n    If real numbers are needed,\n    precision errors should be taken into account\n    when comparing numbers.\n    A safe way to check if real numbers $a$ and $b$ are equal\n    is to compare them using $|a-b|<\\epsilon$,\n    where $\\epsilon$ is a small number (for example, $\\epsilon=10^{-9}$).\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Functions}\n\n    In the following examples, the coordinate type is\n    \\texttt{long double}.\n\n    The function $\\texttt{abs}(v)$ calculates the length\n    $|v|$ of a vector $v=(x,y)$\n    using the formula $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.\n    The function can also be used for\n    calculating the distance between points\n    $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$,\n    because that distance equals the length\n    of the vector $(x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1)$.\n\n    The following code calculates the distance\n    between points $(4,2)$ and $(3,-1)$:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P a = {4,2};\n    P b = {3,-1};\n    cout << abs(b-a) << \"\\n\"; // 3.16228\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function $\\texttt{arg}(v)$ calculates the\n    angle of a vector $v=(x,y)$ with respect to the x axis.\n    The function gives the angle in radians,\n    where $r$ radians equals $180 r/\\pi$ degrees.\n    The angle of a vector that points to the right is 0,\n    and angles decrease clockwise and increase\n    counterclockwise.\n\n    The function $\\texttt{polar}(s,a)$ constructs a vector\n    whose length is $s$ and that points to an angle $a$.\n    A vector can be rotated by an angle $a$\n    by multiplying it by a vector with length 1 and angle $a$.\n\n    The following code calculates the angle of\n    the vector $(4,2)$, rotates it $1/2$ radians\n    counterclockwise, and then calculates the angle again:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P v = {4,2};\n    cout << arg(v) << \"\\n\"; // 0.463648\n    v *= polar(1.0,0.5);\n    cout << arg(v) << \"\\n\"; // 0.963648\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Fast Fourier transform\n    Part: 5/5\n    ```\n\n    Here the function `inverse` computes the modular inverse (see [Modular Multiplicative Inverse](module-inverse.md)).\n    The constants `mod`, `root`, `root_pw` determine the module and the root, and `root_1` is the inverse of `root` modulo `mod`.\n\n    In practice this implementation is slower than the implementation using complex numbers (due to the huge number of modulo operations), but it has some advantages such as less memory usage and no rounding errors.\n\n    ## Multiplication with arbitrary modulus\n\n    Here we want to achieve the same goal as in previous section.\n    Multiplying two polynomial $A(x)$ and $B(x)$, and computing the coefficients modulo some number $M$.\n    The number theoretic transform only works for certain prime numbers.\n    What about the case when the modulus is not of the desired form?\n\n    One option would be to perform multiple number theoretic transforms with different prime numbers of the form $c 2^k + 1$, then apply the [Chinese Remainder Theorem](chinese-remainder-theorem.md) to compute the final coefficients.\n\n    Another options is to distribute the polynomials $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ into two smaller polynomials each\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    A(x) &= A_1(x) + A_2(x) \\cdot C \\\\\n    B(x) &= B_1(x) + B_2(x) \\cdot C\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    with $C \\approx \\sqrt{M}$.\n\n    Then the product of $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ can then be represented as:\n\n    $$A(x) \\cdot B(x) = A_1(x) \\cdot B_1(x) + \\left(A_1(x) \\cdot B_2(x) + A_2(x) \\cdot B_1(x)\\right)\\cdot C + \\left(A_2(x) \\cdot B_2(x)\\right)\\cdot C^2$$\n\n    The polynomials $A_1(x)$, $A_2(x)$, $B_1(x)$ and $B_2(x)$ contain only coefficients smaller than $\\sqrt{M}$, therefore the coefficients of all the appearing products are smaller than $M \\cdot n$, which is usually small enough to handle with typical floating point types.\n\n    This approach therefore requires computing the products of polynomials with smaller coefficients (by using the normal FFT and inverse FFT), and then the original product can be restored using modular addition and multiplication in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    ## Applications\n\n    DFT can be used in a huge variety of other problems, which at the first glance have nothing to do with multiplying polynomials.\n\n    ### All possible sums\n\n    We are given two arrays $a[]$ and $b[]$.\n    We have to find all possible sums $a[i] + b[j]$, and for each sum count how often it appears.\n\n    For example for $a = [1,~ 2,~ 3]$ and $b = [2,~ 4]$ we get:\n    then sum $3$ can be obtained in $1$ way, the sum $4$ also in $1$ way, $5$ in $2$, $6$ in $1$, $7$ in $1$.\n\n    We construct for the arrays $a$ and $b$ two polynomials $A$ and $B$.\n    The numbers of the array will act as the exponents in the polynomial ($a[i] \\Rightarrow x^{a[i]}$); and the coefficients of this term will be how often the number appears in the array.\n\n    Then, by multiplying these two polynomials in $O(n \\log n)$ time, we get a polynomial $C$, where the exponents will tell us which sums can be obtained, and the coefficients tell us how often.\n    To demonstrate this on the example:\n\n    $$(1 x^1 + 1 x^2 + 1 x^3) (1 x^2 + 1 x^4) = 1 x^3 + 1 x^4 + 2 x^5 + 1 x^6 + 1 x^7$$\n\n    ### All possible scalar products\n\n    We are given two arrays $a[]$ and $b[]$ of length $n$.\n    We have to compute the products of $a$ with every cyclic shift of $b$.\n\n    We generate two new arrays of size $2n$:\n    We reverse $a$ and append $n$ zeros to it.\n    And we just append $b$ to itself.\n    When we multiply these two arrays as polynomials, and look at the coefficients $c[n-1],~ c[n],~ \\dots,~ c[2n-2]$ of the product $c$, we get:\n\n    $$c[k] = \\sum_{i+j=k} a[i] b[j]$$\n\n    And since all the elements $a[i] = 0$ for $i \\ge n$:\n\n    $$c[k] = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a[i] b[k-i]$$\n\n    It is easy to see that this sum is just the scalar product of the vector $a$ with the $(k - (n - 1))$-th cyclic left shift of $b$.\n    Thus these coefficients are the answer to the problem, and we were still able to obtain it in $O(n \\log n)$ time.\n    Note here that $c[2n-1]$ also gives us the $n$-th cyclic shift but that is the same as the $0$-th cyclic shift so we don't need to consider that separately into our answer.\n\n    ### Two stripes\n\n    We are given two Boolean stripes (cyclic arrays of values $0$ and $1$) $a$ and $b$.\n    We want to find all ways to attach the first stripe to the second one, such that at no position we have a $1$ of the first stripe next to a $1$ of the second stripe.\n\n    The problem doesn't actually differ much from the previous problem.\n    Attaching two stripes just means that we perform a cyclic shift on the second array, and we can attach the two stripes, if scalar product of the two arrays is $0$.\n\n    ### String matching\n\n    We are given two strings, a text $T$ and a pattern $P$, consisting of lowercase letters.\n    We have to compute all the occurrences of the pattern in the text.\n\n    We create a polynomial for each string ($T[i]$ and $P[I]$ are numbers between $0$ and $25$ corresponding to the $26$ letters of the alphabet):\n\n    $$A(x) = a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + \\dots + a_{n-1} x^{n-1}, \\quad n = |T|$$\n\n    with\n\n    $$a_i = \\cos(\\alpha_i) + i \\sin(\\alpha_i), \\quad \\alpha_i = \\frac{2 \\pi T[i]}{26}.$$\n\n    And\n\n    $$B(x) = b_0 x^0 + b_1 x^1 + \\dots + b_{m-1} x^{m-1}, \\quad m = |P|$$\n\n    with\n\n    $$b_i = \\cos(\\beta_i) - i \\sin(\\beta_i), \\quad \\beta_i = \\frac{2 \\pi P[m-i-1]}{26}.$$\n\n    Notice that with the expression $P[m-i-1]$ explicitly reverses the pattern.\n\n    The $(m-1+i)$th coefficients of the product of the two polynomials $C(x) = A(x) \\cdot B(x)$ will tell us, if the pattern appears in the text at position $i$.\n\n    $$c_{m-1+i} = \\sum_{j = 0}^{m-1} a_{i+j} \\cdot b_{m-1-j} = \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\left(\\cos(\\alpha_{i+j}) + i \\sin(\\alpha_{i+j})\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\cos(\\beta_j) - i \\sin(\\beta_j)\\right)$$\n\n    with $\\alpha_{i+j} = \\frac{2 \\pi T[i+j]}{26}$ and $\\beta_j = \\frac{2 \\pi P[j]}{26}$\n\n    If there is a match, than $T[i+j] = P[j]$, and therefore $\\alpha_{i+j} = \\beta_j$.\n    This gives (using the Pythagorean trigonometric identity):\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    c_{m-1+i} &= \\sum_{j = 0}^{m-1}  \\left(\\cos(\\alpha_{i+j}) + i \\sin(\\alpha_{i+j})\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\cos(\\alpha_{i+j}) - i \\sin(\\alpha_{i+j})\\right) \\\\\n    &= \\sum_{j = 0}^{m-1} \\cos(\\alpha_{i+j})^2 + \\sin(\\alpha_{i+j})^2 = \\sum_{j = 0}^{m-1} 1 = m\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    If there isn't a match, then at least a character is different, which leads that one of the products $a_{i+1} \\cdot b_{m-1-j}$ is not equal to $1$, which leads to the coefficient $c_{m-1+i} \\ne m$.\n\n    ### String matching with wildcards\n\n    This is an extension of the previous problem.\n    This time we allow that the pattern contains the wildcard character $\\*$, which can match every possible letter.\n    E.g. the pattern $a*c$ appears in the text $abccaacc$ at exactly three positions, at index $0$, index $4$ and index $5$.\n\n    We create the exact same polynomials, except that we set $b_i = 0$ if $P[m-i-1] = *$.\n    If $x$ is the number of wildcards in $P$, then we will have a match of $P$ in $T$ at index $i$ if $c_{m-1+i} = m - x$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Circle-Circle Intersection\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Circle-Circle Intersection\n\n    You are given two circles on a 2D plane, each one described as coordinates of its center and its radius. Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).\n\n    ## Solution\n\n    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).\n\n    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:\n\n    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$\n\n    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$\n\n    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:\n\n    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$\n\n    $$x \\cdot (-2x_2) + y \\cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$\n\n    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:\n\n    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    A &= -2x_2 \\\\\n    B &= -2y_2 \\\\\n    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).\n\n    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

problems, it is often challenging\n    to find a way to approach the problem so that\n    the solution to the problem can be conveniently implemented\n    and the number of special cases is small.\n\n    As an example, consider a problem where\n    we are given the vertices of a quadrilateral\n    (a polygon that has four vertices),\n    and our task is to calculate its area.\n    For example, a possible input for the problem is as follows:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (5,6) circle [radius=0.1];\n

One way to approach the problem is to divide\n    the quadrilateral into two triangles by a straight\n    line between two opposite vertices:\n    \\begin{center}\n

the lines is the correct\n    choice, but the situation is difficult for a computer.\n                           \n    However, it turns out that we can solve the problem using\n    another method that is more convenient to a programmer.\n    Namely, there is a general formula\n    \\[x_1y_2-x_2y_1+x_2y_3-x_3y_2+x_3y_4-x_4y_3+x_4y_1-x_1y_4,\\]\n    that calculates the area of a quadrilateral\n    whose vertices are\n    $(x_1,y_1)$,\n    $(x_2,y_2)$,\n    $(x_3,y_3)$ and\n    $(x_4,y_4)$.\n    This formula is easy to implement, there are no special\n    cases, and we can even generalize the formula\n    to \\emph{all} polygons.\n\n    \\section{Complex numbers}\n\n    \\index{complex number}\n    \\index{point}\n    \\index{vector}\n\n    A \\key{complex number} is a number of the form $x+y i$,\n    where $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the \\key{imaginary unit}.\n    A geometric interpretation of a complex number is\n    that it represents a two-dimensional point $(x,y)$\n    or a vector from the origin to a point $(x,y)$.\n\n    For example, $4+2i$ corresponds to the\n    following point and vector:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[->,thick] (-5,0)--(5,0);\n    \\draw[->,thick] (0,-5)--(0,5);\n\n    \\draw[fill] (4,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[->,thick] (0,0)--(4-0.1,2-0.1);\n\n    \\node at (4,2.8) {$(4,2)$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\index{complex@\\texttt{complex}}\n\n    The C++ complex number class \\texttt{complex} is\n    useful when solving geometric problems.\n    Using the class we can represent points and vectors\n    as complex numbers, and the class contains tools\n    that are useful in geometry.\n\n    In the following code, \\texttt{C} is the type of\n    a coordinate and \\texttt{P} is the type of a point or a vector.\n    In addition, the code defines macros \\texttt{X} and \\texttt{Y}\n    that can be used to refer to x and y coordinates.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    typedef long long C;\n    typedef complex<C> P;\n    #define X real()\n    #define Y imag()\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    For example, the following code defines a point $p=(4,2)$\n    and prints its x and y coordinates:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P p = {4,2};\n    cout << p.X << \" \" << p.Y << \"\\n\"; // 4 2\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The following code defines vectors $v=(3,1)$ and $u=(2,2)$,\n    and after that calculates the sum $s=v+u$.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P v = {3,1};\n    P u = {2,2};\n    P s = v+u;\n    cout << s.X << \" \" << s.Y << \"\\n\"; // 5 3\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    In practice,\n    an appropriate coordinate type is usually\n    \\texttt{long long} (integer) or \\texttt{long double}\n    (real number).\n    It is a good idea to use integer whenever possible,\n    because calculations with integers are exact.\n    If real numbers are needed,\n    precision errors should be taken into account\n    when comparing numbers.\n    A safe way to check if real numbers $a$ and $b$ are equal\n    is to compare them using $|a-b|<\\epsilon$,\n    where $\\epsilon$ is a small number (for example, $\\epsilon=10^{-9}$).\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Functions}\n\n    In the following examples, the coordinate type is\n    \\texttt{long double}.\n\n    The function $\\texttt{abs}(v)$ calculates the length\n    $|v|$ of a vector $v=(x,y)$\n    using the formula $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.\n    The function can also be used for\n    calculating the distance between points\n    $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$,\n    because that distance equals the length\n    of the vector $(x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1)$.\n\n    The following code calculates the distance\n    between points $(4,2)$ and $(3,-1)$:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P a = {4,2};\n    P b = {3,-1};\n    cout << abs(b-a) << \"\\n\"; // 3.16228\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function $\\texttt{arg}(v)$ calculates the\n    angle of a vector $v=(x,y)$ with respect to the x axis.\n    The function gives the angle in radians,\n    where $r$ radians equals $180 r/\\pi$ degrees.\n    The angle of a vector that points to the right is 0,\n    and angles decrease clockwise and increase\n    counterclockwise.\n\n    The function $\\texttt{polar}(s,a)$ constructs a vector\n    whose length is $s$ and that points to an angle $a$.\n    A vector can be rotated by an angle $a$\n    by multiplying it by a vector with length 1 and angle $a$.\n\n    The following code calculates the angle of\n    the vector $(4,2)$, rotates it $1/2$ radians\n    counterclockwise, and then calculates the angle again:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P v = {4,2};\n    cout << arg(v) << \"\\n\"; // 0.463648\n    v *= polar(1.0,0.5);\n    cout << arg(v) << \"\\n\"; // 0.963648\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Circle-Circle Intersection\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Circle-Circle Intersection\n\n    You are given two circles on a 2D plane, each one described as coordinates of its center and its radius. Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).\n\n    ## Solution\n\n    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).\n\n    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:\n\n    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$\n\n    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$\n\n    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:\n\n    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$\n\n    $$x \\cdot (-2x_2) + y \\cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$\n\n    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:\n\n    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    A &= -2x_2 \\\\\n    B &= -2y_2 \\\\\n    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).\n\n    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Finding common tangents to two circles\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Finding common tangents to two circles\n\n    Given two circles. It is required to find all their common tangents, i.e. all such lines that touch both circles simultaneously.\n\n    The described algorithm will also work in the case when one (or both) circles degenerate into points. Thus, this algorithm can also be used to find tangents to a circle passing through a given point.\n\n\n    ## The number of common tangents\n    The number of common tangents to two circles can be **0,1,2,3,4** and **infinite**.\n    Look at the images for different cases.\n    <center>![\"Different cases of tangents common to two circles\"](tangents-to-two-circles.png)</center>\n\n    Here, we won't be considering **degenerate** cases, i.e *when the circles coincide (in this case they have infinitely many common tangents), or one circle lies inside the other (in this case they have no common tangents, or if the circles are tangent, there is one common tangent).*\n\n    In most cases, two circles have **four** common tangents.\n\n    If the circles **are tangent** , then they will have three common tangents, but this can be understood as a degenerate case: as if the two tangents coincided.\n\n    Moreover, the algorithm described below will work in the case when one or both circles have zero radius: in this case there will be, respectively, two or one common tangent.\n\n    Summing up, we will always look for **four tangents** for all cases except infinite tangents case (The infinite tangents case needs to be handled separately and it is not discussed here). In degenerate cases, some of tangents will coincide, but nevertheless, these cases will also fit into the big picture.\n\n\n\n    ## Algorithm\n    For the sake of simplicity of the algorithm, we will assume, without losing generality, that the center of the first circle has coordinates $(0, 0)$. (If this is not the case, then this can be achieved by simply shifting the whole picture, and after finding a solution, by shifting the obtained straight lines back.)\n\n    Denote $r_1$ and $r_2$ the radii of the first and second circles, and by $(v_x,v_y)$ the coordinates of the center of the second circle and point $v$ different from origin. (Note: we are not considering the case in which both the circles are same).\n\n    To solve the problem, we approach it purely **algebraically** . We need to find all the lines of the form $ax + by + c = 0$ that lie at a distance $r_1$ from the origin of coordinates, and at a distance $r_2$ from a point $v$. In addition, we impose the condition of normalization of the straight line: the sum of the squares of the coefficients and must be equal to one (this is necessary, otherwise the same straight line will correspond to infinitely many representations of the form $ax + by + c = 0$). Total we get such a system of equations for the desired $a, b, c$:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    a^2 + b^2 &= 1 \\\\\n    \\mid a \\cdot 0 + b \\cdot 0 + c \\mid &= r_1 \\\\\n    \\mid a \\cdot v_x + b \\cdot v_y + c \\mid &= r_2\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    To get rid of the modulus, note that there are only four ways to open the modulus in this system. All these methods can be considered by the general case, if we understand the opening of the modulus as the fact that the coefficient on the right-hand side may be multiplied by -1. In other words, we turn to this system:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    a^2 + b^2 &= 1 \\\\\n    c &= \\pm r_1 \\\\\n    a \\cdot v_x + b \\cdot v_y + c &= \\pm r_2\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n\n    Entering the notation $d_1 = \\pm r_1$ and $d_2 = \\pm r_2$ , we come to the conclusion that the system must have four solutions:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    a^2 + b^2 &= 1 \\\\\n    c &= d_1 \\\\\n    a \\cdot v_x + b \\cdot v_y + c &= d_2\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    The solution of this system is reduced to solving a quadratic equation. We will omit all the cumbersome calculations, and immediately give a ready answer:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    a &= {( d_2 - d_1 ) v_x \\pm v_y \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2-(d_2-d_1)^2} \\over {v_x^2 + v_y^2} } \\\\\n    b &= {( d_2 - d_1 ) v_y \\pm v_x \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2-(d_2-d_1)^2} \\over {v_x^2 + v_y^2} } \\\\\n    c &= d_1\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    Total we got eight solutions instead four. However, it is easy to understand where superfluous decisions arise: in fact, in the latter system, it is enough to take only one solution (for example, the first). In fact, the geometric meaning of what we take $\\pm r_1$ and $\\pm r_2$ is clear: we are actually sorting out which side of each circle there is a straight line. Therefore, the two methods that arise when solving the latter system are redundant: it is enough to choose one of the two solutions (only, of course, in all four cases, you must choose the same family of solutions).\n\n    The last thing that we have not yet considered is **how to shift the straight lines** in the case when the first circle was not originally located at the origin. However, everything is simple here: it follows from the linearity of the equation of a straight line that the value $a \\cdot x_0 + b \\cdot y_0$ (where $x_0$ and $y_0$ are the coordinates of the original center of the first circle) must be subtracted from the coefficient $c$.\n\n    ##Implementation\n    We first describe all the necessary data structures and other auxiliary definitions:\n\n    ```point-line-circle-struct\n    struct pt {\n        double x, y;\n\n        pt operator- (pt p) {\n            pt res = { x-p.x, y-p.y };\n            return res;\n        }\n    };\n\n    struct circle : pt {\n        double r;\n    };\n\n    struct line {\n        double a, b, c;\n    };\n\n    const double EPS = 1E-9;\n\n    double sqr (double a) {\n        return a * a;\n    }\n    ```\n    Then the solution itself can be written this way (where the main function for the call is the second; and the first function is an auxiliary):\n\n    ```find-tangents-to-two-circles\n    void tangents (pt c, double r1, double r2, vector<line> & ans) {\n        double r = r2 - r1;\n        double z = sqr(c.x) + sqr(c.y);\n        double d = z - sqr(r);\n        if (d < -EPS)  return;\n        d = sqrt (abs (d));\n        line l;\n        l.a = (c.x * r + c.y * d) / z;\n        l.b = (c.y * r - c.x * d) / z;\n        l.c = r1;\n        ans.push_back (l);\n    }\n\n    vector<line> tangents (circle a, circle b) {\n        vector<line> ans;\n        for (int i=-1; i<=1; i+=2)\n            for (int j=-1; j<=1; j+=2)\n                tangents (b-a, a.r*i, b.r*j, ans);\n        for (size_t i=0; i<ans.size(); ++i)\n            ans[i].c -= ans[i].a * a.x + ans[i].b * a.y;\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
