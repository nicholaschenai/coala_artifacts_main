    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that checks if the product of all numbers in a given list is even. If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if the product of numbers in a list is even, we can simply check if any of the numbers in the list is even. If at least one number is even, the product will be even. If all numbers are odd, the product will be odd. Therefore, we can iterate through the list and check each number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_product_even(numbers):\n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_product_even(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If we find an even number, the product is even\n            return True\n    # If no even number is found, the product is odd\n    return False\n```",
