(In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).\n\n    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):\n\n     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \\ldots$\n\n    ### Application in some combinatorial problems\n\n    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for\n\n    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.\n    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.\n    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.\n    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).\n    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.\n    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).\n    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \\times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).\n    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).\n    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.\n    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \\ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).\n\n\n    ## Calculations\n\n    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.\n\n    ### Recursive formula\n \n    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$\n\n    $$C_n = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \\geq 2$$\n\n    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.\n\n    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :\n\n    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    #### C++ implementation \n\n    ```cpp\n    const int MOD = ....\n    const int MAX = ....\n    int catalan[MAX];\n    void init() {\n        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;\n        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {\n            catalan[i] = 0;\n            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {\n                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;\n                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {\n                    catalan[i] -= MOD;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Analytical formula\n\n    $$C_n = \\frac{1}{n + 1} {\\binom{2n}{n}}$$\n\n    (here $\\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).\n\n    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \\times n$ is given by $\\binom{2n}{n}$.\n\n    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \\times n$.\n\n    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ are $\\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as \"bad\" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above \"bad\" paths, obtaining the formula:\n\n    $$C_n = \\binom{2n}{n} - \\binom{2n}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\binom{2n}{n} , {n} \\geq 0$$\n\n    ## Reference\n\n    - [Catalan Number by Tom Davis](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/catalan.pdf)\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Combinatorics\n    Section: Catalan numbers\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Catalan numbers}\n\n    \\index{Catalan number}\n\n    The \\key{Catalan number}\n    %\\footnote{E. C. Catalan (1814--1894) was a Belgian mathematician.}\n    $C_n$ equals the\n    number of valid\n    parenthesis expressions that consist of\n    $n$ left parentheses and $n$ right parentheses.\n\n    For example, $C_3=5$, because\n    we can construct the following parenthesis\n    expressions using three\n    left and right parentheses:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]\n    \\item \\texttt{()()()}\n    \\item \\texttt{(())()}\n    \\item \\texttt{()(())}\n    \\item \\texttt{((()))}\n    \\item \\texttt{(()())}\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Parenthesis expressions}\n\n    \\index{parenthesis expression}\n\n    What is exactly a \\emph{valid parenthesis expression}?\n    The following rules precisely define all\n    valid parenthesis expressions:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item An empty parenthesis expression is valid.\n    \\item If an expression $A$ is valid,\n    then also the expression\n    \\texttt{(}$A$\\texttt{)} is valid.\n    \\item If expressions $A$ and $B$ are valid,\n    then also the expression $AB$ is valid.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    Another way to characterize valid \n    parenthesis expressions is that if\n    we choose any prefix of such an expression,\n    it has to contain at least as many left\n    parentheses as right parentheses.\n    In addition, the complete expression has to\n    contain an equal number of left and right\n    parentheses.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 1}\n\n    Catalan numbers can be calculated using the formula\n    \\[ C_n = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_{i} C_{n-i-1}.\\]\n\n    The sum goes through the ways to divide the\n    expression into two parts\n    such that both parts are valid\n    expressions and the first part is as short as possible\n    but not empty.\n    For any $i$, the first part contains $i+1$ pairs\n    of parentheses and the number of expressions\n    is the product of the following values:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $C_{i}$: the number of ways to construct an expression\n    using the parentheses of the first part,\n    not counting the outermost parentheses\n    \\item $C_{n-i-1}$: the number of ways to construct an\n    expression using the parentheses of the second part\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    The base case is $C_0=1$,\n    because we can construct an empty parenthesis\n    expression using zero pairs of parentheses.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 2}\n\n    Catalan numbers can also be calculated\n    using binomial coefficients:\n    \\[ C_n = \\frac{1}{n+1} {2n \\choose n}\\]\n    The formula can be explained as follows:\n\n    There are a total of ${2n \\choose n}$ ways\n    to construct a (not necessarily valid)\n    parenthesis expression that contains $n$ left\n    parentheses and $n$ right parentheses.\n    Let us calculate the number of such\n    expressions that are \\emph{not} valid.\n\n    If a parenthesis expression is not valid,\n    it has to contain a prefix where the\n    number of right parentheses exceeds the\n    number of left parentheses.\n    The idea is to reverse each parenthesis\n    that belongs to such a prefix.\n    For example, the expression\n    \\texttt{())()(} contains a prefix \\texttt{())},\n    and after reversing the prefix,\n    the expression becomes \\texttt{)((()(}.\n\n    The resulting expression consists of $n+1$\n    left parentheses and $n-1$ right parentheses.\n    The number of such expressions is ${2n \\choose n+1}$,\n    which equals the number of non-valid\n    parenthesis expressions.\n    Thus, the number of valid parenthesis\n    expressions can be calculated using the formula\n    \\[{2n \\choose n}-{2n \\choose n+1} = {2n \\choose n} - \\frac{n}{n+1} {2n \\choose n} = \\frac{1}{n+1} {2n \\choose n}.\\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Counting trees}\n\n    Catalan numbers are also related to trees:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item there are $C_n$ binary trees of $n$ nodes\n    \\item there are $C_{n-1}$ rooted trees of $n$ nodes\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\noindent\n    For example, for $C_3=5$, the binary trees are\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (0,0)

counting\n    combinations of objects.\n    Usually, the goal is to find a way to\n    count the combinations efficiently\n    without generating each combination separately.\n\n    As an example, consider the problem\n    of counting the number of ways to\n    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.\n    For example, there are 8 representations\n    for $4$:\n    \\begin{multicols}{2}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $1+1+1+1$\n    \\item $1+1+2$\n    \\item $1+2+1$\n    \\item $2+1+1$\n    \\item $2+2$\n    \\item $3+1$\n    \\item $1+3$\n    \\item $4$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{multicols}\n\n    A combinatorial problem can often be solved\n    using a recursive function.\n    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$\n    that gives the number of representations for $n$.\n    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.\n    The values of the function\n    can be recursively calculated as follows:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n                   1               & n = 0\\\\\n                   f(0)+f(1)+\\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case is $f(0)=1$,\n    because the empty sum represents the number 0.\n    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to\n    choose the first number of the sum.\n    If the first number is $k$,\n    there are $f(n-k)$ representations\n    for the remaining part of the sum.\n    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values\n    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.\n\n    The first values for the function are:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    f(0) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    f(3) & = & 4 \\\\\n    f(4) & = & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced\n    with a closed-form formula.\n    In this problem,\n    \\[\n    f(n)=2^{n-1},\n    \\]\n    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$\n    possible positions for +-signs in the sum\n    and we can choose any subset of them.\n\n    \\section{Binomial coefficients}\n\n    \\index{binomial coefficient}\n\n    The \\key{binomial coefficient} ${n \\choose k}$\n    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset\n    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, ${5 \\choose 3}=10$,\n    because the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:\n    \\[ \\{1,2,3\\}, \\{1,2,4\\}, \\{1,2,5\\}, \\{1,3,4\\}, \\{1,3,5\\}, \n    \\{1,4,5\\}, \\{2,3,4\\}, \\{2,3,5\\}, \\{2,4,5\\}, \\{3,4,5\\} \\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 1}\n\n    Binomial coefficients can be\n    recursively calculated as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k}\n    \\]\n\n    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.\n    If $x$ is included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k-1$\n    elements from $n-1$ elements,\n    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.\n\n    The base cases for the recursion are\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}  =  {n \\choose n} = 1,\n    \\]\n    because there is always exactly\n    one way to construct an empty subset\n    and a subset that contains all the elements.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 2}\n\n    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\n    \\]\n\n    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.\n    We go through all permutations and always\n    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation\n    in the subset.\n    Since the order of the elements in the subset\n    and outside the subset does not matter,\n    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$\n\n    \\subsubsection{Properties}\n\n    For binomial coefficients,\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n \\choose n-k},\n    \\]\n    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into\n    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements\n    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.\n\n    The sum of binomial coefficients is\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}+{n \\choose 1}+{n \\choose 2}+\\ldots+{n \\choose n}=2^n.\n    \\]\n\n    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''\n    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to\n    the $n$th power:\n\n    \\[ (a+b)^n =\n    {n \\choose 0} a^n b^0

can be represented as a string\n    that consists of symbols\n    ''o'' and ''$\\rightarrow$''.\n    Initially, assume that we are standing at the leftmost box.\n    The symbol ''o'' means that we place a ball\n    in the current box, and the symbol\n    ''$\\rightarrow$'' means that we move to\n    the next box to the right.\n\n    Using this notation, each solution is a string\n    that contains $k$ times the symbol ''o'' and\n    $n-1$ times the symbol ''$\\rightarrow$''.\n    For example, the upper-right solution\n    in the above picture corresponds to the string\n    ''$\\rightarrow$ $\\rightarrow$ o $\\rightarrow$ o $\\rightarrow$''.\n    Thus, the number of solutions is\n    ${k+n-1 \\choose k}$.\n\n    \\textit{Scenario 3}: Each box may contain at most one ball,\n    and in addition, no two adjacent boxes may both contain a ball.\n    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The base cases are C(0) = 1 and C(1) = 1. For n >= 2, the nth Catalan number can be computed as the sum of the products of pairs of previous Catalan numbers. Specifically, C(n) = sum(C(k) * C(n-1-k)) for k from 0 to n-1. This means we will need to compute the Catalan numbers iteratively or recursively until we reach the desired nth number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function catalan_number(n):\n       if n == 0 or n == 1:\n           return 1\n       catalan = array of size (n + 1)\n       catalan[0] = 1\n       catalan[1] = 1\n       for i from 2 to n:\n           catalan[i] = 0\n           for j from 0 to i - 1:\n               catalan[i] += catalan[j] * catalan[i - 1 - j]\n       return catalan[n]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef catalan_number(n):\n    # Base cases for the first two Catalan numbers\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Create an array to store the Catalan numbers up to n\n    catalan = [0] * (n + 1)\n    catalan[0] = 1  # C(0) = 1\n    catalan[1] = 1  # C(1) = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the Catalan numbers using the recursive formula\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        catalan[i] = 0\n        for j in range(i):\n            catalan[i] += catalan[j] * catalan[i - 1 - j]\n    \n    # Return the nth Catalan number\n    return catalan[n]\n```"
