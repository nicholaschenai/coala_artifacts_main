    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes three lists as input and returns a new list containing elements that are the same in all three lists at the same index. For example, if the first list has a value of 1 at index 0, the second list has a value of 1 at index 0, and the third list also has a value of 1 at index 0, then 1 should be included in the output list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the indices of the lists. For each index, we will check if the elements in all three lists are equal. If they are, we will add that element to the result list. We will continue this process until we have checked all indices of the lists.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for i from 0 to the length of l1 (or l2 or l3):\n           if l1[i] is equal to l2[i] and l2[i] is equal to l3[i]:\n               append l1[i] to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n    # Create an empty list to store common elements\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(l1)):\n        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists\n        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:\n            # If they are the same, add the element to the result list\n            result.append(l1[i])\n    \n    # Return the list of common elements\n    return result\n```",
