INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/137 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the ratio of zeroes to non-zero integers in a given list of integers. The output should be a floating-point number representing this ratio.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Count the number of zeroes in the list.
   - Count the number of non-zero integers in the list.
   - Calculate the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes by dividing the count of zeroes by the count of non-zeroes.
   - If there are no non-zero integers, we should handle this case to avoid division by zero.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function zero_count(arr):
       initialize zero_count to 0
       initialize non_zero_count to 0
       
       for each number in arr:

    ```

        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\frac{x+y \sqrt{n}}{z}$.

    !!! example "[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)"
        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            x, k = map(int, input().split())

            mod = 10**9+7
        
            # compose (A[0]*x + A[1]) / (A[2]*x + A[3]) and (B[0]*x + B[1]) / (B[2]*x + B[3])

            A = [1, 0, 0, 1] # (x + 0) / (0*x + 1) = x

            a = sqrt(x)

            T = len(a) - 1 # period of a

            # apply ak + 1/x = (ak*x+1)/(1x+0) to (Ax + B) / (Cx + D)

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    # Balanced Ternary

    !["Setun computer using Balanced Ternary system"](https://earltcampbell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/setun.jpeg?w=300)

    This is a non-standard but still positional **numeral system**. Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.
    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,
    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the
    computers utilizing it.

    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:

    ```nohighlight
        0    0
        1    1
        2    1Z
        3    10
        4    11
        5    1ZZ
        6    1Z0
        7    1Z1
        8    10Z
        9    100
    ```

    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.

    ```nohighlight
        -1   Z
        -2   Z1
        -3   Z0
        -4   ZZ
        -5   Z11
    ```

    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.

    ## Conversion algorithm

    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is
    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,
    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -
    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.

    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.

    The final result is `1Z101`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \cdot 1 + 27 \cdot (-1) + 9 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$

    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:

    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$

    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:

    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )
    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.
    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.

    The final result is `100Z10`.

    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:

    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \cdot 1 + 81 \cdot 0 + 27 \cdot 0 + 9 \cdot (-1) + 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$
