    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that determines if a given month (represented by a number from 1 to 12) has 30 days. The function should return `True` if the month has 30 days and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we need to identify which months have 30 days. The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). We can create a list of these month numbers and check if the input month number is in that list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   - Define a function `check_monthnumber_number(month: int) -> bool`.\n   - Create a list of month numbers that have 30 days: `[4, 6, 9, 11]`.\n   - Check if the input `month` is in this list.\n   - Return `True` if it is, otherwise return `False`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to check if a month has 30 days\ndef check_monthnumber_number(month: int) -> bool:\n    # List of months that have 30 days\n    months_with_30_days = [4, 6, 9, 11]\n    # Check if the given month is in the list\n    return month in months_with_30_days\n```",
