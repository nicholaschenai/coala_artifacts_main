possible to solve a problem\n    using either data structures or sorting.\n    Sometimes there are remarkable differences\n    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,\n    which may be hidden in their time complexities.\n\n    Let us consider a problem where\n    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$\n    that both contain $n$ elements.\n    Our task is to calculate the number of elements\n    that belong to both of the lists.\n    For example, for the lists\n    \\[A = [5,2,8,9] \\hspace{10px} \\textrm{and} \\hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\\]\n    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5\n    and 9 belong to both of the lists.\n\n    A straightforward solution to the problem is\n    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,\n    but next we will focus on\n    more efficient algorithms.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,\n    and after this, we iterate through the elements\n    of $B$ and check for each elements if it\n    also belongs to $A$.\n    This is efficient because the elements of $A$\n    are in a set.\n    Using the \\texttt{set} structure,\n    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,\n    so instead of the \\texttt{set} structure\n    we can also use the \\texttt{unordered\\_set} structure.\n    This is an easy way to make the algorithm\n    more efficient, because we only have to change\n    the underlying data structure.\n    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 3}\n\n    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.\n    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.\n    After this, we iterate through both the lists\n    at the same time and find the common elements.\n    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,\n    so the total time complexity is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    The following table shows how efficient\n    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and\n    the elements of the lists are random\n    integers between $1 \\ldots 10^9$:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\\\\n    $2 \\cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\\\\n    $3 \\cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\\\\n    $4 \\cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\\\\n    $5 \\cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that\n    they use different set structures.\n    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on\n    the running time, because Algorithm 2\n    is 4\u20135 times faster than Algorithm 1.\n\n    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3\n    which uses sorting.\n    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.\n    Interestingly, the time complexity of both\n    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.\n    This can be explained by the fact that\n    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done\n    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.\n    On the other hand,\n    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree\n    during the whole algorithm.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: String Hashing\n    Part: 1/2\n    # String Hashing\n\n    Hashing algorithms are helpful in solving a lot of problems.\n\n    We want to solve the problem of comparing strings efficiently.\n    The brute force way of doing so is just to compare the letters of both strings, which has a time complexity of $O(\\min(n_1, n_2))$ if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sizes of the two strings.\n    We want to do better.\n    The idea behind the string hashing is the following: we map each string into an integer and compare those instead of the strings.\n    Doing this allows us to reduce the execution time of the string comparison to $O(1)$.\n\n    For the conversion, we need a so-called **hash function**.\n    The goal of it is to convert a string into an integer, the so-called **hash** of the string.\n    The following condition has to hold: if two strings $s$ and $t$ are equal ($s = t$), then also their hashes have to be equal ($\\text{hash}(s) = \\text{hash}(t)$).\n    Otherwise, we will not be able to compare strings.\n\n    Notice, the opposite direction doesn't have to hold.\n    If the hashes are equal ($\\text{hash}(s) = \\text{hash}(t)$), then the strings do not necessarily have to be equal.\n    E.g. a valid hash function would be simply $\\text{hash}(s) = 0$ for each $s$.\n    Now, this is just a stupid example, because this function will be completely useless, but it is a valid hash function.\n    The reason why the opposite direction doesn't have to hold, is because there are exponentially many strings.\n    If we only want this hash function to distinguish between all strings consisting of lowercase characters of length smaller than 15, then already the hash wouldn't fit into a 64-bit integer (e.g. unsigned long long) any more, because there are so many of them.\n    And of course, we don't want to compare arbitrary long integers, because this will also have the complexity $O(n)$.\n\n    So usually we want the hash function to map strings onto numbers of a fixed range $[0, m)$, then comparing strings is just a comparison of two integers with a fixed length.\n    And of course, we want $\\text{hash}(s) \\neq \\text{hash}(t)$ to be very likely if $s \\neq t$.\n\n    That's the important part that you have to keep in mind.\n    Using hashing will not be 100% deterministically correct, because two complete different strings might have the same hash (the hashes collide).\n    However, in a wide majority of tasks, this can be safely ignored as the probability of the hashes of two different strings colliding is still very small.\n    And we will discuss some techniques in this article how to keep the probability of collisions very low.\n\n    ## Calculation of the hash of a string\n\n    The good and widely used way to define the hash of a string $s$ of length $n$ is\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    \\text{hash}(s) &= s[0] + s[1] \\cdot p + s[2] \\cdot p^2 + ... + s[n-1] \\cdot p^{n-1} \\mod m \\\\\n    &= \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \\cdot p^i \\mod m,\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    where $p$ and $m$ are some chosen, positive numbers.\n    It is called a **polynomial rolling hash function**.\n\n    It is reasonable to make $p$ a prime number roughly equal to the number of characters in the input alphabet.\n    For example, if the input is composed of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, $p = 31$ is a good choice.\n    If the input may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, then $p = 53$ is a possible choice.\n    The code in this article will use $p = 31$.\n\n    Obviously $m$ should be a large number since the probability of two random strings colliding is about $\\approx \\frac{1}{m}$.\n    Sometimes $m = 2^{64}$ is chosen, since then the integer overflows of 64-bit integers work exactly like the modulo operation.\n    However, there exists a method, which generates colliding strings (which work independently from the choice of $p$).\n    So in practice, $m = 2^{64}$ is not recommended.\n    A good choice for $m$ is some large prime number.\n    The code in this article will just use $m = 10^9+9$.\n    This is a large number, but still small enough so that we can perform multiplication of two values using 64-bit integers.\n\n    Here is an example of calculating the hash of a string $s$, which contains only lowercase letters.\n    We convert each character of $s$ to an integer.\n    Here we use the conversion $a \\rightarrow 1$, $b \\rightarrow 2$, $\\dots$, $z \\rightarrow 26$.\n    Converting $a \\rightarrow 0$ is not a good idea, because then the hashes of the strings $a$, $aa$, $aaa$, $\\dots$ all evaluate to $0$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=hashing_function}\n    long long compute_hash(string const& s) {\n        const int p = 31;\n        const int m = 1e9 + 9;\n        long long hash_value = 0;\n        long long p_pow = 1;\n        for (char c : s) {\n            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;\n            p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;\n        }\n        return hash_value;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Precomputing the powers of $p$ might give a performance boost.\n\n    ## Example tasks\n\n    ### Search for duplicate strings in an array of strings\n\n    Problem: Given a list of $n$ strings $s_i$, each no longer than $m$ characters, find all the duplicate strings and divide them into groups.\n\n    From the obvious algorithm involving sorting the strings, we would get a time complexity of $O(n m \\log n)$ where the sorting requires $O(n \\log n)$ comparisons and each comparison take $O(m)$ time.\n    However, by using hashes, we reduce the comparison time to $O(1)$, giving us an algorithm that runs in $O(n m + n \\log n)$ time.\n\n    We calculate the hash for each string, sort the hashes together with the indices, and then group the indices by identical hashes.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=hashing_group_identical_strings}\n    vector<vector<int>> group_identical_strings(vector<string> const& s) {\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<pair<long long, int>> hashes(n);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n            hashes[i] = {compute_hash(s[i]), i};\n\n        sort(hashes.begin(), hashes.end());\n\n        vector<vector<int>> groups;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            if (i == 0 || hashes[i].first != hashes[i-1].first)\n                groups.emplace_back();\n            groups.back().push_back(hashes[i].second);\n        }\n        return groups;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Check whether a graph is bipartite\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Check whether a graph is bipartite\n\n    A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets so that every edge connects two vertices from different sets (i.e. there are no edges which connect vertices from the same set). These sets are usually called sides.\n\n    You are given an undirected graph. Check whether it is bipartite, and if it is, output its sides.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n\n    There exists a theorem which claims that a graph is bipartite if and only if all its cycles have even length. However, in practice it's more convenient to use a different formulation of the definition: a graph is bipartite if and only if it is two-colorable.\n\n    Let's use a series of [breadth-first searches](breadth-first-search.md), starting from each vertex which hasn't been visited yet. In each search, assign the vertex from which we start to side 1. Each time we visit a yet unvisited neighbor of a vertex assigned to one side, we assign it to the other side. When we try to go to a neighbor of a vertex assigned to one side which has already been visited, we check that it has been assigned to the other side; if it has been assigned to the same side, we conclude that the graph is not bipartite. Once we've visited all vertices and successfully assigned them to sides, we know that the graph is bipartite and we have constructed its partitioning.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n    int n;\n    vector<vector<int>> adj;\n\n    vector<int> side(n, -1);\n    bool is_bipartite = true;\n    queue<int> q;\n    for (int st = 0; st < n; ++st) {\n        if (side[st] == -1) {\n            q.push(st);\n            side[st] = 0;\n            while (!q.empty()) {\n                int v = q.front();\n                q.pop();\n                for (int u : adj[v]) {\n                    if (side[u] == -1) {\n                        side[u] = side[v] ^ 1;\n                        q.push(u);\n                    } else {\n                        is_bipartite &= side[u] != side[v];\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    cout << (is_bipartite ? \"YES\" : \"NO\") << endl;\n    ```\n\n    #\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
