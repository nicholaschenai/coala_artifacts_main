INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/74 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if two lists follow the same pattern. The first list contains colors, and the second list contains letters. A pattern is considered the same if the same colors map to the same letters in both lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To determine if the two lists follow the same pattern, we can use a dictionary to map each unique color to its corresponding letter. We will iterate through both lists simultaneously, checking if the current color has been seen before and if it maps to the expected letter. If we find any discrepancies, we return `False`. If we finish checking all elements without issues, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function is_samepatterns(patterns, values):
       create an empty dictionary for mapping
       for each index in the range of the length of patterns:
           get the current color and letter
           if the color is not in the dictionary:
               if the letter is already mapped to another color:
                   return False
               map the color to the letter in the dictionary
           else:
               if the mapped letter does not match the current letter:
                   return False

    Chapter: Data structures
    Section: Comparison to sorting
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Comparison to sorting}

    It is often possible to solve a problem
    using either data structures or sorting.
    Sometimes there are remarkable differences
    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,
    which may be hidden in their time complexities.

    Let us consider a problem where
    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$
    that both contain $n$ elements.
    Our task is to calculate the number of elements
    that belong to both of the lists.
    For example, for the lists
    \[A = [5,2,8,9] \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\]
    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5
    and 9 belong to both of the lists.

    A straightforward solution to the problem is
    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,
    but next we will focus on
    more efficient algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,
    and after this, we iterate through the elements
    of $B$ and check for each elements if it
    also belongs to $A$.
    This is efficient because the elements of $A$
    are in a set.
    Using the \texttt{set} structure,
    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,
    so instead of the \texttt{set} structure
    we can also use the \texttt{unordered\_set} structure.
    This is an easy way to make the algorithm
    more efficient, because we only have to change
    the underlying data structure.
    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.
    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.
    After this, we iterate through both the lists
    at the same time and find the common elements.
    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n)$,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    so the total time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    The following table shows how efficient
    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and
    the elements of the lists are random
    integers between $1 \ldots 10^9$:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\
    $2 \cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\
    $3 \cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\
    $4 \cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\
    $5 \cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that
    they use different set structures.
    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on
    the running time, because Algorithm 2
    is 4–5 times faster than Algorithm 1.

    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3
    which uses sorting.
    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.
    Interestingly, the time complexity of both
    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \log n)$,
    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.
    This can be explained by the fact that
    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done
    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.
    On the other hand,
    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree
    during the whole algorithm.

    Title: String Hashing
    Part: 1/2
    # String Hashing

    Hashing algorithms are helpful in solving a lot of problems.

    We want to solve the problem of comparing strings efficiently.
    The brute force way of doing so is just to compare the letters of both strings, which has a time complexity of $O(\min(n_1, n_2))$ if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sizes of the two strings.
    We want to do better.
    The idea behind the string hashing is the following: we map each string into an integer and compare those instead of the strings.
    Doing this allows us to reduce the execution time of the string comparison to $O(1)$.

    For the conversion, we need a so-called **hash function**.
    The goal of it is to convert a string into an integer, the so-called **hash** of the string.
    The following condition has to hold: if two strings $s$ and $t$ are equal ($s = t$), then also their hashes have to be equal ($\text{hash}(s) = \text{hash}(t)$).
    Otherwise, we will not be able to compare strings.

    Notice, the opposite direction doesn't have to hold.
    If the hashes are equal ($\text{hash}(s) = \text{hash}(t)$), then the strings do not necessarily have to be equal.
    E.g. a valid hash function would be simply $\text{hash}(s) = 0$ for each $s$.
    Now, this is just a stupid example, because this function will be completely useless, but it is a valid hash function.
    The reason why the opposite direction doesn't have to hold, is because there are exponentially many strings.
    If we only want this hash function to distinguish between all strings consisting of lowercase characters of length smaller than 15, then already the hash wouldn't fit into a 64-bit integer (e.g. unsigned long long) any more, because there are so many of them.
    And of course, we don't want to compare arbitrary long integers, because this will also have the complexity $O(n)$.

    So usually we want the hash function to map strings onto numbers of a fixed range $[0, m)$, then comparing strings is just a comparison of two integers with a fixed length.
    And of course, we want $\text{hash}(s) \neq \text{hash}(t)$ to be very likely if $s \neq t$.

    That's the important part that you have to keep in mind.
    Using hashing will not be 100% deterministically correct, because two complete different strings might have the same hash (the hashes collide).
    However, in a wide majority of tasks, this can be safely ignored as the probability of the hashes of two different strings colliding is still very small.
    And we will discuss some techniques in this article how to keep the probability of collisions very low.

    ## Calculation of the hash of a string

    The good and widely used way to define the hash of a string $s$ of length $n$ is

    $$\begin{align}
    \text{hash}(s) &= s[0] + s[1] \cdot p + s[2] \cdot p^2 + ... + s[n-1] \cdot p^{n-1} \mod m \\
    &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \cdot p^i \mod m,
    \end{align}$$

    where $p$ and $m$ are some chosen, positive numbers.
    It is called a **polynomial rolling hash function**.

    It is reasonable to make $p$ a prime number roughly equal to the number of characters in the input alphabet.
    For example, if the input is composed of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, $p = 31$ is a good choice.
    If the input may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, then $p = 53$ is a possible choice.
    The code in this article will use $p = 31$.

    Obviously $m$ should be a large number since the probability of two random strings colliding is about $\approx \frac{1}{m}$.
    Sometimes $m = 2^{64}$ is chosen, since then the integer overflows of 64-bit integers work exactly like the modulo operation.
    However, there exists a method, which generates colliding strings (which work independently from the choice of $p$).
    So in practice, $m = 2^{64}$ is not recommended.
    A good choice for $m$ is some large prime number.
    The code in this article will just use $m = 10^9+9$.
    This is a large number, but still small enough so that we can perform multiplication of two values using 64-bit integers.

    Here is an example of calculating the hash of a string $s$, which contains only lowercase letters.
    We convert each character of $s$ to an integer.
    Here we use the conversion $a \rightarrow 1$, $b \rightarrow 2$, $\dots$, $z \rightarrow 26$.
    Converting $a \rightarrow 0$ is not a good idea, because then the hashes of the strings $a$, $aa$, $aaa$, $\dots$ all evaluate to $0$.

    ```{.cpp file=hashing_function}
    long long compute_hash(string const& s) {
        const int p = 31;
        const int m = 1e9 + 9;
        long long hash_value = 0;
        long long p_pow = 1;
        for (char c : s) {
            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;
            p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;
        }
        return hash_value;
    }
    ```

    Precomputing the powers of $p$ might give a performance boost.

    ## Example tasks

    ### Search for duplicate strings in an array of strings

    Problem: Given a list of $n$ strings $s_i$, each no longer than $m$ characters, find all the duplicate strings and divide them into groups.

    From the obvious algorithm involving sorting the strings, we would get a time complexity of $O(n m \log n)$ where the sorting requires $O(n \log n)$ comparisons and each comparison take $O(m)$ time.
    However, by using hashes, we reduce the comparison time to $O(1)$, giving us an algorithm that runs in $O(n m + n \log n)$ time.

    We calculate the hash for each string, sort the hashes together with the indices, and then group the indices by identical hashes.

    ```{.cpp file=hashing_group_identical_strings}
    vector<vector<int>> group_identical_strings(vector<string> const& s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<pair<long long, int>> hashes(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            hashes[i] = {compute_hash(s[i]), i};

        sort(hashes.begin(), hashes.end());

        vector<vector<int>> groups;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i == 0 || hashes[i].first != hashes[i-1].first)
                groups.emplace_back();
            groups.back().push_back(hashes[i].second);
        }
        return groups;
    }

    Title: Check whether a graph is bipartite
    Part: 1/1
    # Check whether a graph is bipartite

    A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets so that every edge connects two vertices from different sets (i.e. there are no edges which connect vertices from the same set). These sets are usually called sides.

    You are given an undirected graph. Check whether it is bipartite, and if it is, output its sides.

    ## Algorithm

    There exists a theorem which claims that a graph is bipartite if and only if all its cycles have even length. However, in practice it's more convenient to use a different formulation of the definition: a graph is bipartite if and only if it is two-colorable.

    Let's use a series of [breadth-first searches](breadth-first-search.md), starting from each vertex which hasn't been visited yet. In each search, assign the vertex from which we start to side 1. Each time we visit a yet unvisited neighbor of a vertex assigned to one side, we assign it to the other side. When we try to go to a neighbor of a vertex assigned to one side which has already been visited, we check that it has been assigned to the other side; if it has been assigned to the same side, we conclude that the graph is not bipartite. Once we've visited all vertices and successfully assigned them to sides, we know that the graph is bipartite and we have constructed its partitioning.

    ## Implementation

    ```cpp
    int n;
    vector<vector<int>> adj;

    vector<int> side(n, -1);
    bool is_bipartite = true;
    queue<int> q;
    for (int st = 0; st < n; ++st) {
        if (side[st] == -1) {
            q.push(st);
            side[st] = 0;
            while (!q.empty()) {
                int v = q.front();
                q.pop();
                for (int u : adj[v]) {
                    if (side[u] == -1) {
                        side[u] = side[v] ^ 1;
                        q.push(u);
                    } else {
                        is_bipartite &= side[u] != side[v];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    cout << (is_bipartite ? "YES" : "NO") << endl;
    ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/74 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if two lists (one containing colors and the other containing letters) follow the same pattern. This means that if two elements in the first list are the same, their corresponding elements in the second list should also be the same. Conversely, if two elements in the second list are the same, their corresponding elements in the first list should also be the same.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to map each unique element in the first list to its corresponding element in the second list. We will also need to ensure that the mapping is consistent. If we encounter a new element in the first list, we will add it to the dictionary with its corresponding value from the second list. If we encounter an element that has already been mapped, we will check if it maps to the same value as before. We will do the same for the second list to ensure the mapping is bidirectional.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function is_samepatterns(patterns, values):
       create an empty dictionary for patterns_to_values
       create an empty dictionary for values_to_patterns
       
       for i from 0 to length of patterns:

INFO - raw_msg:
 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if two lists (one containing colors and the other containing letters) follow the same pattern. This means that if two elements in the first list are the same, their corresponding elements in the second list should also be the same. Conversely, if two elements in the second list are the same, their corresponding elements in the first list should also be the same.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to map each unique element in the first list to its corresponding element in the second list. We will also need to ensure that the mapping is consistent. If we encounter a new element in the first list, we will add it to the dictionary with its corresponding value from the second list. If we encounter an element that has already been mapped, we will check if it maps to the same value as before. We will do the same for the second list to ensure the mapping is bidirectional.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function is_samepatterns(patterns, values):
       create an empty dictionary for patterns_to_values
       create an empty dictionary for values_to_patterns
       
       for i from 0 to length of patterns:
           if patterns[i] is not in patterns_to_values:
               add patterns[i] to patterns_to_values with value values[i]
           else:
               if patterns_to_values[patterns[i]] is not equal to values[i]:
                   return False
           
           if values[i] is not in values_to_patterns:
               add values[i] to values_to_patterns with value patterns[i]
           else:
               if values_to_patterns[values[i]] is not equal to patterns[i]:
                   return False
       
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_samepatterns(patterns, values):
    # Create dictionaries to map patterns to values and vice versa
    patterns_to_values = {}
    values_to_patterns = {}
    
    # Iterate through each element in the patterns and values
    for i in range(len(patterns)):
        # Check the mapping from patterns to values
        if patterns[i] not in patterns_to_values:
            patterns_to_values[patterns[i]] = values[i]
        else:
            # If already mapped, check for consistency
            if patterns_to_values[patterns[i]] != values[i]:
                return False
        
        # Check the mapping from values to patterns
        if values[i] not in values_to_patterns:
            values_to_patterns[values[i]] = patterns[i]
        else:
            # If already mapped, check for consistency
            if values_to_patterns[values[i]] != patterns[i]:
                return False
    
    # If all checks passed, the patterns match the values
