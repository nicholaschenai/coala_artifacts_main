    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string and an integer `k`, and removes all words from the string that have a length of `k`. The remaining words should be returned as a single string with words separated by spaces.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can split the input string into individual words. Then, we will iterate through these words and check their lengths. If a word's length is equal to `k`, we will skip it; otherwise, we will keep it. Finally, we will join the remaining words back into a single string and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_length(input_string, k):\n       split input_string into words\n       create an empty list for remaining words\n       for each word in words:\n           if length of word is not equal to k:\n               add word to remaining words\n       join remaining words into a single string with spaces\n       return the resulting string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef remove_length(input_string: str, k: int) -> str:\n    # Split the input string into individual words\n    words = input_string.split()\n    \n    # Create a list to hold the words that are not of length k\n    remaining_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the length of the word is not equal to k\n        if len(word) != k:\n            # If not, add the word to the remaining words list\n            remaining_words.append(word)\n    \n    # Join the remaining words into a single string with spaces\n    result = ' '.join(remaining_words)\n    \n    # Return the resulting string\n    return result\n```",
