Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Prefix function. Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm\n    Part: 3/4\n    ```\n\n    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\\pi$, and then compute the final answers:\n    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.\n    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.\n\n    Now let us consider the second problem.\n    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:\n    we create the string $s + \\# + t$ and compute its prefix function.\n    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\\pi[i]$ for $i \\ge n + 1$.\n    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.\n\n    ### The number of different substring in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.\n\n    We will solve this problem iteratively.\n    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.\n\n    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.\n    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.\n    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.\n\n    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.\n    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.\n    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ long.\n    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.\n\n    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \\pi_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.\n\n    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.\n\n    ### Compressing a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to find the shortest \"compressed\" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.\n\n    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.\n    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \\pi[n - 1]$.\n    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.\n\n    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.\n    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.\n    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.\n    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.\n    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.\n    And so on.\n    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.\n\n    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.\n    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.\n    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.\n\n    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.\n    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.\n    We prove it by contradiction.\n    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).\n    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.\n    Now consider the second block of the string.\n    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.\n    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.\n    Contradiction.\n\n    $$\\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \\overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$\n\n    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\\pi[7] = 5}$$\n\n    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \\Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$\n\n    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function\n\n    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \\# + t$.\n    Obviously, since $\\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.\n    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \\#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:\n\n    $$\\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \\dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \\#}_{\\text{need to store}} ~ \\underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \\dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\\text{do not need to store}}$$\n\n    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \\in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.\n\n    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.\n\n    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\\text{old}_\\pi, c) \\rightarrow \\text{new}_\\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                int j = i;\n                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])\n                    j = pi[j-1];\n                if ('a' + c == s[j])\n                    j++;\n                aut[i][c] = j;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.\n    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.\n    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0;

The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how\n    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our\n    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once\n    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent\n    elements.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}\n    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {\n        int k = (int)a.size();\n        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {\n                a[i]++;\n                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)\n                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label=\"Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element\"}\n\n    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such\n    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.\n\n    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):\n    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.\n\n    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:\n    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.\n    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the\n    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove\n    a number, add a number).\n\n    Let us prove this:\n\n    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can \n    be obtained as follows:\n\n    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \\cup 1G(N-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the \n    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and\n    concatenate these two sequences.\n\n    Now we may produce our proof.\n\n    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note\n    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As\n    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.\n    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.\n\n    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.\n\n    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.\n\n    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size\n    $K$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}\n    int gray_code (int n) {\n        return n ^ (n >> 1);\n    }\n\n    int count_bits (int n) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (; n; n >>= 1)\n            res += n & 1;\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {\n            int cur = gray_code (i);\n            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (cur & (1 << j))\n                        cout << j + 1;\n                }\n                cout << \"\\n\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus\n    works in $O\\left(N \\cdot \\binom{N}{K}\\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant\n    than the previous solution.\n\n    The implementation is derived from the formula:\n\n    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \\cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the\n    subsequence from appropriate elements.\n\n    Its implementation is as follows:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}\n    vector<int> ans;\n\n    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {\n        if (k > n || k < 0)\n            return;\n\n        if (!n) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {\n                if (ans[i])\n                    cout << i + 1;\n            }\n            cout << \"\\n\";\n            return;\n        }\n\n        ans[idx] = rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);\n        ans[idx] = !rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {\n        ans.resize(n);\n        gen(n, k, 0, false);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The remaining words should be returned as a single string with words separated by spaces.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can split the input string into individual words. Then, we will iterate through these words and check their lengths. If a word's length is equal to `k`, we will skip it; otherwise, we will keep it. Finally, we will join the remaining words back into a single string and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_length(input_string, k):\n       split input_string into words\n       create an empty list for remaining words\n       for each word in words:\n           if length of word is not equal to k:\n               add word to remaining words\n       join remaining words into a single string with spaces\n       return the resulting string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef remove_length(input_string: str, k: int) -> str:\n    # Split the input string into individual words\n    words = input_string.split()\n    \n    # Create a list to hold the words that are not of length k\n    remaining_words = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each word in the list of words\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the length of the word is not equal to k\n        if len(word) != k:\n            # If not, add the word to the remaining words list\n            remaining_words.append(word)\n    \n    # Join the remaining words into a single string with spaces\n    result = ' '.join(remaining_words)\n    \n    # Return the resulting string\n    return result\n```"
