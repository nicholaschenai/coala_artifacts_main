    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many pairs of strings in a given list are reverse of each other. For example, if one string is \"abc\", we should check if \"cba\" is also in the list. Each unique pair should only be counted once.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a set to keep track of the strings we have seen so far. For each string in the list, we will check if its reverse is also in the set. If it is, we will count that as a valid pair. We will also ensure that we do not count the same pair twice by removing the strings from the set once we have counted them.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_reverse_pairs(string_list):\n       create an empty set called seen\n       create a variable count and set it to 0\n       \n       for each string in string_list:\n           reverse_string = reverse(string)\n           if reverse_string is in seen:\n               increment count by 1\n           add string to seen\n       \n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef reverse_string(s):\n    # Helper function to reverse a string\n    return s[::-1]\n\ndef count_reverse_pairs(string_list):\n    # Create a set to keep track of seen strings\n    seen = set()\n    # Initialize the count of reverse pairs\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each string in the list\n    for string in string_list:\n        # Get the reverse of the current string\n        reversed_string = reverse_string(string)\n        # Check if the reversed string is already seen\n        if reversed_string in seen:\n            # If it is, we found a reverse pair\n            count += 1\n        # Add the current string to the seen set\n        seen.add(string)\n    \n    # Return the total count of reverse pairs found\n    return count\n```",
