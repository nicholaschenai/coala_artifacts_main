    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that determines if a given month number (from 1 to 12) has 31 days. The function should return `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We need to identify which months have 31 days. The months that have 31 days are January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).\n   - We can create a list of these month numbers and check if the input month number is in that list. If it is, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_monthnumb_number(month):\n       define a list of months_with_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]\n       if month is in months_with_31_days:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_monthnumb_number(month):\n    # Define the months that have 31 days\n    months_with_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]\n    \n    # Check if the given month is in the list of months with 31 days\n    if month in months_with_31_days:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```",
