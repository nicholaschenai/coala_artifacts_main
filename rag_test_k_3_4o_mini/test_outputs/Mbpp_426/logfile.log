    Title: Sieve of Eratosthenes
    Part: 1/2
    # Sieve of Eratosthenes

    Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm for finding all the prime numbers in a segment $[1;n]$ using $O(n \log \log n)$ operations.

    The algorithm is very simple:
    at the beginning we write down all numbers between 2 and $n$.
    We mark all proper multiples of 2 (since 2 is the smallest prime number) as composite.
    A proper multiple of a number $x$, is a number greater than $x$ and divisible by $x$.
    Then we find the next number that hasn't been marked as composite, in this case it is 3.
    Which means 3 is prime, and we mark all proper multiples of 3 as composite.
    The next unmarked number is 5, which is the next prime number, and we mark all proper multiples of it.
    And we continue this procedure until we processed all numbers in the row.

    In the following image you can see a visualization of the algorithm for computing all prime numbers in the range $[1; 16]$. It can be seen, that quite often we mark numbers as composite multiple times.

    <center>![Sieve of Eratosthenes](sieve_eratosthenes.png)</center>

    The idea behind is this:
    A number is prime, if none of the smaller prime numbers divides it.
    Since we iterate over the prime numbers in order, we already marked all numbers, who are divisible by at least one of the prime numbers, as divisible.
    Hence if we reach a cell and it is not marked, then it isn't divisible by any smaller prime number and therefore has to be prime.

    ## Implementation

    ```cpp
    int n;
    vector<bool> is_prime(n+1, true);
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        if (is_prime[i] && (long long)i * i <= n) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
                is_prime[j] = false;
        }
    }
    ```

    This code first marks all numbers except zero and one as potential prime numbers, then it begins the process of sifting composite numbers.
    For this it iterates over all numbers from $2$ to $n$.
    If the current number $i$ is a prime number, it marks all numbers that are multiples of $i$ as composite numbers, starting from $i^2$.
    This is already an optimization over naive way of implementing it, and is allowed as all smaller numbers that are multiples of $i$ necessary also have a prime factor which is less than $i$, so all of them were already sifted earlier.
    Since $i^2$ can easily overflow the type `int`, the additional verification is done using type `long long` before the second nested loop.

    Using such implementation the algorithm consumes $O(n)$ of the memory (obviously) and performs $O(n \log \log n)$ (see next section).

    ## Asymptotic analysis

    It's simple to prove a running time of $O(n \log n)$ without knowing anything about the distribution of primes - ignoring the `is_prime` check, the inner loop runs (at most) $n/i$ times for $i = 2, 3, 4, \dots$, leading the total number of operations in the inner loop to be a harmonic sum like $n(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + \cdots)$, which is bounded by $O(n \log n)$.

    Let's prove that algorithm's running time is $O(n \log \log n)$.
    The algorithm will perform $\frac{n}{p}$ operations for every prime $p \le n$ the inner loop.
    Hence, we need to evaluate the next expression:

    $$\sum_{\substack{p \le n, \\\ p \text{ prime}}} \frac n p = n \cdot \sum_{\substack{p \le n, \\\ p \text{ prime}}} \frac 1 p.$$

    Let's recall two known facts.

      - The number of prime numbers less than or equal to $n$ is approximately $\frac n {\ln n}$.
      - The $k$-th prime number approximately equals $k \ln k$ (that follows immediately from the previous fact).

    Thus we can write down the sum in the following way:

    $$\sum_{\substack{p \le n, \\\ p \text{ prime}}} \frac 1 p \approx \frac 1 2 + \sum_{k = 2}^{\frac n {\ln n}} \frac 1 {k \ln k}.$$

    Here we extracted the first prime number 2 from the sum, because $k = 1$ in approximation $k \ln k$  is $0$ and causes a division by zero.

    Now, let's evaluate this sum using the integral of a same function over $k$ from $2$ to $\frac n {\ln n}$ (we can make such approximation because, in fact, the sum is related to the integral as its approximation using the rectangle method):

    $$\sum_{k = 2}^{\frac n {\ln n}} \frac 1 {k \ln k} \approx \int_2^{\frac n {\ln n}} \frac 1 {k \ln k} dk.$$

    The antiderivative for the integrand is  $\ln \ln k$. Using a substitution and removing terms of lower order, we'll get the result:

    $$\int_2^{\frac n {\ln n}} \frac 1 {k \ln k} dk = \ln \ln \frac n {\ln n} - \ln \ln 2 = \ln(\ln n - \ln \ln n) - \ln \ln 2 \approx \ln \ln n.$$

    Now, returning to the original sum, we'll get its approximate evaluation:

    $$\sum_{\substack{p \le n, \\\ p\ is\ prime}} \frac n p \approx n \ln \ln n + o(n).$$

    You can find a more strict proof (that gives more precise evaluation which is accurate within constant multipliers) in the book authored by Hardy & Wright "An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers" (p. 349).

    ## Different optimizations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes

    The biggest weakness of the algorithm is, that it "walks" along the memory multiple times, only manipulating single elements.
    This is not very cache friendly.
    And because of that, the constant which is concealed in $O(n \log \log n)$ is comparably big.

    Besides, the consumed memory is a bottleneck for big $n$.

    The methods presented below allow us to reduce the quantity of the performed operations, as well as to shorten the consumed memory noticeably.

    ### Sieving till root

    Obviously, to find all the prime numbers until $n$, it will be enough just to perform the sifting only by the prime numbers, which do not exceed the root of $n$.

    ```cpp
    int n;
    vector<bool> is_prime(n+1, true);
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = false;
    for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
        if (is_prime[i]) {
            for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i)
                is_prime[j] = false;
        }
    }

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. 

    \subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \subsubsection{Euler's totient function}

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through each number in the input list. For each number, we will check if it is odd (a number is odd if it is not divisible by 2). If it is odd, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing only the odd numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function filter_oddnumbers(input_list):
       create an empty list called odd_numbers
       for each number in input_list:
           if number is odd:
               add number to odd_numbers
       return odd_numbers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_odd(number):
    # Check if the number is odd
    return number % 2 != 0

def filter_oddnumbers(input_list):
    # Create an empty list to store odd numbers
    odd_numbers = []
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in input_list:
        # If the number is odd, add it to the odd_numbers list
        if is_odd(number):
            odd_numbers.append(number)
    # Return the list of odd numbers
    return odd_numbers
```
