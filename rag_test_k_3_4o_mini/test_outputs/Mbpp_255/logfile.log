INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/255 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that takes a list of colors and a number `n`, and generates all possible combinations of the colors where each combination can include the same color multiple times. The function should return these combinations as a list of tuples.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To generate combinations with repetition, we can use a recursive approach. For each color in the list, we can either include it in the current combination or not, and we can repeat this process until we have formed `n` elements in the combination. We will keep track of the current combination and add it to the result once it reaches the desired length.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function combinations_helper(current_combination, start_index, n, result):
       if length of current_combination is equal to n:
           add current_combination as a tuple to result
           return
       for i from start_index to length of colors list:
           add colors[i] to current_combination
           call combinations_helper(current_combination, i, n, result) // allow repetition
           remove last element from current_combination // backtrack

   function combinations_colors(colors, n):
       result = empty list
       call combinations_helper(empty list, 0, n, result)
       return result
   ```

    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations
    Part: 1/1
    # Generating all $K$-combinations

    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.
    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.
    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.

    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label="Generate next lexicographical K-combination"}

    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.
    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how
    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our
    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once
    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent
    elements.

    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}
    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {
        int k = (int)a.size();
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {
                a[i]++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)
                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    ```

    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label="Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element"}

    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such
    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.

    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):
    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.

    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:
    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.
    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the
    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove
    a number, add a number).

    Let us prove this:

    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can 
    be obtained as follows:

    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \cup 1G(N-1)^\text{R}$$

    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the 
    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and
    concatenate these two sequences.

    Now we may produce our proof.

    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note
    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As
    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.
    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.

    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.

    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.

    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size
    $K$.

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}
    int gray_code (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }

    int count_bits (int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (; n; n >>= 1)
            res += n & 1;
        return res;
    }

    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            int cur = gray_code (i);
            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (cur & (1 << j))
                        cout << j + 1;
                }
                cout << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus
    works in $O\left(N \cdot \binom{N}{K}\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant
    than the previous solution.

    The implementation is derived from the formula:

    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\text{R}$$

    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the
    subsequence from appropriate elements.

    Its implementation is as follows:

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}
    vector<int> ans;

    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {
        if (k > n || k < 0)
            return;

        if (!n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {
                if (ans[i])
                    cout << i + 1;
            }
            cout << "\n";
            return;
        }

        ans[idx] = rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);
        ans[idx] = !rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);
    }

    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {
        ans.resize(n);
        gen(n, k, 0, false);
    }
    ```

    Chapter: Complete search
    Section: Generating permutations
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Generating permutations}

    \index{permutation}

    Next we consider the problem of generating
    all permutations of a set of $n$ elements.
    For example, the permutations of $\{0,1,2\}$ are
    $(0,1,2)$, $(0,2,1)$, $(1,0,2)$, $(1,2,0)$,
    $(2,0,1)$ and $(2,1,0)$.
    Again, there are two approaches:
    we can either use recursion or go through the
    permutations iteratively.

    \subsubsection{Method 1}

    Like subsets, permutations can be generated
    using recursion.
    The following function \texttt{search} goes
    through the permutations of the set $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$.
    The function builds a vector \texttt{permutation}
    that contains the permutation,
    and the search begins when the function is
    called without parameters.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    void search() {
        if (permutation.size() == n) {
            // process permutation
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (chosen[i]) continue;
                chosen[i] = true;
                permutation.push_back(i);
                search();
                chosen[i] = false;
                permutation.pop_back();
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Each function call adds a new element to
    \texttt{permutation}.
    The array \texttt{chosen} indicates which
    elements are already included in the permutation.
    If the size of \texttt{permutation} equals the size of the set,
    a permutation has been generated.

    \subsubsection{Method 2}

    \index{next\_permutation@\texttt{next\_permutation}}

    Another method for generating permutations
    is to begin with the permutation
    $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$ and repeatedly
    use a function that constructs the next permutation
    in increasing order.
    The C++ standard library contains the function
    \texttt{next\_permutation} that can be used for this:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    vector<int> permutation;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        permutation.push_back(i);
    }
    do {
        // process permutation
    } while (next_permutation(permutation.begin(),permutation.end()));
    \end{lstlisting}

[Textbook Reference Material]:
    Chapter: Combinatorics
    Section: Binomial coefficients
    Part: 1/2
    \chapter{Combinatorics}

    \index{combinatorics}

    \key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting
    combinations of objects.
    Usually, the goal is to find a way to
    count the combinations efficiently
    without generating each combination separately.

    As an example, consider the problem
    of counting the number of ways to
    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.
    For example, there are 8 representations
    for $4$:
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $1+1+1+1$
    \item $1+1+2$
    \item $1+2+1$
    \item $2+1+1$
    \item $2+2$
    \item $3+1$
    \item $1+3$
    \item $4$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}

    A combinatorial problem can often be solved
    using a recursive function.
    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$
    that gives the number of representations for $n$.
    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.
    The values of the function
    can be recursively calculated as follows:
    \begin{equation*}
        f(n) = \begin{cases}
                   1               & n = 0\\
                   f(0)+f(1)+\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case is $f(0)=1$,
    because the empty sum represents the number 0.
    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to
    choose the first number of the sum.
    If the first number is $k$,
    there are $f(n-k)$ representations
    for the remaining part of the sum.
    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values
    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.

    The first values for the function are:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    f(0) & = & 1 \\
    f(1) & = & 1 \\
    f(2) & = & 2 \\
    f(3) & = & 4 \\
    f(4) & = & 8 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced
    with a closed-form formula.
    In this problem,
    \[
    f(n)=2^{n-1},
    \]
    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$
    possible positions for +-signs in the sum
    and we can choose any subset of them.

    \section{Binomial coefficients}

    \index{binomial coefficient}

    The \key{binomial coefficient} ${n \choose k}$
    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset
    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.
    For example, ${5 \choose 3}=10$,
    because the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$
    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:
    \[ \{1,2,3\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{1,2,5\}, \{1,3,4\}, \{1,3,5\}, 
    \{1,4,5\}, \{2,3,4\}, \{2,3,5\}, \{2,4,5\}, \{3,4,5\} \]

    \subsubsection{Formula 1}

    Binomial coefficients can be
    recursively calculated as follows:

    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}
    \]

    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.
    If $x$ is included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k-1$
    elements from $n-1$ elements,
    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,
    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.

    The base cases for the recursion are
    \[
    {n \choose 0}  =  {n \choose n} = 1,
    \]
    because there is always exactly
    one way to construct an empty subset
    and a subset that contains all the elements.

    \subsubsection{Formula 2}

    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.
    \]

    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.
    We go through all permutations and always
    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation
    in the subset.
    Since the order of the elements in the subset
    and outside the subset does not matter,
    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$

    \subsubsection{Properties}

    For binomial coefficients,
    \[
    {n \choose k}  =  {n \choose n-k},
    \]
    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into
    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements
    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.

    The sum of binomial coefficients is
    \[
    {n \choose 0}+{n \choose 1}+{n \choose 2}+\ldots+{n \choose n}=2^n.
    \]

    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''
    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to
    the $n$th power:

    \[ (a+b)^n =
    {n \choose 0} a^n b^0 + 
    {n \choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +
    \ldots + 
    {n \choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +
    {n \choose n} a^0 b^n. \]

    Binomial coefficients also appear in
    \key{Pascal's triangle}

    above values:

    \subsubsection{Boxes and balls}

    ''Boxes and balls'' is a useful model,
    where we count the ways to
    place $k$ balls in $n$ boxes.
    Let us consider three scenarios:

    \textit{Scenario 1}: Each box can contain
    at most one ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 10 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --
                        (#1+0.5,#2-0.5) -- (#1+0.5,#2+0.5);
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{
        \lax{#1}{#2}{#3}
        \lax{#1+1.2}{#2}{#4}
        \lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}
        \lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}
        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{-4}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    In this scenario, the answer is directly the
    binomial coefficient ${n \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 2}: A box can contain multiple balls.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2$,
    there are 15 solutions:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \newcommand\lax[3]{
    \path[draw,thick,-] (#1-0.5,#2+0.5) -- (#1-0.5,#2-0.5) --
                        (#1+0.5,#2-0.5) -- (#1+0.5,#2+0.5);
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{1}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1-0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    \ifthenelse{\equal{#3}{2}}{\draw[fill=black] (#1+0.2,#2-0.3) circle (0.15);}{}
    }
    \newcommand\laa[7]{
        \lax{#1}{#2}{#3}
        \lax{#1+1.2}{#2}{#4}
        \lax{#1+2.4}{#2}{#5}
        \lax{#1+3.6}{#2}{#6}
        \lax{#1+4.8}{#2}{#7}
    }

    \laa{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-2}{1}{1}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-4}{1}{0}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{0}{-6}{1}{0}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{0}{-8}{1}{0}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-2}{0}{1}{1}{0}{0}
    \laa{8}{-4}{0}{1}{0}{1}{0}
    \laa{8}{-6}{0}{1}{0}{0}{1}
    \laa{8}{-8}{0}{0}{2}{0}{0}
    \laa{16}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}{0}
    \laa{16}{-2}{0}{0}{1}{0}{1}
    \laa{16}{-4}{0}{0}{0}{2}{0}
    \laa{16}{-6}{0}{0}{0}{1}{1}
    \laa{16}{-8}{0}{0}{0}{0}{2}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The process of placing the balls in the boxes
    can be represented as a string
    that consists of symbols
    ''o'' and ''$\rightarrow$''.
    Initially, assume that we are standing at the leftmost box.
    The symbol ''o'' means that we place a ball
    in the current box, and the symbol
    ''$\rightarrow$'' means that we move to
    the next box to the right.

    Using this notation, each solution is a string
    that contains $k$ times the symbol ''o'' and
    $n-1$ times the symbol ''$\rightarrow$''.
    For example, the upper-right solution
    in the above picture corresponds to the string
    ''$\rightarrow$ $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$ o $\rightarrow$''.
    Thus, the number of solutions is
    ${k+n-1 \choose k}$.

    \textit{Scenario 3}: Each box may contain at most one ball,
    and in addition, no two adjacent boxes may both contain a ball.
    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/255 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that generates all possible combinations of a given list of colors, allowing for repetitions, and returns these combinations as a list of tuples. The function should take two inputs: a list of colors and a number `n` that specifies the length of each combination.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To generate combinations with repetition, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to build combinations by selecting each color and recursively adding more colors until we reach the desired length `n`. Each time we select a color, we can either choose the same color again or move to the next color in the list. This will allow us to generate all possible combinations of the specified length.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function combinations_helper(current_combination, colors, n, result):
       if length of current_combination equals n:
           add current_combination as a tuple to result
           return
       for each color in colors:
           add color to current_combination
           call combinations_helper(current_combination, colors, n, result)
           remove last color from current_combination

   function combinations_colors(colors, n):
       result = empty list
       call combinations_helper(empty list, colors, n, result)
       return result
   ```

def combinations_helper(current_combination, colors, n, result):
    # Base case: if the current combination has reached the desired length
