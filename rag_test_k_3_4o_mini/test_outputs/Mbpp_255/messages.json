The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how\n    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our\n    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once\n    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent\n    elements.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}\n    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {\n        int k = (int)a.size();\n        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {\n                a[i]++;\n                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)\n                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label=\"Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element\"}\n\n    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such\n    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.\n\n    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):\n    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.\n\n    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:\n    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.\n    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the\n    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove\n    a number, add a number).\n\n    Let us prove this:\n\n    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can \n    be obtained as follows:\n\n    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \\cup 1G(N-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the \n    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and\n    concatenate these two sequences.\n\n    Now we may produce our proof.\n\n    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note\n    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As\n    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.\n    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.\n\n    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.\n\n    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.\n\n    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size\n    $K$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}\n    int gray_code (int n) {\n        return n ^ (n >> 1);\n    }\n\n    int count_bits (int n) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (; n; n >>= 1)\n            res += n & 1;\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {\n            int cur = gray_code (i);\n            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (cur & (1 << j))\n                        cout << j + 1;\n                }\n                cout << \"\\n\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus\n    works in $O\\left(N \\cdot \\binom{N}{K}\\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant\n    than the previous solution.\n\n    The implementation is derived from the formula:\n\n    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \\cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the\n    subsequence from appropriate elements.\n\n    Its implementation is as follows:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}\n    vector<int> ans;\n\n    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {\n        if (k > n || k < 0)\n            return;\n\n        if (!n) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {\n                if (ans[i])\n                    cout << i + 1;\n            }\n            cout << \"\\n\";\n            return;\n        }\n\n        ans[idx] = rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);\n        ans[idx] = !rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {\n        ans.resize(n);\n        gen(n, k, 0, false);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook

problem of generating\n    all permutations of a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, the permutations of $\\{0,1,2\\}$ are\n    $(0,1,2)$, $(0,2,1)$, $(1,0,2)$, $(1,2,0)$,\n    $(2,0,1)$ and $(2,1,0)$.\n    Again, there are two approaches:\n    we can either use recursion or go through the\n    permutations iteratively.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Method 1}\n\n    Like subsets, permutations can be generated\n    using recursion.\n    The following function \\texttt{search} goes\n    through the permutations of the set $\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\}$.\n    The function builds a vector \\texttt{permutation}\n    that contains the permutation,\n    and the search begins when the function is\n    called without parameters.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void search() {\n        if (permutation.size() == n) {\n            // process permutation\n        } else {\n            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                if (chosen[i]) continue;\n                chosen[i] =

\\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Each function call adds a new element to\n    \\texttt{permutation}.\n    The array \\texttt{chosen} indicates which\n    elements are already included in the permutation.\n    If the size of \\texttt{permutation} equals the size of the set,\n    a permutation has been generated.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Method 2}\n\n    \\index{next\\_permutation@\\texttt{next\\_permutation}}\n\n    Another method for generating permutations\n    is to begin with the permutation\n    $\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\}$ and repeatedly\n    use a function that constructs the next permutation\n    in increasing order.\n    The C++ standard library contains the function\n    \\texttt{next\\_permutation} that can be used for this:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    vector<int> permutation;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        permutation.push_back(i);\n    }\n    do {\n        // process permutation\n    } while (next_permutation(permutation.begin(),permutation.end()));\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Combinatorics\n    Section: Binomial coefficients\n    Part: 1/2\n    \\chapter{Combinatorics}\n\n    \\index{combinatorics}\n\n    \\key{Combinatorics} studies methods for counting\n    combinations of objects.\n    Usually, the goal is to find a way to\n    count the combinations efficiently\n    without generating each combination separately.\n\n    As an example, consider the problem\n    of counting the number of ways to\n    represent an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers.\n    For example, there are 8 representations\n    for $4$:\n    \\begin{multicols}{2}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $1+1+1+1$\n    \\item $1+1+2$\n    \\item $1+2+1$\n    \\item $2+1+1$\n    \\item $2+2$\n    \\item $3+1$\n    \\item $1+3$\n    \\item $4$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{multicols}\n\n    A combinatorial problem can often be solved\n    using a recursive function.\n    In this problem, we can define a function $f(n)$\n    that gives the number of representations for $n$.\n    For example, $f(4)=8$ according to the above example.\n    The values of the function\n    can be recursively calculated as follows:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        f(n) = \\begin{cases}\n                   1               & n = 0\\\\\n                   f(0)+f(1)+\\cdots+f(n-1) & n > 0\\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case is $f(0)=1$,\n    because the empty sum represents the number 0.\n    Then, if $n>0$, we consider all ways to\n    choose the first number of the sum.\n    If the first number is $k$,\n    there are $f(n-k)$ representations\n    for the remaining part of the sum.\n    Thus, we calculate the sum of all values\n    of the form $f(n-k)$ where $k<n$.\n\n    The first values for the function are:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    f(0) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    f(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    f(3) & = & 4 \\\\\n    f(4) & = & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    Sometimes, a recursive formula can be replaced\n    with a closed-form formula.\n    In this problem,\n    \\[\n    f(n)=2^{n-1},\n    \\]\n    which is based on the fact that there are $n-1$\n    possible positions for +-signs in the sum\n    and we can choose any subset of them.\n\n    \\section{Binomial coefficients}\n\n    \\index{binomial coefficient}\n\n    The \\key{binomial coefficient} ${n \\choose k}$\n    equals the number of ways we can choose a subset\n    of $k$ elements from a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, ${5 \\choose 3}=10$,\n    because the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$\n    has 10 subsets of 3 elements:\n    \\[ \\{1,2,3\\}, \\{1,2,4\\}, \\{1,2,5\\}, \\{1,3,4\\}, \\{1,3,5\\}, \n    \\{1,4,5\\}, \\{2,3,4\\}, \\{2,3,5\\}, \\{2,4,5\\}, \\{3,4,5\\} \\]\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 1}\n\n    Binomial coefficients can be\n    recursively calculated as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n-1 \\choose k-1} + {n-1 \\choose k}\n    \\]\n\n    The idea is to fix an element $x$ in the set.\n    If $x$ is included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k-1$\n    elements from $n-1$ elements,\n    and if $x$ is not included in the subset,\n    we have to choose $k$ elements from $n-1$ elements.\n\n    The base cases for the recursion are\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}  =  {n \\choose n} = 1,\n    \\]\n    because there is always exactly\n    one way to construct an empty subset\n    and a subset that contains all the elements.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Formula 2}\n\n    Another way to calculate binomial coefficients is as follows:\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\n    \\]\n\n    There are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements.\n    We go through all permutations and always\n    include the first $k$ elements of the permutation\n    in the subset.\n    Since the order of the elements in the subset\n    and outside the subset does not matter,\n    the result is divided by $k!$ and $(n-k)!$\n\n    \\subsubsection{Properties}\n\n    For binomial coefficients,\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose k}  =  {n \\choose n-k},\n    \\]\n    because we actually divide a set of $n$ elements into\n    two subsets: the first contains $k$ elements\n    and the second contains $n-k$ elements.\n\n    The sum of binomial coefficients is\n    \\[\n    {n \\choose 0}+{n \\choose 1}+{n \\choose 2}+\\ldots+{n \\choose n}=2^n.\n    \\]\n\n    The reason for the name ''binomial coefficient''\n    can be seen when the binomial $(a+b)$ is raised to\n    the $n$th power:\n\n    \\[ (a+b)^n =\n    {n \\choose 0} a^n b^0 + \n    {n \\choose 1} a^{n-1} b^1 +\n    \\ldots + \n    {n \\choose n-1} a^1 b^{n-1} +\n    {n \\choose n} a^0 b^n. \\]\n\n    \\index{Pascal's triangle}\n\n    Binomial coefficients also appear in\n    \\key{Pascal's triangle}\n    where each value equals the sum of two\n    above values:\n

Initially, assume that we are standing at the leftmost box.\n    The symbol ''o'' means that we place a ball\n    in the current box, and the symbol\n    ''$\\rightarrow$'' means that we move to\n    the next box to the right.\n\n    Using this notation, each solution is a string\n    that contains $k$ times the symbol ''o'' and\n    $n-1$ times the symbol ''$\\rightarrow$''.\n    For example, the upper-right solution\n    in the above picture corresponds to the string\n    ''$\\rightarrow$ $\\rightarrow$ o $\\rightarrow$ o $\\rightarrow$''.\n    Thus, the number of solutions is\n    ${k+n-1 \\choose k}$.\n\n    \\textit{Scenario 3}: Each box may contain at most one ball,\n    and in addition, no two adjacent boxes may both contain a ball.\n    For example, when $n=5$ and $k=2\n[/Textbook

The function should take two inputs: a list of colors and a number `n` that specifies the length of each combination.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To generate combinations with repetition, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to build combinations by selecting each color and recursively adding more colors until we reach the desired length `n`. Each time we select a color, we can either choose the same color again or move to the next color in the list. This will allow us to generate all possible combinations of the specified length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function combinations_helper(current_combination, colors, n, result):\n       if length of current_combination equals n:\n           add current_combination as a tuple to result\n           return\n       for each color in colors:\n           add color to current_combination\n           call combinations_helper(current_combination, colors, n, result)\n           remove last color from current_combination\n\n   function combinations_colors(colors, n):\n       result = empty list\n       call combinations_helper(empty list, colors, n, result)\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef combinations_helper(current_combination, colors, n, result):\n    # Base case: if the current combination has reached the desired length\n    if len(current_combination) == n:\n        # Add the current combination as a tuple to the result\n        result.append(tuple(current_combination))\n        return\n    \n    # Iterate through each color in the list\n    for color in colors:\n        # Add the current color to the combination\n        current_combination.append(color)\n        # Recur with the updated combination\n        combinations_helper(current_combination, colors, n, result)\n        # Remove the last color to backtrack\n        current_combination.pop()\n\ndef combinations_colors(colors, n):\n    # Initialize the result list to store combinations\n    result = []\n    # Start the recursive helper function with an empty combination\n    combinations_helper([], colors, n, result)\n    # Return the final list of combinations\n    return result\n```"
