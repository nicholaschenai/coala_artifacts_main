    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a Python function that finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given integer `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of the Solution**: To find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`, we can use a loop to keep multiplying 2 until we exceed `n`. The last valid power of 2 before exceeding `n` will be our answer.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function highest_Power_of_2(n):\n       power = 1  # Start with 2^0\n       while power * 2 <= n:  # Check if the next power of 2 is still <= n\n           power *= 2  # Move to the next power of 2\n       return power  # Return the highest power of 2 found\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef highest_Power_of_2(n):\n    power = 1  # Start with 2^0\n    while power * 2 <= n:  # Check if the next power of 2 is still <= n\n        power *= 2  # Move to the next power of 2\n    return power  # Return the highest power of 2 found\n```",
