INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string of brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) is balanced. A string is considered balanced if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the expression is balanced, we can use a stack data structure. We will iterate through each character in the string:
   - If we encounter an opening bracket (i.e., '(', '{', or '['), we will push it onto the stack.
   - If we encounter a closing bracket (i.e., ')', '}', or ']'), we will check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, we pop the top of the stack. If not, the expression is unbalanced.
   - At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, the expression is balanced; otherwise, it is unbalanced.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_expression(expression):
       create an empty stack
       for each character in expression:
           if character is '(', '{', or '[':
               push character onto the stack
           else if character is ')', '}', or ']':
               if stack is empty:
                   return False
               top = pop from stack
               if character does not match top:
                   return False
       return True if stack is empty, else return False
   ```

```python
def check_expression(expression: str) -> bool:
    # Create an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    # Define a mapping of closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets

    Part: 1/2
    # Balanced bracket sequences

    A **balanced bracket sequence** is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence, when inserted certain numbers and mathematical operations, gives a valid mathematical expression.
    Formally you can define balanced bracket sequence with:

    - $e$ (the empty string) is a balanced bracket sequence.
    - if $s$ is a balanced bracket sequence, then so is $(s)$.
    - if $s$ and $t$ are balanced bracket sequences, then so is $s t$.

    For instance $(())()$ is a balanced bracket sequence, but $())($ is not.

    Of course you can define other bracket sequences also with multiple bracket types in a similar fashion.

    In this article we discuss some classic problems involving balanced bracket sequences (for simplicity we will only call them sequences): validation, number of sequences, finding the lexicographical next sequence, generating all sequences of a certain size, finding the index of sequence, and generating the $k$-th sequences.
    We will also discuss two variations for the problems, the simpler version when only one type of brackets is allowed, and the harder case when there are multiple types.

    ## Balance validation

    We want to check if a given string is balanced or not.

    At first suppose there is only one type of bracket.
    For this case there exists a very simple algorithm.
    Let $\text{depth}$ be the current number of open brackets.
    Initially $\text{depth} = 0$.
    We iterate over all character of the string, if the current bracket character is an opening bracket, then we increment $\text{depth}$, otherwise we decrement it.
    If at any time the variable $\text{depth}$ gets negative, or at the end it is different from $0$, then the string is not a balanced sequence.
    Otherwise it is.

    If there are several bracket types involved, then the algorithm needs to be changes.
    Instead of a counter $\text{depth}$ we create a stack, in which we will store all opening brackets that we meet.
    If the current bracket character is an opening one, we put it onto the stack.
    If it is a closing one, then we check if the stack is non-empty, and if the top element of the stack is of the same type as the current closing bracket.
    If both conditions are fulfilled, then we remove the opening bracket from the stack.
    If at any time one of the conditions is not fulfilled, or at the end the stack is not empty, then the string is not balanced.
    Otherwise it is.

    ## Number of balanced sequences

    ### Formula

    The number of balanced bracket sequences with only one bracket type can be calculated using the [Catalan numbers](catalan-numbers.md).
    The number of balanced bracket sequences of length $2n$ ($n$ pairs of brackets) is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$$

    If we allow $k$ types of brackets, then each pair be of any of the $k$ types (independently of the others), thus the number of balanced bracket sequences is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} k^n$$

    ### Dynamic programming

    On the other hand these numbers can be computed using **dynamic programming**.
    Let $d[n]$ be the number of regular bracket sequences with $n$ pairs of bracket.
    Note that in the first position there is always an opening bracket.
    And somewhere later is the corresponding closing bracket of the pair.
    It is clear that inside this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence, and similarly after this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence.
    So to compute $d[n]$, we will look at how many balanced sequences of $i$ pairs of brackets are inside this first bracket pair, and how many balanced sequences with $n-1-i$ pairs are after this pair.
    Consequently the formula has the form:

    $$d[n] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d[i] \cdot d[n-1-i]$$

    The initial value for this recurrence is $d[0] = 1$.

    ## Finding the lexicographical next balanced sequence

    Here we only consider the case with one valid bracket type.

    Given a balanced sequence, we have to find the next (in lexicographical order) balanced sequence.

    It should be obvious, that we have to find the rightmost opening bracket, which we can replace by a closing bracket without violation the condition, that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets up to this position.
    After replacing this position, we can fill the remaining part of the string with the lexicographically minimal one: i.e. first with as much opening brackets as possible, and then fill up the remaining positions with closing brackets.
    In other words we try to leave a long as possible prefix unchanged, and the suffix gets replaced by the lexicographically minimal one.

    To find this position, we can iterate over the character from right to left, and maintain the balance $\text{depth}$ of open and closing brackets.
    When we meet an opening brackets, we will decrement $\text{depth}$, and when we meet a closing bracket, we increase it.
    If we are at some point meet an opening bracket, and the balance after processing this symbol is positive, then we have found the rightmost position that we can change.
    We change the symbol, compute the number of opening and closing brackets that we have to add to the right side, and arrange them in the lexicographically minimal way.

    If we find do suitable position, then this sequence is already the maximal possible one, and there is no answer.

    ```{.cpp file=next_balanced_brackets_sequence}
    bool next_balanced_sequence(string & s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '(')
                depth--;
            else
                depth++;

            if (s[i] == '(' && depth > 0) {
                depth--;
                int open = (n - i - 1 - depth) / 2;
                int close = n - i - 1 - open;
                string next = s.substr(0, i) + ')' + string(open, '(') + string(close, ')');
                s.swap(next);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    Title: Balanced bracket sequences
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    This function computes in $O(n)$ time the next balanced bracket sequence, and returns false if there is no next one.

    ## Finding all balanced sequences

    Sometimes it is required to find and output all balanced bracket sequences of a specific length $n$.

    To generate then, we can start with the lexicographically smallest sequence $((\dots(())\dots))$, and then continue to find the next lexicographically sequences with the algorithm described in the previous section.

    However, if the length of the sequence is not very long (e.g. $n$ smaller than $12$), then we can also generate all permutations conveniently with the C++ STL function `next_permutation`, and check each one for balanceness.

    Also they can be generate using the ideas we used for counting all sequences with dynamic programming.
    We will discuss the ideas in the next two sections.

    ## Sequence index

    Given a balanced bracket sequence with $n$ pairs of brackets.
    We have to find its index in the lexicographically ordered list of all balanced sequences with $n$ bracket pairs.

    Let's define an auxiliary array $d[i][j]$, where $i$ is the length of the bracket sequence (semi-balanced, each closing bracket has a corresponding opening bracket, but not every opening bracket has necessarily a corresponding closing one), and $j$ is the current balance (difference between opening and closing brackets).
    $d[i][j]$ is the number of such sequences that fit the parameters.
    We will calculate these numbers with only one bracket type.

    For the start value $i = 0$ the answer is obvious: $d[0][0] = 1$, and $d[0][j] = 0$ for $j > 0$.
    Now let $i > 0$, and we look at the last character in the sequence.
    If the last character was an opening bracket $($, then the state before was $(i-1, j-1)$, if it was a closing bracket $)$, then the previous state was $(i-1, j+1)$.
    Thus we obtain the recursion formula:

    $$d[i][j] = d[i-1][j-1] + d[i-1][j+1]$$

    $d[i][j] = 0$ holds obviously for negative $j$.
    Thus we can compute this array in $O(n^2)$.

    Now let us generate the index for a given sequence.

    First let there be only one type of brackets.
    We will us the counter $\text{depth}$ which tells us how nested we currently are, and iterate over the characters of the sequence.
    If the current character $s[i]$ is equal to $($, then we increment $\text{depth}$.
    If the current character $s[i]$ is equal to $)$, then we must add $d[2n-i-1][\text{depth}+1]$ to the answer, taking all possible endings starting with a $($ into account (which are lexicographically smaller sequences), and then decrement $\text{depth}$.

    New let there be $k$ different bracket types.

    Thus, when we look at the current character $s[i]$ before recomputing $\text{depth}$, we have to go through all bracket types that are smaller than the current character, and try to put this bracket into the current position (obtaining a new balance $\text{ndepth} = \text{depth} \pm 1$), and add the number of ways to finish the sequence (length $2n-i-1$, balance $ndepth$) to the answer:

    $$d[2n - i - 1][\text{ndepth}] \cdot k^{\frac{2n - i - 1 - ndepth}{2}}$$

    This formula can be derived as follows:
    First we "forget" that there are multiple bracket types, and just take the answer $d[2n - i - 1][\text{ndepth}]$.
    Now we consider how the answer will change is we have $k$ types of brackets.
    We have $2n - i - 1$ undefined positions, of which $\text{ndepth}$ are already predetermined because of the opening brackets.
    But all the other brackets ($(2n - i - 1 - \text{ndepth})/2$ pairs) can be of any type, therefore we multiply the number by such a power of $k$.

    ## Finding the $k$-th sequence {data-toc-label="Finding the k-th sequence"}

    Let $n$ be the number of bracket pairs in the sequence.
    We have to find the $k$-th balanced sequence in lexicographically sorted list of all balanced sequences for a given $k$.

    As in the previous section we compute the auxiliary array $d[i][j]$, the number of semi-balanced bracket sequences of length $i$ with balance $j$.

    First, we start with only one bracket type.

    We will iterate over the characters in the string we want to generate.
    As in the previous problem we store a counter $\text{depth}$, the current nesting depth.
    In each position we have to decide if we use an opening of a closing bracket.
    To have to put an opening bracket character, it $d[2n - i - 1][\text{depth}+1] \ge k$.
    We increment the counter $\text{depth}$, and move on to the next character.
    Otherwise we decrement $k$ by $d[2n - i - 1][\text{depth}+1]$, put a closing bracket and move on.

    ```{.cpp file=kth_balances_bracket}
    string kth_balanced(int n, int k) {
        vector<vector<int>> d(2*n+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));
        d[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 2*n; i++) {
            d[i][0] = d[i-1][1];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
                d[i][j] = d[i-1][j-1] + d[i-1][j+1];
            d[i][n] = d[i-1][n-1];
        }

        string ans;
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2*n; i++) {
            if (depth + 1 <= n && d[2*n-i-1][depth+1] >= k) {
                ans += '(';
                depth++;
            } else {
                ans += ')';
                if (depth + 1 <= n)
                    k -= d[2*n-i-1][depth+1];
                depth--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    Now let there be $k$ types of brackets.
    The solution will only differ slightly in that we have to multiply the value $d[2n-i-1][\text{ndepth}]$ by $k^{(2n-i-1-\text{ndepth})/2}$ and take into account that there can be different bracket types for the next character.

    Here is an implementation using two types of brackets: round and square:

    ```{.cpp file=kth_balances_bracket_multiple}
    string kth_balanced2(int n, int k) {
        vector<vector<int>> d(2*n+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));
        d[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 2*n; i++) {
            d[i][0] = d[i-1][1];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
                d[i][j] = d[i-1][j-1] + d[i-1][j+1];
            d[i][n] = d[i-1][n-1];
        }

        string ans;
        int shift, depth = 0;

        stack<char> st;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2*n; i++) {

            // '('
            shift = ((2*n-i-1-depth-1) / 2);
            if (shift >= 0 && depth + 1 <= n) {
                int cnt = d[2*n-i-1][depth+1] << shift;
                if (cnt >= k) {
                    ans += '(';
                    st.push('(');
                    depth++;
                    continue;
                }
                k -= cnt;
            }

            // ')'
            shift = ((2*n-i-1-depth+1) / 2);

    Part: 1/2
    # Expression parsing

    A string containing a mathematical expression containing numbers and various operators is given.
    We have to compute the value of it in $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the string.

    The algorithm discussed here translates an expression into the so-called **reverse Polish notation** (explicitly or implicitly), and evaluates this expression.

    ## Reverse Polish notation

    The reverse Polish notation is a form of writing mathematical expressions, in which the operators are located after their operands.
    For example the following expression

    $$a + b * c * d + (e - f) * (g * h + i)$$

    can be written in reverse Polish notation in the following way:

    $$a b c * d * + e f - g h * i + * +$$

    The reverse Polish notation was developed by the Australian philosopher and computer science specialist Charles Hamblin in the mid 1950s on the basis of the Polish notation, which was proposed in 1920 by the Polish mathematician Jan Łukasiewicz.

    The convenience of the reverse Polish notation is, that expressions in this form are very **easy to evaluate** in linear time.
    We use a stack, which is initially empty.
    We will iterate over the operands and operators of the expression in reverse Polish notation.
    If the current element is a number, then we put the value on top of the stack, if the current element is an operator, then we get the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and put the result back on top of the stack.
    In the end there will be exactly one element left in the stack, which will be the value of the expression.

    Obviously this simple evaluation runs in $O(n)$ time.

    ## Parsing of simple expressions

    For the time being we only consider a simplified problem:
    we assume that all operators are **binary** (i.e. they take two arguments), and all are **left-associative** (if the priorities are equal, they get executed from left to right).
    Parentheses are allowed.

    We will set up two stacks: one for numbers, and one for operators and parentheses.
    Initially both stacks are empty.
    For the second stack we will maintain the condition that all operations are ordered by strict descending priority.
    If there are parenthesis on the stack, than each block of operators (corresponding to one pair of parenthesis) is ordered, and the entire stack is not necessarily ordered.

    We will iterate over the characters of the expression from left to right.
    If the current character is a digit, then we put the value of this number on the stack.
    If the current character is an opening parenthesis, then we put it on the stack.
    If the current character is a closing parenthesis, the we execute all operators on the stack until we reach the opening bracket (in other words we perform all operations inside the parenthesis).
    Finally if the current character is an operator, then while the top of the stack has an operator with the same or higher priority, we will execute this operation, and put the new operation on the stack.

    After we processed the entire string, some operators might still be in the stack, so we execute them.

    Here is the implementation of this method for the four operators $+$ $-$ $*$ $/$:

    ```{.cpp file=expression_parsing_simple}
    bool delim(char c) {
        return c == ' ';
    }

    bool is_op(char c) {
        return c == '+' || c == '-' || c == '*' || c == '/';
    }

    int priority (char op) {
        if (op == '+' || op == '-')
            return 1;
        if (op == '*' || op == '/')
            return 2;
        return -1;
    }

    void process_op(stack<int>& st, char op) {
        int r = st.top(); st.pop();
        int l = st.top(); st.pop();
        switch (op) {
            case '+': st.push(l + r); break;
            case '-': st.push(l - r); break;
            case '*': st.push(l * r); break;
            case '/': st.push(l / r); break;
        }
    }

    int evaluate(string& s) {
        stack<int> st;
        stack<char> op;
        for (int i = 0; i < (int)s.size(); i++) {
            if (delim(s[i]))
                continue;
        
            if (s[i] == '(') {
                op.push('(');
            } else if (s[i] == ')') {
                while (op.top() != '(') {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.pop();
            } else if (is_op(s[i])) {
                char cur_op = s[i];
                while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) {
                    process_op(st, op.top());
                    op.pop();
                }
                op.push(cur_op);
            } else {
                int number = 0;
                while (i < (int)s.size() && isalnum(s[i]))
                    number = number * 10 + s[i++] - '0';
                --i;
                st.push(number);
            }
        }

        while (!op.empty()) {
            process_op(st, op.top());
            op.pop();
        }
        return st.top();
    }
    ```

    Thus we learned how to calculate the value of an expression in $O(n)$, at the same time we implicitly used the reverse Polish notation.
    By slightly modifying the above implementation it is also possible to obtain the expression in reverse Polish notation in an explicit form.

    ## Unary operators

    Now suppose that the expression also contains **unary** operators (operators that take one argument).
    The unary plus and unary minus are common examples of such operators.

    One of the differences in this case, is that we need to determine whether the current operator is a unary or a binary one.

    You can notice, that before an unary operator, there always is another operator or an opening parenthesis, or nothing at all (if it is at the very beginning of the expression).
    On the contrary before a binary operator there will always be an operand (number) or a closing parenthesis.
    Thus it is easy to flag whether the next operator can be unary or not. 

    Additionally we need to execute a unary and a binary operator differently.
    And we need to chose the priority of a unary operator higher than all of the binary operators.

    In addition it should be noted, that some unary operators (e.g. unary plus and unary minus) are actually **right-associative**.

    ## Right-associativity

    Right-associative means, that whenever the priorities are equal, the operators must be evaluated from right to left.

    As noted above, unary operators are usually right-associative.
    Another example for an right-associative operator is the exponentiation operator ($a \wedge b \wedge c$ is usually perceived as $a^{b^c}$ and not as $(a^b)^c$).

    What difference do we need to make in order to correctly handle right-associative operators?
    It turns out that the changes are very minimal.
    The only difference will be, if the priorities are equal we will postpone the execution of the right-associative operation.

    The only line that needs to be replaced is
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op))
    ```
    with
    ```cpp
    while (!op.empty() && (
            (left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) >= priority(cur_op)) ||
            (!left_assoc(cur_op) && priority(op.top()) > priority(cur_op))
        ))

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/771 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   The task is to create a function that checks if a given string of brackets (which can include different types of brackets like `{}`, `()`, and `[]`) is balanced. A balanced string means that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: 
   To determine if the string is balanced, we can use a stack data structure. As we iterate through the string:
   - If we encounter an opening bracket (`{`, `(`, or `[`), we push it onto the stack.
   - If we encounter a closing bracket (`}`, `)`, or `]`), we check if the stack is not empty and if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If both conditions are met, we pop the stack. If not, the string is unbalanced.
   - At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, the string is balanced; otherwise, it is not.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function check_expression(expression):
       create an empty stack
       for each character in expression:
           if character is an opening bracket:
               push character onto the stack
           else if character is a closing bracket:
               if stack is empty:
                   return False
               top = pop from stack
               if top does not match the corresponding opening bracket for character:
                   return False
       return True if stack is empty, else False
   ```
