    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4, and their squares are 4 and 16, respectively. The sum of these squares is 20.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. The `i-th` even natural number can be calculated as `2 * i`.\n   - For each of these even numbers, calculate its square.\n   - Sum all the squared values to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function square_Sum(n):\n       sum = 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           even_number = 2 * i\n           sum += even_number * even_number\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the sum of squares of the first n even natural numbers\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    sum = 0\n    # Loop through the first n natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th even natural number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Add the square of the even number to the sum\n        sum += even_number * even_number\n    # Return the final sum\n    return sum\n```",
