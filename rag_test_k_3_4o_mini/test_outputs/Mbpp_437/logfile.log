INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/437 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string that contains only the characters from the original string that are located at even indices. In other words, we want to remove characters that are at odd positions in the string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and check the index of each character. If the index is even, we will keep that character; if it is odd, we will skip it. We can then combine all the kept characters into a new string and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function remove_odd(input_string):
       create an empty string result
       for index from 0 to length of input_string - 1:
           if index is even:

    Title: Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    Terminal characters `$` and `^` were used to avoid dealing with ends of the string separately.

    ## Manacher's algorithm

    We describe the algorithm to find all the sub-palindromes with odd length, i. e. to calculate $d_{odd}[]$.

    For fast calculation we'll maintain the **borders $(l, r)$** of the rightmost found (sub-)palindrome (i. e. the current rightmost (sub-)palindrome is $s[l+1] s[l+2] \dots s[r-1]$). Initially we set $l = 0, r = 1$, which corresponds to the empty string.

    So, we want to calculate $d_{odd}[i]$ for the next $i$, and all the previous values in $d_{odd}[]$ have been already calculated. We do the following:

    * If $i$ is outside the current sub-palindrome, i. e. $i \geq r$, we'll just launch the trivial algorithm.
    
        So we'll increase $d_{odd}[i]$ consecutively and check each time if the current rightmost substring $[i - d_{odd}[i]\dots i + d_{odd}[i]]$ is a palindrome. When we find the first mismatch or meet the boundaries of $s$, we'll stop. In this case we've finally calculated $d_{odd}[i]$. After this, we must not forget to update $(l, r)$. $r$ should be updated in such a way that it represents the last index of the current rightmost sub-palindrome.

    * Now consider the case when $i \le r$. We'll try to extract some information from the already calculated values in $d_{odd}[]$. So, let's find the "mirror" position of $i$ in the sub-palindrome $(l, r)$, i.e. we'll get the position $j = l + (r - i)$, and we check the value of $d_{odd}[j]$. Because $j$ is the position symmetrical to $i$ with respect to $(l+r)/2$, we can **almost always** assign $d_{odd}[i] = d_{odd}[j]$. Illustration of this (palindrome around $j$ is actually "copied" into the palindrome around $i$):
    
        $$
        \ldots\ 
        \overbrace{
            s_{l+1}\ \ldots\ 
            \underbrace{
                s_{j-d_{odd}[j]+1}\ \ldots\ s_j\ \ldots\ s_{j+d_{odd}[j]-1}\ 
            }_\text{palindrome}\ 
            \ldots\ 
            \underbrace{
                s_{i-d_{odd}[j]+1}\ \ldots\ s_i\ \ldots\ s_{i+d_{odd}[j]-1}\ 
            }_\text{palindrome}\ 
            \ldots\ s_{r-1}\ 
        }^\text{palindrome}\ 
        \ldots
        $$
    
        But there is a **tricky case** to be handled correctly: when the "inner" palindrome reaches the borders of the "outer" one, i. e. $j - d_{odd}[j] \le l$ (or, which is the same, $i + d_{odd}[j] \ge r$). Because the symmetry outside the "outer" palindrome is not guaranteed, just assigning $d_{odd}[i] = d_{odd}[j]$ will be incorrect: we do not have enough data to state that the palindrome in the position $i$ has the same length.
    
        Actually, we should restrict the length of our palindrome for now, i. e. assign $d_{odd}[i] = r - i$, to handle such situations correctly. After this we'll run the trivial algorithm which will try to increase $d_{odd}[i]$ while it's possible.
    
        Illustration of this case (the palindrome with center $j$ is restricted to fit the "outer" palindrome):
    
        $$
        \ldots\ 
        \overbrace{
            \underbrace{
                s_{l+1}\ \ldots\ s_j\ \ldots\ s_{j+(j-l)-1}\ 
            }_\text{palindrome}\ 
            \ldots\ 
            \underbrace{
                s_{i-(r-i)+1}\ \ldots\ s_i\ \ldots\ s_{r-1}
            }_\text{palindrome}\ 
        }^\text{palindrome}\ 
        \underbrace{
            \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots
        }_\text{try moving here}
        $$
    
        It is shown in the illustration that though the palindrome with center $j$ could be larger and go outside the "outer" palindrome, but with $i$ as the center we can use only the part that entirely fits into the "outer" palindrome. But the answer for the position $i$ ($d_{odd}[i]$) can be much bigger than this part, so next we'll run our trivial algorithm that will try to grow it outside our "outer" palindrome, i. e. to the region "try moving here".

    Again, we should not forget to update the values $(l, r)$ after calculating each $d_{odd}[i]$.

    ## Complexity of Manacher's algorithm

    At the first glance it's not obvious that this algorithm has linear time complexity, because we often run the naive algorithm while searching the answer for a particular position.

    However, a more careful analysis shows that the algorithm is linear. In fact, [Z-function building algorithm](/string/z-function.html), which looks similar to this algorithm, also works in linear time.

    We can notice that every iteration of trivial algorithm increases $r$ by one. Also $r$ cannot be decreased during the algorithm. So, trivial algorithm will make $O(n)$ iterations in total.

    Other parts of Manacher's algorithm work obviously in linear time. Thus, we get $O(n)$ time complexity.

    ## Implementation of Manacher's algorithm

    For calculating $d_{odd}[]$, we get the following code. Things to note:

     - $i$ is the index of the center letter of the current palindrome.
     - If $i$ exceeds $r$, $d_{odd}[i]$ is initialized to 0.
     - If $i$ does not exceed $r$, $d_{odd}[i]$ is either initialized to the $d_{odd}[j]$, where $j$ is the mirror position of $i$ in $(l,r)$, or $d_{odd}[i]$ is restricted to the size of the "outer" palindrome.
     - The while loop denotes the trivial algorithm. We launch it irrespective of the value of $k$.
     - If the size of palindrome centered at $i$ is $x$, then $d_{odd}[i]$ stores $\frac{x+1}{2}$.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        s = "$" + s + "^";
        vector<int> p(n + 2);
        int l = 1, r = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            p[i] = max(0, min(r - i, p[l + (r - i)]));
            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {
                p[i]++;
            }
            if(i + p[i] > r) {
                l = i - p[i], r = i + p[i];
            }
        }
        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);
    }
    ```

    ## Working with parities

    Although it is possible to implement Manacher's algorithm for odd and even lengths separately, the implementation of the version for even lengths is often deemed more difficult, as it is less natural and easily leads to off-by-one errors.

    To mitigate this, it is possible to reduce the whole problem to the case when we only deal with the palindromes of odd length. To do this, we can put an additional `#` character between each letter in the string and also in the beginning and the end of the string:

    $$abcbcba \to \#a\#b\#c\#b\#c\#b\#a\#,$$

    $$d = [1,2,1,2,1,4,1,8,1,4,1,2,1,2,1].$$

    As you can see, $d[2i]=2 d_{even}[i]+1$ and $d[2i+1]=2 d_{odd}[i]$ where $d$ denotes the Manacher array for odd-length palindromes in `#`-joined string, while $d_{odd}$ and $d_{even}$ correspond to the arrays defined above in the initial string.

    Indeed, `#` characters do not affect the odd-length palindromes, which are still centered in the initial string's characters, but now even-length palindromes of the initial string are odd-length palindromes of the new string centered in `#` characters.

    Note that $d[2i]$ and $d[2i+1]$ are essentially the increased by $1$ lengths of the largest odd- and even-length palindromes centered in $i$ correspondingly.

    The reduction is implemented in the following way:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> manacher(string s) {
        string t;
        for(auto c: s) {
            t += string("#") + c;
        }
        auto res = manacher_odd(t + "#");
        return vector<int>(begin(res) + 1, end(res) - 1);
    }
    ```

    For simplicity, splitting the array into $d_{odd}$ and $d_{even}$ as well as their explicit calculation is omitted.

    Title: Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$
    Part: 1/2
    # Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$

    ## Statement

    Given string $s$ with length $n$. Find all the pairs $(i, j)$ such that substring $s[i\dots j]$ is a palindrome. String $t$ is a palindrome when $t = t_{rev}$ ($t_{rev}$ is a reversed string for $t$).

    ## More precise statement

    In the worst case string might have up to $O(n^2)$ palindromic substrings, and at the first glance it seems that there is no linear algorithm for this problem.

    But the information about the palindromes can be kept **in a compact way**: for each position $i$ we will find the number of non-empty palindromes centered at this position.

    Palindromes with a common center form a contiguous chain, that is if we have a palindrome of length $l$ centered in $i$, we also have palindromes of lengths $l-2$, $l-4$ and so on also centered in $i$. Therefore, we will collect the information about all palindromic substrings in this way.

    Palindromes of odd and even lengths are accounted for separately as $d_{odd}[i]$ and $d_{even}[i]$. For the palindromes of even length we assume that they're centered in the position $i$ if their two central characters are $s[i]$ and $s[i-1]$.

    For instance, string $s = abababc$ has three palindromes with odd length with centers in the position $s[3] = b$, i. e. $d_{odd}[3] = 3$:

    $$a\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{b}_{s_3}\ a\ b}^{d_{odd}[3]=3} c$$

    And string $s = cbaabd$ has two palindromes with even length with centers in the position $s[3] = a$, i. e. $d_{even}[3] = 2$:

    $$c\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{a}_{s_3}\ b}^{d_{even}[3]=2} d$$

    It's a surprising fact that there is an algorithm, which is simple enough, that calculates these "palindromity arrays" $d_{odd}[]$ and $d_{even}[]$ in linear time. The algorithm is described in this article.

    ## Solution

    In general, this problem has many solutions: with [String Hashing](/string/string-hashing.html) it can be solved in $O(n\cdot \log n)$, and with [Suffix Trees](/string/suffix-tree-ukkonen.html) and fast LCA this problem can be solved in $O(n)$.

    But the method described here is **sufficiently** simpler and has less hidden constant in time and memory complexity. This algorithm was discovered by **Glenn K. Manacher** in 1975.

    Another modern way to solve this problem and to deal with palindromes in general is through the so-called palindromic tree, or eertree.

    ## Trivial algorithm

    To avoid ambiguities in the further description we denote what "trivial algorithm" is.

    It's the algorithm that does the following. For each center position $i$ it tries to increase the answer by one as long as it's possible, comparing a pair of corresponding characters each time.

    Such an algorithm is slow, it can calculate the answer only in $O(n^2)$.

    The implementation of the trivial algorithm is:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        s = "$" + s + "^";
        vector<int> p(n + 2);
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {
                p[i]++;
            }
        }
        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);
    }

    It's also possible to do the check with only 7 bases: 2, 325, 9375, 28178, 450775, 9780504 and 1795265022.
    However, since these numbers (except 2) are not prime, you need to check additionally if the number you are checking is equal to any prime divisor of those bases: 2, 3, 5, 13, 19, 73, 193, 407521, 299210837.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/437 [prompt] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and removes all characters that are located at odd indices (1-based) from that string. The output should be a new string containing only the characters that were at even indices.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and collect characters that are at even indices. Since Python uses 0-based indexing, we will collect characters at indices 0, 2, 4, etc. We can achieve this by using a loop or a list comprehension to filter out the characters based on their indices.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function remove_odd(s: str) -> str:
       initialize an empty list result
       for index from 0 to length of s - 1:
           if index is even:
               append s[index] to result
       return the joined string of result
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def remove_odd(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty list to store characters at even indices
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through the string using index
    for index in range(len(s)):
        # Check if the index is even
        if index % 2 == 0:
            # Append the character at the even index to the result list
            result.append(s[index])
    
    # Join the list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(result)

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/437 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify where the code went wrong.

1. **Understanding the Requirement**: The function is supposed to remove characters at odd indices from the string. In the context of the string "python":
   - The characters at odd indices (1-based) are:
     - Index 1: 'y'
     - Index 3: 'h'
     - Index 5: 'n'
   - Therefore, the characters that should remain (those at even indices) are 'p', 't', and 'o', which is not the expected output.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: The mistake in the previous implementation is in the interpretation of the indices. The function was designed to keep characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.), but the requirement is to keep characters at odd indices (1-based), which translates to keeping characters at indices 1, 3, 5, etc. in 0-based indexing.

3. **Correcting the Logic**: To fix the function, I need to change the condition to check for odd indices instead of even indices. Specifically, I should collect characters at indices 1, 3, 5, etc. in the string.

Now, I will implement the corrected logic in the function. 

Here’s the updated solution:

```python
def remove_odd(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty list to store characters at odd indices (1-based)
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through the string using index
    for index in range(len(s)):
        # Check if the index is odd (0-based, so we check if index % 2 != 0)
        if index % 2 != 0:
            # Append the character at the odd index to the result list
            result.append(s[index])
    
    # Join the list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(result)

    Title: Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    Terminal characters `$` and `^` were used to avoid dealing with ends of the string separately.

    ## Manacher's algorithm

    We describe the algorithm to find all the sub-palindromes with odd length, i. e. to calculate $d_{odd}[]$.

    For fast calculation we'll maintain the **borders $(l, r)$** of the rightmost found (sub-)palindrome (i. e. the current rightmost (sub-)palindrome is $s[l+1] s[l+2] \dots s[r-1]$). Initially we set $l = 0, r = 1$, which corresponds to the empty string.

    So, we want to calculate $d_{odd}[i]$ for the next $i$, and all the previous values in $d_{odd}[]$ have been already calculated. We do the following:

    * If $i$ is outside the current sub-palindrome, i. e. $i \geq r$, we'll just launch the trivial algorithm.
    
        So we'll increase $d_{odd}[i]$ consecutively and check each time if the current rightmost substring $[i - d_{odd}[i]\dots i + d_{odd}[i]]$ is a palindrome. When we find the first mismatch or meet the boundaries of $s$, we'll stop. In this case we've finally calculated $d_{odd}[i]$. After this, we must not forget to update $(l, r)$. $r$ should be updated in such a way that it represents the last index of the current rightmost sub-palindrome.

    * Now consider the case when $i \le r$. We'll try to extract some information from the already calculated values in $d_{odd}[]$. So, let's find the "mirror" position of $i$ in the sub-palindrome $(l, r)$, i.e. we'll get the position $j = l + (r - i)$, and we check the value of $d_{odd}[j]$. Because $j$ is the position symmetrical to $i$ with respect to $(l+r)/2$, we can **almost always** assign $d_{odd}[i] = d_{odd}[j]$. Illustration of this (palindrome around $j$ is actually "copied" into the palindrome around $i$):
    
        $$
        \ldots\ 
        \overbrace{
            s_{l+1}\ \ldots\ 
            \underbrace{
                s_{j-d_{odd}[j]+1}\ \ldots\ s_j\ \ldots\ s_{j+d_{odd}[j]-1}\ 
            }_\text{palindrome}\ 
            \ldots\ 
            \underbrace{
                s_{i-d_{odd}[j]+1}\ \ldots\ s_i\ \ldots\ s_{i+d_{odd}[j]-1}\ 
            }_\text{palindrome}\ 
            \ldots\ s_{r-1}\ 
        }^\text{palindrome}\ 
        \ldots
        $$
    
        But there is a **tricky case** to be handled correctly: when the "inner" palindrome reaches the borders of the "outer" one, i. e. $j - d_{odd}[j] \le l$ (or, which is the same, $i + d_{odd}[j] \ge r$). Because the symmetry outside the "outer" palindrome is not guaranteed, just assigning $d_{odd}[i] = d_{odd}[j]$ will be incorrect: we do not have enough data to state that the palindrome in the position $i$ has the same length.
    
        Actually, we should restrict the length of our palindrome for now, i. e. assign $d_{odd}[i] = r - i$, to handle such situations correctly. After this we'll run the trivial algorithm which will try to increase $d_{odd}[i]$ while it's possible.
    
        Illustration of this case (the palindrome with center $j$ is restricted to fit the "outer" palindrome):
    
        $$
        \ldots\ 
        \overbrace{
            \underbrace{
                s_{l+1}\ \ldots\ s_j\ \ldots\ s_{j+(j-l)-1}\ 
            }_\text{palindrome}\ 
            \ldots\ 
            \underbrace{
                s_{i-(r-i)+1}\ \ldots\ s_i\ \ldots\ s_{r-1}
            }_\text{palindrome}\ 
        }^\text{palindrome}\ 
        \underbrace{
            \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots \ldots
        }_\text{try moving here}
        $$
    
        It is shown in the illustration that though the palindrome with center $j$ could be larger and go outside the "outer" palindrome, but with $i$ as the center we can use only the part that entirely fits into the "outer" palindrome. But the answer for the position $i$ ($d_{odd}[i]$) can be much bigger than this part, so next we'll run our trivial algorithm that will try to grow it outside our "outer" palindrome, i. e. to the region "try moving here".

    Again, we should not forget to update the values $(l, r)$ after calculating each $d_{odd}[i]$.

    ## Complexity of Manacher's algorithm

    At the first glance it's not obvious that this algorithm has linear time complexity, because we often run the naive algorithm while searching the answer for a particular position.

    However, a more careful analysis shows that the algorithm is linear. In fact, [Z-function building algorithm](/string/z-function.html), which looks similar to this algorithm, also works in linear time.

    We can notice that every iteration of trivial algorithm increases $r$ by one. Also $r$ cannot be decreased during the algorithm. So, trivial algorithm will make $O(n)$ iterations in total.

    Other parts of Manacher's algorithm work obviously in linear time. Thus, we get $O(n)$ time complexity.

    ## Implementation of Manacher's algorithm

    For calculating $d_{odd}[]$, we get the following code. Things to note:

     - $i$ is the index of the center letter of the current palindrome.
     - If $i$ exceeds $r$, $d_{odd}[i]$ is initialized to 0.
     - If $i$ does not exceed $r$, $d_{odd}[i]$ is either initialized to the $d_{odd}[j]$, where $j$ is the mirror position of $i$ in $(l,r)$, or $d_{odd}[i]$ is restricted to the size of the "outer" palindrome.
     - The while loop denotes the trivial algorithm. We launch it irrespective of the value of $k$.
     - If the size of palindrome centered at $i$ is $x$, then $d_{odd}[i]$ stores $\frac{x+1}{2}$.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        s = "$" + s + "^";
        vector<int> p(n + 2);
        int l = 1, r = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            p[i] = max(0, min(r - i, p[l + (r - i)]));
            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {
                p[i]++;
            }
            if(i + p[i] > r) {
                l = i - p[i], r = i + p[i];
            }
        }
        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);
    }
    ```

    ## Working with parities

    Although it is possible to implement Manacher's algorithm for odd and even lengths separately, the implementation of the version for even lengths is often deemed more difficult, as it is less natural and easily leads to off-by-one errors.

    To mitigate this, it is possible to reduce the whole problem to the case when we only deal with the palindromes of odd length. To do this, we can put an additional `#` character between each letter in the string and also in the beginning and the end of the string:

    $$abcbcba \to \#a\#b\#c\#b\#c\#b\#a\#,$$

    $$d = [1,2,1,2,1,4,1,8,1,4,1,2,1,2,1].$$

    As you can see, $d[2i]=2 d_{even}[i]+1$ and $d[2i+1]=2 d_{odd}[i]$ where $d$ denotes the Manacher array for odd-length palindromes in `#`-joined string, while $d_{odd}$ and $d_{even}$ correspond to the arrays defined above in the initial string.

    Indeed, `#` characters do not affect the odd-length palindromes, which are still centered in the initial string's characters, but now even-length palindromes of the initial string are odd-length palindromes of the new string centered in `#` characters.

    Note that $d[2i]$ and $d[2i+1]$ are essentially the increased by $1$ lengths of the largest odd- and even-length palindromes centered in $i$ correspondingly.

    The reduction is implemented in the following way:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> manacher(string s) {
        string t;
        for(auto c: s) {
            t += string("#") + c;
        }
        auto res = manacher_odd(t + "#");
        return vector<int>(begin(res) + 1, end(res) - 1);
    }
    ```

    For simplicity, splitting the array into $d_{odd}$ and $d_{even}$ as well as their explicit calculation is omitted.

    Title: Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$
    Part: 1/2
    # Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$

    ## Statement

    Given string $s$ with length $n$. Find all the pairs $(i, j)$ such that substring $s[i\dots j]$ is a palindrome. String $t$ is a palindrome when $t = t_{rev}$ ($t_{rev}$ is a reversed string for $t$).

    ## More precise statement

    In the worst case string might have up to $O(n^2)$ palindromic substrings, and at the first glance it seems that there is no linear algorithm for this problem.

    But the information about the palindromes can be kept **in a compact way**: for each position $i$ we will find the number of non-empty palindromes centered at this position.

    Palindromes with a common center form a contiguous chain, that is if we have a palindrome of length $l$ centered in $i$, we also have palindromes of lengths $l-2$, $l-4$ and so on also centered in $i$. Therefore, we will collect the information about all palindromic substrings in this way.

    Palindromes of odd and even lengths are accounted for separately as $d_{odd}[i]$ and $d_{even}[i]$. For the palindromes of even length we assume that they're centered in the position $i$ if their two central characters are $s[i]$ and $s[i-1]$.

    For instance, string $s = abababc$ has three palindromes with odd length with centers in the position $s[3] = b$, i. e. $d_{odd}[3] = 3$:

    $$a\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{b}_{s_3}\ a\ b}^{d_{odd}[3]=3} c$$

    And string $s = cbaabd$ has two palindromes with even length with centers in the position $s[3] = a$, i. e. $d_{even}[3] = 2$:

    $$c\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{a}_{s_3}\ b}^{d_{even}[3]=2} d$$

    It's a surprising fact that there is an algorithm, which is simple enough, that calculates these "palindromity arrays" $d_{odd}[]$ and $d_{even}[]$ in linear time. The algorithm is described in this article.

    ## Solution

    In general, this problem has many solutions: with [String Hashing](/string/string-hashing.html) it can be solved in $O(n\cdot \log n)$, and with [Suffix Trees](/string/suffix-tree-ukkonen.html) and fast LCA this problem can be solved in $O(n)$.

    But the method described here is **sufficiently** simpler and has less hidden constant in time and memory complexity. This algorithm was discovered by **Glenn K. Manacher** in 1975.

    Another modern way to solve this problem and to deal with palindromes in general is through the so-called palindromic tree, or eertree.

    ## Trivial algorithm

    To avoid ambiguities in the further description we denote what "trivial algorithm" is.

    It's the algorithm that does the following. For each center position $i$ it tries to increase the answer by one as long as it's possible, comparing a pair of corresponding characters each time.

    Such an algorithm is slow, it can calculate the answer only in $O(n^2)$.

    The implementation of the trivial algorithm is:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        s = "$" + s + "^";
        vector<int> p(n + 2);
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {
                p[i]++;
            }
        }
        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);
    }

    Part: 1/2
    # Finding repetitions

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.

    A **repetition** is two occurrences of a string in a row.
    In other words a repetition can be described by a pair of indices $i < j$ such that the substring $s[i \dots j]$ consists of two identical strings written after each other.

    The challenge is to **find all repetitions** in a given string $s$.
    Or a simplified task: find **any** repetition or find the **longest** repetition.

    The algorithm described here was published in 1982 by Main and Lorentz.

    ## Example

    Consider the repetitions in the following example string:

    $$acababaee$$

    The string contains the following three repetitions:

    - $s[2 \dots 5] = abab$
    - $s[3 \dots 6] = baba$
    - $s[7 \dots 7] = ee$

    Another example:

    $$abaaba$$

    Here there are only two repetitions

    - $s[0 \dots 5] = abaaba$
    - $s[2 \dots 3] = aa$

    ## Number of repetitions

    In general there can be up to $O(n^2)$ repetitions in a string of length $n$.
    An obvious example is a string consisting of $n$ times the same letter, in this case any substring of even length is a repetition.
    In general any periodic string with a short period will contain a lot of repetitions.

    On the other hand this fact does not prevent computing the number of repetitions in $O(n \log n)$ time, because the algorithm can give the repetitions in compressed form, in groups of several pieces at once.

    There is even the concept, that describes groups of periodic substrings with tuples of size four.
    It has been proven that we the number of such groups is at most linear with respect to the string length.

    Also, here are some more interesting results related to the number of repetitions:

      - The number of primitive repetitions (those whose halves are not repetitions) is at most $O(n \log n)$.
      - If we encode repetitions with tuples of numbers (called Crochemore triples) $(i,~ p,~ r)$ (where $i$ is the position of the beginning, $p$ the length of the repeating substring, and $r$ the number of repetitions), then all repetitions can be described with $O(n \log n)$ such triples.
      - Fibonacci strings, defined as 
    
        \[\begin{align}
        t_0 &= a, \\\\
        t_1 &= b, \\\\
        t_i &= t_{i-1} + t_{i-2},
        \end{align}\]
    
        are "strongly" periodic.
        The number of repetitions in the Fibonacci string $f_i$, even in the compressed with Crochemore triples, is $O(f_n \log f_n)$.
        The number of primitive repetitions is also $O(f_n \log f_n)$.

    ## Main-Lorentz algorithm

    The idea behind the Main-Lorentz algorithm is **divide-and-conquer**.

    It splits the initial string into halves, and computes the number of repetitions that lie completely in each halve by two recursive calls.
    Then comes the difficult part.
    The algorithm finds all repetitions starting in the first half and ending in the second half (which we will call **crossing repetitions**).
    This is the essential part of the Main-Lorentz algorithm, and we will discuss it in detail here.

    The complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms is well researched.
    The [master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)) says, that we will end up with an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm, if we can compute the crossing repetitions in $O(n)$ time.

    ### Search for crossing repetitions

    So we want to find all such repetitions that start in the first half of the string, let's call it $u$, and end in the second half, let's call it $v$:

    $$s = u + v$$

    Their lengths are approximately equal to the length of $s$ divided by two.

    Consider an arbitrary repetition and look at the middle character (more precisely the first character of the second half of the repetition).
    I.e. if the repetition is a substring $s[i \dots j]$, then the middle character is $(i + j + 1) / 2$.

    We call a repetition **left** or **right** depending on which string this character is located - in the string $u$ or in the string $v$.
    In other words a string is called left, if the majority of it lies in $u$, otherwise we call it right.

    We will now discuss how to find **all left repetitions**.
    Finding all right repetitions can be done in the same way.

    Let us denote the length of the left repetition by $2l$ (i.e. each half of the repetition has length $l$).
    Consider the first character of the repetition falling into the string $v$ (it is at position $|u|$ in the string $s$).
    It coincides with the character $l$ positions before it, let's denote this position $cntr$.

    We will fixate this position $cntr$, and **look for all repetitions at this position** $cntr$.

    For example:

    $$c ~ \underset{cntr}{a} ~ c ~ | ~ a ~ d ~ a$$

    The vertical lines divides the two halves.
    Here we fixated the position $cntr = 1$, and at this position we find the repetition $caca$.

    It is clear, that if we fixate the position $cntr$, we simultaneously fixate the length of the possible repetitions: $l = |u| - cntr$.
    Once we know how to find these repetitions, we will iterate over all possible values for $cntr$ from $0$ to $|u|-1$, and find all left crossover repetitions of length $l = |u|,~ |u|-1,~ \dots, 1$.

    ### Criterion for left crossing repetitions

    Now, how can we find all such repetitions for a fixated $cntr$?
    Keep in mind that there still can be multiple such repetitions.

    Let's again look at a visualization, this time for the repetition $abcabc$:

    $$\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ \overbrace{\underset{cntr}{b} ~ c}^{l_2} ~ \overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ | ~ \overbrace{b ~ c}^{l_2}$$

    Here we denoted the lengths of the two pieces of the repetition with $l_1$ and $l_2$:
    $l_1$ is the length of the repetition up to the position $cntr-1$, and $l_2$ is the length of the repetition from $cntr$ to the end of the half of the repetition.
    We have $2l = l_1 + l_2 + l_1 + l_2$ as the total length of the repetition.

    Let us generate **necessary and sufficient** conditions for such a repetition at position $cntr$ of length $2l = 2(l_1 + l_2) = 2(|u| - cntr)$:

    - Let $k_1$ be the largest number such that the first $k_1$ characters before the position $cntr$ coincide with the last $k_1$ characters in the string $u$:
  
    $$
    u[cntr - k_1 \dots cntr - 1] = u[|u| - k_1 \dots |u| - 1]
    $$
  
    - Let $k_2$ be the largest number such that the $k_2$ characters starting at position $cntr$ coincide with the first $k_2$ characters in the string $v$:

    $$  
      u[cntr \dots cntr + k_2 - 1] = v[0 \dots k_2 - 1]
    $$
  
    - Then we have a repetition exactly for any pair $(l_1,~ l_2)$ with

    $$
      \begin{align}
      l_1 &\le k_1, \\\\
      l_2 &\le k_2. \\\\
      \end{align}
    $$

    To summarize:

    - We fixate a specific position $cntr$.
    - All repetition which we will find now have length $2l = 2(|u| - cntr)$.
      There might be multiple such repetitions, they depend on the lengths $l_1$ and $l_2 = l - l_1$.
    - We find $k_1$ and $k_2$ as described above.
    - Then all suitable repetitions are the ones for which the lengths of the pieces $l_1$ and $l_2$ satisfy the conditions:

    $$
      \begin{align}
      l_1 + l_2 &= l = |u| - cntr \\\\
      l_1 &\le k_1, \\\\
      l_2 &\le k_2. \\\\
      \end{align}
    $$

    Therefore the only remaining part is how we can compute the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ quickly for every position $cntr$.
    Luckily we can compute them in $O(1)$ using the [Z-function](../string/z-function.md):

    - To can find the value $k_1$ for each position by calculating the Z-function for the string $\overline{u}$ (i.e. the reversed string $u$).
      Then the value $k_1$ for a particular $cntr$ will be equal to the corresponding value of the array of the Z-function.
    - To precompute all values $k_2$, we calculate the Z-function for the string $v + \# + u$ (i.e. the string $u$ concatenated with the separator character $\#$ and the string $v$).
      Again we just need to look up the corresponding value in the Z-function to get the $k_2$ value.

    So this is enough to find all left crossing repetitions.

    ### Right crossing repetitions

    For computing the right crossing repetitions we act similarly:
    we define the center $cntr$ as the character corresponding to the last character in the string $u$.
