    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and removes all characters that are located at odd indices (1-based) from that string. The output should be a new string containing only the characters that were at even indices.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and collect characters that are at even indices. Since Python uses 0-based indexing, we will collect characters at indices 0, 2, 4, etc. We can achieve this by using a loop or a list comprehension to filter out the characters based on their indices.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_odd(s: str) -> str:\n       initialize an empty list result\n       for index from 0 to length of s - 1:\n           if index is even:\n               append s[index] to result\n       return the joined string of result\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef remove_odd(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store characters at even indices\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the string using index\n    for index in range(len(s)):\n        # Check if the index is even\n        if index % 2 == 0:\n            # Append the character at the even index to the result list\n            result.append(s[index])\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return it\n    return ''.join(result)\n```",
