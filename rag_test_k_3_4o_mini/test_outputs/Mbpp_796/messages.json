This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):\n    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:\n\n    $$N_0 = \\binom{25}{5}$$\n\n    We will now calculate the number of \"bad\" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The \"bad\" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.\n\n    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \\ge 9$, and all other $x_i \\ge 0 ~ (i \\ne k)$ (they may be $\\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:\n\n    $$ | A_k | = \\binom{16}{5} $$\n\n    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \\ne p$) is equal to:\n\n    $$ \\left| A_k \\cap A_p \\right| = \\binom{7}{5}$$\n\n    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.\n\n    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:\n\n    $$\\binom{25}{5} - \\left(\\binom{6}{1} \\cdot \\binom{16}{5} - \\binom{6}{2} \\cdot \\binom{7}{5}\\right) $$\n\n    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval\n\n    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).\n\n    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.\n\n    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\\cdots k)$.\n\n    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:\n\n    $$ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{ r }{ p_i } \\right\\rfloor $$\n\n    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.\n\n    Here is a C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int solve (int n, int r) {\n    \tvector<int> p;\n    \tfor (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)\n    \t\tif (n % i == 0) {\n    \t\t\tp.push_back (i);\n    \t\t\twhile (n % i == 0)\n    \t\t\t\tn /= i;\n    \t\t}\n    \tif (n > 1)\n    \t\tp.push_back (n);\n\n    \tint sum = 0;\n    \tfor (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {\n    \t\tint mult = 1,\n    \t\t\tbits = 0;\n    \t\tfor (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)\n    \t\t\tif (msk & (1<<i)) {\n    \t\t\t\t++bits;\n    \t\t\t\tmult *= p[i];\n    \t\t\t}\n\n    \t\tint cur = r / mult;\n    \t\tif (bits % 2 == 1)\n    \t\t\tsum += cur;\n    \t\telse\n    \t\t\tsum -= cur;\n    \t}\n\n    \treturn r -

2x(a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\\cdots+a_n^2)\n    \\]\n    The last part does not depend on $x$,\n    so we can ignore it.\n    The remaining parts form a function\n    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n$.\n    This is a parabola opening upwards\n    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,\n    and the minimum value is the average\n    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,\n    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Bit manipulation\n    Section: Dynamic programming\n    Part: 2/2\n    $ and the values are as follows:\n    \\begin{multicols}{2}\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\texttt{value}[\\emptyset] = 3$\n    \\item $\\texttt{value}[\\{0\\}] = 1$\n    \\item $\\texttt{value}[\\{1\\}] = 4$\n    \\item $\\texttt{value}[\\{0,1\\}] = 5$\n    \\item $\\texttt{value}[\\{2\\}] = 5$\n    \\item $\\texttt{value}[\\{0,2\\}] = 1$\n    \\item $\\texttt{value}[\\{1,2\\}] = 3$\n    \\item $\\texttt{value}[\\{0,1,2\\}] = 3$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{multicols}\n    In this case, for example,\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\texttt{sum}(\\{0,2\\}) &= \\texttt{value}[\\emptyset]+\\texttt{value}[\\{0\\}]+\\texttt{value}[\\{2\\}]+\\texttt{value}[\\{0,2\\}] \\\\ \n                          &= 3 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 10.\n    \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation*}\n\n    Because there are a total of $2^n$ subsets,\n    one possible solution is to go through all\n    pairs of subsets in $O(2^{2n})$ time.\n    However, using dynamic programming, we\n    can solve the problem in $O(2^n n)$ time.\n    The idea is to focus on sums where the\n    elements that may be removed from $S$ are restricted.\n\n    Let $\\texttt{partial}(S,k)$ denote the sum of\n    values of subsets of $S$ with the restriction\n    that only elements $0 \\ldots k$\n    may be removed from $S$.\n    For example,\n    \\[\\texttt{partial}(\\{0,2\\},1)=\\texttt{value}[\\{2\\}]+\\texttt{value}[\\{0,2\\}],\\]\n    because we may only remove elements $0 \\ldots 1$.\n    We can calculate values of \\texttt{sum} using\n    values of \\texttt{partial}, because\n    \\[\\texttt{sum}(S) = \\texttt{partial}(S,n-1).\\]\n    The base cases for the function are\n    \\[\\texttt{partial}(S,-1)=\\texttt{value}[S],\\]\n    because in this case no elements can be removed from $S$.\n    Then, in the general case we can use the following recurrence:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\texttt{partial}(S,k) = \\begin{cases}\n                   \\texttt{partial}(S,k-1) & k \\notin S \\\\\n                   \\texttt{partial}(S,k-1) + \\texttt{partial}(S \\setminus \\{k\\},k-1) & k \\in S\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    Here we focus on the element $k$.\n    If $k \\in S$, we have two options: we may either keep $k$ in $S$\n    or remove it from $S$.\n\n    There is a particularly clever way to implement the\n    calculation of sums. We can declare an array\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int sum[1<<N];\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    that will contain the sum of each subset.\n    The array is initialized as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int s = 0; s < (1<<n); s++) {\n        sum[s] = value[s];\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    Then, we can fill the array as follows:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n        for (int s = 0; s < (1<<n); s++) {\n            if (s&(1<<k)) sum[s] += sum[s^(1<<k)];\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    This code calculates the values of $\\texttt{partial}(S,k)$\n    for $k=0 \\ldots n-1$ to the array \\texttt{sum}.\n    Since $\\texttt{partial}(S,k)$ is always based on\n    $\\texttt{partial}(S,k-1)$, we can reuse the array\n    \\texttt{sum}, which yields a very efficient implementation.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
