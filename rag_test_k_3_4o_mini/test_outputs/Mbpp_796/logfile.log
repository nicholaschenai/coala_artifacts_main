INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/796 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary as input, where the keys are strings and the values are integers. The function should calculate and return the total sum of all the integer values in the dictionary.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the values of the dictionary and keep a running total of these values. At the end of the iteration, we will return the total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function return_sum(dictionary):
       initialize total_sum to 0
       for each value in dictionary:
           add value to total_sum
       return total_sum
   ```

    # Initialize a variable to hold the total sum
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through each value in the dictionary
    for value in dictionary.values():
        # Add the current value to the total sum
        total_sum += value
    
    # Return the total sum of all values
    return total_sum

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.

    $ and the values are as follows:
    \begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\texttt{value}[\emptyset] = 3$
    \item $\texttt{value}[\{0\}] = 1$
    \item $\texttt{value}[\{1\}] = 4$
    \item $\texttt{value}[\{0,1\}] = 5$
    \item $\texttt{value}[\{2\}] = 5$
    \item $\texttt{value}[\{0,2\}] = 1$
    \item $\texttt{value}[\{1,2\}] = 3$
    \item $\texttt{value}[\{0,1,2\}] = 3$
    \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}
    In this case, for example,
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \texttt{sum}(\{0,2\}) &= \texttt{value}[\emptyset]+\texttt{value}[\{0\}]+\texttt{value}[\{2\}]+\texttt{value}[\{0,2\}] \\ 
                          &= 3 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 10.
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}

    Because there are a total of $2^n$ subsets,
    one possible solution is to go through all
    pairs of subsets in $O(2^{2n})$ time.
    However, using dynamic programming, we
    can solve the problem in $O(2^n n)$ time.
    The idea is to focus on sums where the
    elements that may be removed from $S$ are restricted.

    Let $\texttt{partial}(S,k)$ denote the sum of
    values of subsets of $S$ with the restriction
    that only elements $0 \ldots k$
    may be removed from $S$.
    For example,
    \[\texttt{partial}(\{0,2\},1)=\texttt{value}[\{2\}]+\texttt{value}[\{0,2\}],\]
    because we may only remove elements $0 \ldots 1$.
    We can calculate values of \texttt{sum} using
    values of \texttt{partial}, because
    \[\texttt{sum}(S) = \texttt{partial}(S,n-1).\]
    The base cases for the function are
    \[\texttt{partial}(S,-1)=\texttt{value}[S],\]
    because in this case no elements can be removed from $S$.
    Then, in the general case we can use the following recurrence:
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{partial}(S,k) = \begin{cases}
                   \texttt{partial}(S,k-1) & k \notin S \\
                   \texttt{partial}(S,k-1) + \texttt{partial}(S \setminus \{k\},k-1) & k \in S
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    Here we focus on the element $k$.
    If $k \in S$, we have two options: we may either keep $k$ in $S$
    or remove it from $S$.

    There is a particularly clever way to implement the
    calculation of sums. We can declare an array
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int sum[1<<N];
    \end{lstlisting}
    that will contain the sum of each subset.
    The array is initialized as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int s = 0; s < (1<<n); s++) {
        sum[s] = value[s];
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    Then, we can fill the array as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (int s = 0; s < (1<<n); s++) {
            if (s&(1<<k)) sum[s] += sum[s^(1<<k)];
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    This code calculates the values of $\texttt{partial}(S,k)$
    for $k=0 \ldots n-1$ to the array \texttt{sum}.
    Since $\texttt{partial}(S,k)$ is always based on
    $\texttt{partial}(S,k-1)$, we can reuse the array
    \texttt{sum}, which yields a very efficient implementation.
