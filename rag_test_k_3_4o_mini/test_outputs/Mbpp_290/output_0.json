    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each sublist in the input list of lists, keeping track of the longest sublist found so far. For each sublist, we will compare its length to the current maximum length. If it is longer, we will update our maximum length and the corresponding sublist.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_length(list_of_lists):\n       max_length = 0\n       longest_list = []\n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           if length of sublist > max_length:\n               max_length = length of sublist\n               longest_list = sublist\n       return (max_length, longest_list)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef max_length(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum length and the longest list\n    max_length = 0\n    longest_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Check if the current sublist is longer than the longest found so far\n        if len(sublist) > max_length:\n            max_length = len(sublist)  # Update the maximum length\n            longest_list = sublist      # Update the longest list\n    \n    # Return a tuple of the maximum length and the longest list\n    return (max_length, longest_list)\n```",
