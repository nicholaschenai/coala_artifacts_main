    Title: Circle-Circle Intersection
    Part: 1/1
    # Circle-Circle Intersection

    You are given two circles on a 2D plane, each one described as coordinates of its center and its radius. Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).

    ## Solution

    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).

    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$

    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$x \cdot (-2x_2) + y \cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$

    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:

    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$

    $$\begin{align}
    A &= -2x_2 \\
    B &= -2y_2 \\
    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2
    \end{align}$$

    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).

    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.

    Title: Circle-Line Intersection
    Part: 1/1
    # Circle-Line Intersection

    Given the coordinates of the center of a circle and its radius, and the equation of a line, you're required to find the points of intersection.

    ## Solution

    Instead of solving the system of two equations, we will approach the problem geometrically. This way we get a more accurate solution from the point of view of numerical stability.

    We assume without loss of generality that the circle is centered at the origin. If it's not, we translate it there and correct the $C$ constant in the line equation. So we have a circle centered at $(0,0)$ of radius $r$ and a line with equation $Ax+By+C=0$.

    Let's start by find the point on the line which is closest to the origin $(x_0, y_0)$. First, it has to be at a distance

    $$ d_0 = \frac{|C|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2}} $$

    Second, since the vector $(A, B)$ is perpendicular to the line, the coordinates of the point must be proportional to the coordinates of this vector. Since we know the distance of the point to the origin, we just need to scale the vector $(A, B)$ to this length, and we'll get:

    $$\begin{align}
    x_0 &= - \frac{AC}{A^2 + B^2} \\
    y_0 &= - \frac{BC}{A^2 + B^2} 
    \end{align}$$

    The minus signs are not obvious, but they can be easily verified by substituting $x_0$ and $y_0$ in the equation of the line.

    At this stage we can determine the number of intersection points, and even find the solution when there is one or zero points. Indeed, if the distance from $(x_0, y_0)$ to the origin $d_0$ is greater than the radius $r$, the answer is **zero points**. If $d_0=r$, the answer is **one point** $(x_0, y_0)$. If $d_0<r$, there are two points of intersection, and now we have to find their coordinates.

    So, we know that the point $(x_0, y_0)$ is inside the circle. The two points of intersection, $(a_x, a_y)$ and $(b_x, b_y)$, must belong to the line $Ax+By+C=0$ and must be at the same distance $d$ from $(x_0, y_0)$, and this distance is easy to find:

    $$ d = \sqrt{r^2 - \frac{C^2}{A^2 + B^2}} $$

    Note that the vector $(-B, A)$ is collinear to the line, and thus we can find the points in question by adding and subtracting  vector $(-B,A)$, scaled to the length $d$, to the point $(x_0, y_0)$. 

    Finally, the equations of the two points of intersection are:

    $$\begin{align}
    m &= \sqrt{\frac{d^2}{A^2 + B^2}} \\
    a_x &= x_0 + B \cdot m, a_y = y_0 - A \cdot m \\
    b_x &= x_0 - B \cdot m, b_y = y_0 + A \cdot m
    \end{align}$$

    Had we solved the original system of equations using algebraic methods, we would likely get an answer in a different form with a larger error. The geometric method described here is more graphic and more accurate.

    ## Implementation

    As indicated at the outset, we assume that the circle is centered at the origin, and therefore the input to the program is the radius $r$ of the circle and the parameters $A$, $B$ and $C$ of the equation of the line.

    ```cpp
    double r, a, b, c; // given as input
    double x0 = -a*c/(a*a+b*b), y0 = -b*c/(a*a+b*b);
    if (c*c > r*r*(a*a+b*b)+EPS)
        puts ("no points");
    else if (abs (c*c - r*r*(a*a+b*b)) < EPS) {
        puts ("1 point");
        cout << x0 << ' ' << y0 << '\n';
    }
    else {
        double d = r*r - c*c/(a*a+b*b);
        double mult = sqrt (d / (a*a+b*b));
        double ax, ay, bx, by;
        ax = x0 + b * mult;
        bx = x0 - b * mult;
        ay = y0 - a * mult;
        by = y0 + a * mult;
        puts ("2 points");
        cout << ax << ' ' << ay << '\n' << bx << ' ' << by << '\n';
    }
    ```

    \index{geometry}

    In geometric problems, it is often challenging
    to find a way to approach the problem so that
    the solution to the problem can be conveniently implemented
    and the number of special cases is small.

    As an example, consider a problem where
    we are given the vertices of a quadrilateral
    (a polygon that has four vertices),
    and our task is to calculate its area.
    For example, a possible input for the problem is as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]

    \draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (5,6) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[thick] (6,2) -- (5,6) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    One way to approach the problem is to divide
    the quadrilateral into two triangles by a straight
    line between two opposite vertices:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]

    \draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (5,6) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];

    \draw[thick] (6,2) -- (5,6) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);
    \draw[dashed,thick] (2,5) -- (6,2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    After this, it suffices to sum the areas
    of the triangles.
    The area of a triangle can be calculated,
    for example, using \key{Heron's formula}
    %\footnote{Heron of Alexandria (c. 10--70) was a Greek mathematician.}
    \[ \sqrt{s (s-a) (s-b) (s-c)},\]
    where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are the lengths
    of the triangle's sides and
    $s=(a+b+c)/2$.
    \index{Heron's formula}

    This is a possible way to solve the problem,
    but there is one pitfall:
    how to divide the quadrilateral into triangles?
    It turns out that sometimes we cannot just pick
    two arbitrary opposite vertices.
    For example, in the following situation,
    the division line is \emph{outside} the quadrilateral:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]

    \draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (3,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[thick] (6,2) -- (3,2) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);

    \draw[dashed,thick] (2,5) -- (6,2);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    However, another way to draw the line works:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]

    \draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (3,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[thick] (6,2) -- (3,2) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);

    \draw[dashed,thick] (3,2) -- (1,1);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    It is clear for a human which of the lines is the correct
    choice, but the situation is difficult for a computer.
                           
    However, it turns out that we can solve the problem using
    another method that is more convenient to a programmer.
    Namely, there is a general formula
    \[x_1y_2-x_2y_1+x_2y_3-x_3y_2+x_3y_4-x_4y_3+x_4y_1-x_1y_4,\]
    that calculates the area of a quadrilateral
    whose vertices are
    $(x_1,y_1)$,
    $(x_2,y_2)$,
    $(x_3,y_3)$ and
    $(x_4,y_4)$.
    This formula is easy to implement, there are no special
    cases, and we can even generalize the formula
    to \emph{all} polygons.

    \section{Complex numbers}

    \index{complex number}
    \index{point}
    \index{vector}

    A \key{complex number} is a number of the form $x+y i$,
    where $i = \sqrt{-1}$ is the \key{imaginary unit}.
    A geometric interpretation of a complex number is
    that it represents a two-dimensional point $(x,y)$
    or a vector from the origin to a point $(x,y)$.

    For example, $4+2i$ corresponds to the
    following point and vector:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]

    \draw[->,thick] (-5,0)--(5,0);
    \draw[->,thick] (0,-5)--(0,5);

    \draw[fill] (4,2) circle [radius=0.1];
    \draw[->,thick] (0,0)--(4-0.1,2-0.1);

    \node at (4,2.8) {$(4,2)$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \index{complex@\texttt{complex}}

    The C++ complex number class \texttt{complex} is
    useful when solving geometric problems.
    Using the class we can represent points and vectors
    as complex numbers, and the class contains tools
    that are useful in geometry.

    In the following code, \texttt{C} is the type of
    a coordinate and \texttt{P} is the type of a point or a vector.
    In addition, the code defines macros \texttt{X} and \texttt{Y}
    that can be used to refer to x and y coordinates.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    typedef long long C;
    typedef complex<C> P;
    #define X real()
    #define Y imag()
    \end{lstlisting}

    For example, the following code defines a point $p=(4,2)$
    and prints its x and y coordinates:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    P p = {4,2};
    cout << p.X << " " << p.Y << "\n"; // 4 2
    \end{lstlisting}

    The following code defines vectors $v=(3,1)$ and $u=(2,2)$,
    and after that calculates the sum $s=v+u$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    P v = {3,1};
    P u = {2,2};
    P s = v+u;
    cout << s.X << " " << s.Y << "\n"; // 5 3
    \end{lstlisting}

    In practice,
    an appropriate coordinate type is usually
    \texttt{long long} (integer) or \texttt{long double}
    (real number).
    It is a good idea to use integer whenever possible,
    because calculations with integers are exact.
    If real numbers are needed,
    precision errors should be taken into account
    when comparing numbers.
    A safe way to check if real numbers $a$ and $b$ are equal
    is to compare them using $|a-b|<\epsilon$,
    where $\epsilon$ is a small number (for example, $\epsilon=10^{-9}$).

    \subsubsection*{Functions}

    In the following examples, the coordinate type is
    \texttt{long double}.

    The function $\texttt{abs}(v)$ calculates the length
    $|v|$ of a vector $v=(x,y)$
    using the formula $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.
    The function can also be used for
    calculating the distance between points
    $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$,
    because that distance equals the length
    of the vector $(x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1)$.

    The following code calculates the distance
    between points $(4,2)$ and $(3,-1)$:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    P a = {4,2};
    P b = {3,-1};
    cout << abs(b-a) << "\n"; // 3.16228
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function $\texttt{arg}(v)$ calculates the
    angle of a vector $v=(x,y)$ with respect to the x axis.
    The function gives the angle in radians,
    where $r$ radians equals $180 r/\pi$ degrees.
    The angle of a vector that points to the right is 0,
    and angles decrease clockwise and increase
    counterclockwise.

    The function $\texttt{polar}(s,a)$ constructs a vector
    whose length is $s$ and that points to an angle $a$.
    A vector can be rotated by an angle $a$
    by multiplying it by a vector with length 1 and angle $a$.

    The following code calculates the angle of
    the vector $(4,2)$, rotates it $1/2$ radians
    counterclockwise, and then calculates the angle again:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    P v = {4,2};
    cout << arg(v) << "\n"; // 0.463648
    v *= polar(1.0,0.5);
    cout << arg(v) << "\n"; // 0.963648
    \end{lstlisting}
