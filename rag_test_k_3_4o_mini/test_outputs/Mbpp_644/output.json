    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes an array and a position (K) as inputs. The function should reverse the elements of the array from the start up to the K-th position, while leaving the rest of the array unchanged.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, we need to identify the subarray that we want to reverse, which consists of the first K elements of the array.\n   - We will reverse this subarray.\n   - Finally, we will concatenate the reversed subarray with the remaining elements of the original array (from position K to the end).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function reverse_Array_Upto_K(array, K):\n       if K is greater than the length of the array:\n           return \"K is out of bounds\"\n       create a new array to hold the result\n       reverse the first K elements of the array\n       append the remaining elements of the array to the result\n       return the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, K):\n    # Check if K is within the bounds of the array\n    if K > len(arr):\n        return \"K is out of bounds\"\n    \n    # Reverse the first K elements\n    reversed_part = arr[:K][::-1]\n    \n    # Concatenate the reversed part with the rest of the array\n    result = reversed_part + arr[K:]\n    \n    return result\n\n# The function is declared last as per the instructions.\n```",
