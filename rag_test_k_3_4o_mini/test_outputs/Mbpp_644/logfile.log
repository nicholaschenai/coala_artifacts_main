INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/644 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes an array (list) and a position (integer) as inputs. The function should reverse the elements of the array from the start up to the specified position, while keeping the rest of the array unchanged.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - First, we will check if the given position is valid (i.e., it should not exceed the length of the array).
   - We will then slice the array into two parts: the part that needs to be reversed (from the start to the given position) and the part that remains unchanged (from the position to the end).
   - We will reverse the first part and concatenate it with the unchanged part to form the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function reverse_Array_Upto_K(array, k):
       if k is greater than the length of array:
           set k to the length of array
       slice the array into two parts:
           part1 = array[0:k] (this part will be reversed)
           part2 = array[k:] (this part will remain unchanged)
       reverse part1
       concatenate reversed part1 with part2
       return the concatenated result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def reverse_Array_Upto_K(array, k):
    # Check if k exceeds the length of the array
    if k > len(array):
        k = len(array)  # Adjust k to the length of the array if necessary
    
    # Slice the array into two parts
    part1 = array[:k]  # This part will be reversed
    part2 = array[k:]  # This part will remain unchanged
    
    # Reverse part1
    part1.reverse()
    
    # Concatenate reversed part1 with part2
    return part1 + part2  # Return the final result

    Title: Josephus Problem
    Part: 1/1
    # Josephus Problem

    ## Statement

    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.
    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. 
    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.
    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.
    The process stops when one number remains.
    It is required to find the last number.

    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).

    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.
    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \log n)$.
    We want something better though.

    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution

    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.

    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:

    $$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
    n\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\
    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\
    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\
    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\
    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\
    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\
    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\
    \end{array}$$

    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:

    $$J_{n,k} = \left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \bmod n \right) + 1$$

    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$

    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:

    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \bmod n$$

    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.

    ## Implementation

    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;
    }
    ```

    **Non-recursive form** :

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
      	  res = (res + k) % i;
        return res + 1;
    }
    ```

    This formula can also be found analytically.
    Again here we assume 0-indexing.
    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.
    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \bmod n$.
    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \ \bmod n$.

    ## Modeling a $O(k \log n)$ solution

    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.
    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$) in one run without looping over.
    Afterwards we have $n - \lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k)$-th number.
    So we have to shift by that many.
    We can notice that $\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k$ is simply $-n \bmod k$.
    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.
    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.

    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.

    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;
        if (k == 1)
            return n-1;
        if (k > n)
            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;
        int cnt = n / k;
        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);
        res -= n % k;
        if (res < 0)
            res += n;
        else
            res += res / (k - 1);
        return res;
    }
    ```

    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:

    $$ n \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) ^ x = 1, $$

    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:

    $$\ln n + x \ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) = 0,$$ 
    $$x = - \frac{\ln n}{\ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)},$$

    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:

    $$x \approx k \ln n$$

    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \log n)$.

    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$

    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.

    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):

    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$

    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:

    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$

    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, "restarting" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:

    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \left(n-2^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor} \right)$$

    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$

    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler "The Josephus Problem" and Odlyzko, Wilf "Functional iteration and the Josephus problem").

    Title: Finding repetitions
    Part: 2/2
    Then the length $k_1$ will be defined as the largest number of characters before the position $cntr$ (inclusive) that coincide with the last characters of the string $u$.
    And the length $k_2$ will be defined as the largest number of characters starting at $cntr + 1$ that coincide with the characters of the string $v$.

    Thus we can find the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ by computing the Z-function for the strings $\overline{u} + \# + \overline{v}$ and $v$.

    After that we can find the repetitions by looking at all positions $cntr$, and use the same criterion as we had for left crossing repetitions.

    ### Implementation

    The implementation of the Main-Lorentz algorithm finds all repetitions in form of peculiar tuples of size four: $(cntr,~ l,~ k_1,~ k_2)$ in $O(n \log n)$ time.
    If you only want to find the number of repetitions in a string, or only want to find the longest repetition in a string, this information is enough and the runtime will still be $O(n \log n)$.

    Notice that if you want to expand these tuples to get the starting and end position of each repetition, then the runtime will be the runtime will be $O(n^2)$ (remember that there can be $O(n^2)$ repetitions).
    In this implementation we will do so, and store all found repetition in a vector of pairs of start and end indices.

    ```{.cpp file=main_lorentz}
    vector<int> z_function(string const& s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> z(n);
        for (int i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i <= r)
                z[i] = min(r-i+1, z[i-l]);
            while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i+z[i]])
                z[i]++;
            if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
                l = i;
                r = i + z[i] - 1;
            }
        }
        return z;
    }

            if (left && l1 == l) break;
            int l2 = l - l1;
            int pos = shift + (left ? cntr - l1 : cntr - l - l1 + 1);
            repetitions.emplace_back(pos, pos + 2*l - 1);
        }
    }

    void find_repetitions(string s, int shift = 0) {
        int n = s.size();

        string rv(v.rbegin(), v.rend());

            if (k1 + k2 >= l)

    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations
    Part: 1/1
    # Generating all $K$-combinations

    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.
    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.
    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.

    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label="Generate next lexicographical K-combination"}

    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.
    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how
    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our
    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once
    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent
    elements.

    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}
    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {
        int k = (int)a.size();
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {
                a[i]++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)
                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    ```

    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label="Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element"}

    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such
    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.

    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):
    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.

    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:
    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.
    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the
    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove
    a number, add a number).

    Let us prove this:

    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can 
    be obtained as follows:

    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \cup 1G(N-1)^\text{R}$$

    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the 
    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and
    concatenate these two sequences.

    Now we may produce our proof.

    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note
    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As
    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.
    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.

    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.

    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.

    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size
    $K$.

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}
    int gray_code (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }

    int count_bits (int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (; n; n >>= 1)
            res += n & 1;
        return res;
    }

    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            int cur = gray_code (i);
            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (cur & (1 << j))
                        cout << j + 1;
                }
                cout << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus
    works in $O\left(N \cdot \binom{N}{K}\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant
    than the previous solution.

    The implementation is derived from the formula:

    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\text{R}$$

    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the
    subsequence from appropriate elements.

    Its implementation is as follows:

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}
    vector<int> ans;

    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {
        if (k > n || k < 0)
            return;

        if (!n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {
                if (ans[i])
                    cout << i + 1;
            }
            cout << "\n";
            return;
        }

        ans[idx] = rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);
        ans[idx] = !rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);
    }

    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {
        ans.resize(n);
        gen(n, k, 0, false);
    }
    ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/644 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes an array and a position (K) as inputs. The function should reverse the elements of the array from the start up to the K-th position, while leaving the rest of the array unchanged.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - First, we need to identify the subarray that we want to reverse, which consists of the first K elements of the array.
   - We will reverse this subarray.
   - Finally, we will concatenate the reversed subarray with the remaining elements of the original array (from position K to the end).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function reverse_Array_Upto_K(array, K):
       if K is greater than the length of the array:
           return "K is out of bounds"
       create a new array to hold the result
       reverse the first K elements of the array
       append the remaining elements of the array to the result
       return the result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, K):
    # Check if K is within the bounds of the array
    if K > len(arr):
        return "K is out of bounds"
    
    # Reverse the first K elements
    reversed_part = arr[:K][::-1]
    
    # Concatenate the reversed part with the rest of the array
    result = reversed_part + arr[K:]
    
    return result

# The function is declared last as per the instructions.
