    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   The task is to create a function that finds the index where a specified value can be inserted into a sorted list while maintaining the order of the list. This index is referred to as the \"left insertion point.\" For example, if we have a sorted list `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and we want to insert the value `6`, the function should return `4`, which is the index where `6` would be inserted.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   To find the left insertion point, we can utilize a binary search approach. Since the list is sorted, we can efficiently narrow down the possible insertion index by comparing the target value with the middle element of the current search range. If the target value is greater than the middle element, we move our search to the right half; otherwise, we search the left half. This process continues until we find the correct insertion point.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function left_insertion(arr, value):\n       set left to 0\n       set right to length of arr\n       while left < right:\n           set mid to (left + right) // 2\n           if arr[mid] < value:\n               set left to mid + 1\n           else:\n               set right to mid\n       return left\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef left_insertion(arr, value):\n    left = 0  # Initialize the left boundary of the search\n    right = len(arr)  # Initialize the right boundary of the search\n    \n    while left < right:  # Continue searching while the left boundary is less than the right\n        mid = (left + right) // 2  # Find the middle index\n        if arr[mid] < value:  # If the middle element is less than the value\n            left = mid + 1  # Move the left boundary to mid + 1\n        else:  # If the middle element is greater than or equal to the value\n            right = mid  # Move the right boundary to mid\n    \n    return left  # The left boundary is the insertion point\n```",
