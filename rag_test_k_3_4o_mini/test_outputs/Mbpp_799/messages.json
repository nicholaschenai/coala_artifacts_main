Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n \t\n    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.\n        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.\n\n    -   $\\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.\n\n    Examples:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 01010000\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n | (n-1) = 01011111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    n-1       = 01010111\n    --------------------\n    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111\n    ```\n\n    ```\n    n         = 01011000\n    --------------------\n    ~n        = 10100111\n    ```\n\n    ### Shift operators\n\n    There are two operators for shifting bits.\n\n    -   $\\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.\n        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\gg 2 = 101_2 \\gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\\frac{5}{2^2} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1$.\n        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.\n\n    -   $\\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.\n        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.\n\n        E.g. $5 \\ll 3 = 101_2 \\ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \\cdot 2^3 = 5 \\cdot 8 = 40$.\n\n        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.\n\n\n    ## Useful tricks\n\n    ### Set/flip/clear a bit\n\n    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.\n    $1 \\ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\\sim(1 \\ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.\n\n    - $n ~|~ (1 \\ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\wedge~ (1 \\ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n    - $n ~\\&~ \\sim(1 \\ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$\n\n    ### Check if a bit is set\n\n    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {\n        return (number >> x) & 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2\n\n    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).\n    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.\n    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {\n        return n && !(n & (n - 1));\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Clear the most-right set bit\n\n    The expression $n ~\\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.\n    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.\n    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.\n\n    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:\n\n    ```\n    n         = 00110100\n    n-1       = 00110011\n    --------------------\n    n & (n-1) = 00110000\n    ```\n\n    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm\n\n    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.\n\n    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.\n\n    ``` cpp\n    int countSetBits(int n)\n    {\n        int count = 0;\n        while (n)\n        {\n            n = n & (n - 1);\n            count++;\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Balanced Ternary\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Balanced Ternary\n\n    ![\"Setun computer using Balanced Ternary system\"](https://earltcampbell.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/setun.jpeg?w=300)\n\n    This is a non-standard but still positional **numeral system**. Its feature is that digits can have one of the values `-1`, `0` and `1`.\n    Nevertheless, its base is still `3` (because there are three possible values). Since it is not convenient to write `-1` as a digit,\n    we'll use letter `Z` further for this purpose. If you think it is quite a strange system - look at the picture - here is one of the\n    computers utilizing it.\n\n    So here are few first numbers written in balanced ternary:\n\n    ```nohighlight\n        0    0\n        1    1\n        2    1Z\n        3    10\n        4    11\n        5    1ZZ\n        6    1Z0\n        7    1Z1\n        8    10Z\n        9    100\n    ```\n\n    This system allows you to write negative values without leading minus sign: you can simply invert digits in any positive number.\n\n    ```nohighlight\n        -1   Z\n        -2   Z1\n        -3   Z0\n        -4   ZZ\n        -5   Z11\n    ```\n\n    Note that a negative number starts with `Z` and positive with `1`.\n\n    ## Conversion algorithm\n\n    It is easy to represent a given number in **balanced ternary** via temporary representing it in normal ternary number system. When value is\n    in standard ternary, its digits are either `0` or `1` or `2`. Iterating from the lowest digit we can safely skip any `0`s and `1`s,\n    however `2` should be turned into `Z` with adding `1` to the next digit. Digits `3` should be turned into `0` on the same terms -\n    such digits are not present in the number initially but they can be encountered after increasing some `2`s.\n\n    **Example 1:** Let us convert `64` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n\n    $$ 64_{10} = 02101_{3} $$\n\n    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:\n\n    - `1`,`0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `1Z101`.\n\n    The final result is `1Z101`.\n\n    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n\n    $$ 1Z101 = 81 \\cdot 1 + 27 \\cdot (-1) + 9 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 1 = 64_{10} $$\n\n    **Example 2:** Let us convert `237` to balanced ternary. At first we use normal ternary to rewrite the number:\n\n    $$ 237_{10} = 22210_{3} $$\n\n    Let us process it from the least significant (rightmost) digit:\n\n    - `0` and `1` are skipped as it is.( Because `0` and `1` are allowed in balanced ternary )\n    - `2` is turned into `Z` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `23Z10`.\n    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left, so we get `30Z10`.\n    - `3` is turned into `0` increasing the digit to its left( which is by default `0` ), and so we get `100Z10`.\n\n    The final result is `100Z10`.\n\n    Let us convert it back to the decimal system by adding the weighted positional values:\n\n    $$ 100Z10 = 243 \\cdot 1 + 81 \\cdot 0 + 27 \\cdot 0 + 9 \\cdot (-1) + 3 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 237_{10} $$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Binary Exponentiation by Factoring\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Binary Exponentiation by Factoring\n\n    Consider a problem of computing $ax^y \\pmod{2^d}$, given integers $a$, $x$, $y$ and $d \\geq 3$, where $x$ is odd.\n\n    The algorithm below allows to solve this problem with $O(d)$ additions and binary operations and a single multiplication by $y$.\n\n    Due to the structure of the multiplicative group modulo $2^d$, any number $x$ such that $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ can be represented as\n\n    $$\n    x \\equiv b^{L(x)} \\pmod{2^d},\n    $$\n\n    where $b \\equiv 5 \\pmod 8$. Without loss of generality we assume that $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, as we can reduce $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$ to $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ by substituting $x \\mapsto -x$ and $a \\mapsto (-1)^{y} a$. In this notion, $ax^y$ is represented as\n\n    $$\n    a x^y \\equiv a b^{yL(x)} \\pmod{2^d}.\n    $$\n\n    The core idea of the algorithm is to simplify the computation of $L(x)$ and $b^{y L(x)}$ using the fact that we're working modulo $2^d$. For reasons that will be apparent later on, we'll be working with $4L(x)$ rather than $L(x)$, but taken modulo $2^d$ instead of $2^{d-2}$.\n\n    In this article, we will cover the implementation for $32$-bit integers. Let\n\n    * `mbin_log_32(r, x)` be a function that computes $r+4L(x) \\pmod{2^d}$;\n    * `mbin_exp_32(r, x)` be a function that computes $r b^{\\frac{x}{4}} \\pmod{2^d}$;\n    * `mbin_power_odd_32(a, x, y)` be a function that computes $ax^y \\pmod{2^d}$.\n\n    Then `mbin_power_odd_32` is implemented as follows:\n\n    ```cpp\n    uint32_t mbin_power_odd_32(uint32_t rem, uint32_t base, uint32_t exp) {\n        if (base & 2) {\n            /* divider is considered negative */\n            base = -base;\n            /* check if result should be negative */\n            if (exp & 1) {\n                rem = -rem;\n            }\n        }\n        return (mbin_exp_32(rem, mbin_log_32(0, base) * exp));\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Computing 4L(x) from x\n\n    Let $x$ be an odd number such that $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. It can be represented as \n\n    $$\n    x \\equiv (2^{a_1}+1)\\dots(2^{a_k}+1) \\pmod{2^d},\n    $$\n\n    where $1 < a_1 < \\dots < a_k < d$. Here $L(\\cdot)$ is well-defined for each multiplier, as they're equal to $1$ modulo $4$. Hence,\n\n    $$\n    4L(x) \\equiv 4L(2^{a_1}+1)+\\dots+4L(2^{a_k}+1) \\pmod{2^{d}}.\n    $$\n\n    So, if we precompute $t_k = 4L(2^n+1)$ for all $1 < k < d$, we will be able to compute $4L(x)$ for any number $x$.\n\n    For 32-bit integers, we can use the following table:\n\n    ```cpp\n    const uint32_t mbin_log_32_table[32] = {\n        0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0xd3cfd984, 0x9ee62e18,\n        0xe83d9070, 0xb59e81e0, 0xa17407c0, 0xce601f80,\n        0xf4807f00, 0xe701fe00, 0xbe07fc00, 0xfc1ff800,\n        0xf87ff000, 0xf1ffe000, 0xe7ffc000, 0xdfff8000,\n        0xffff0000, 0xfffe0000, 0xfffc0000, 0xfff80000,\n        0xfff00000, 0xffe00000, 0xffc00000, 0xff800000,\n        0xff000000, 0xfe000000, 0xfc000000, 0xf8000000,\n        0xf0000000, 0xe0000000, 0xc0000000, 0x80000000,\n    };\n    ```\n\n    On practice, a slightly different approach is used than described above. Rather than finding the factorization for $x$, we will consequently multiply $x$ with $2^n+1$ until we turn it into $1$ modulo $2^d$. In this way, we will find the representation of $x^{-1}$, that is\n\n    $$\n    x (2^{a_1}+1)\\dots(2^{a_k}+1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod {2^d}.\n    $$\n\n    To do this, we iterate over $n$ such that $1 < n < d$. If the current $x$ has $n$-th bit set, we multiply $x$ with $2^n+1$, which is conveniently done in C++ as `x = x + (x << n)`. This won't change bits lower than $n$, but will turn the $n$-th bit to zero, because $x$ is odd.\n\n    With all this in mind, the function `mbin_log_32(r, x)` is implemented as follows:\n\n    ```cpp\n    uint32_t mbin_log_32(uint32_t r, uint32_t x) {\n        uint8_t n;\n\n        for (n = 2; n < 32; n++) {\n            if (x & (1 << n)) {\n                x = x + (x << n);\n                r -= mbin_log_32_table[n];\n            }\n        }\n\n        return r;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Note that $4L(x) = -4L(x^{-1})$, so instead of adding $4L(2^n+1)$, we subtract it from $r$, which initially equates to $0$.\n\n    ## Computing x from 4L(x)\n\n    Note that for $k \\geq 1$ it holds that\n\n    $$\n    (a 2^{k}+1)^2 = a^2 2^{2k} +a 2^{k+1}+1 = b2^{k+1}+1,\n    $$\n\n    from which (by repeated squaring) we can deduce that\n\n    $$\n    (2^a+1)^{2^b} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{a+b}}.\n    $$\n\n    Applying this result to $a=2^n+1$ and $b=d-k$ we deduce that the multiplicative order of $2^n+1$ is a divisor of $2^{d-n}$.\n\n    This, in turn, means that $L(2^n+1)$ must be divisible by $2^{n}$, as the order of $b$ is $2^{d-2}$ and the order of $b^y$ is $2^{d-2-v}$, where $2^v$ is the highest power of $2$ that divides $y$, so we need\n\n    $$\n    2^{d-k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2^{d-2-v}},\n    $$\n\n    thus $v$ must be greater or equal than $k-2$. This is a bit ugly and to mitigate this we said in the beginning that we multiply $L(x)$ by $4$. Now if we know $4L(x)$, we can uniquely decomposing it into a sum of $4L(2^n+1)$ by consequentially checking bits in $4L(x)$. If the $n$-th bit is set to $1$, we will multiply the result with $2^n+1$ and reduce the current $4L(x)$ by $4L(2^n+1)$.\n\n    Thus, `mbin_exp_32` is implemented as follows:\n\n    ```cpp\n    uint32_t mbin_exp_32(uint32_t r, uint32_t x) {\n        uint8_t n;\n\n        for (n = 2; n < 32; n++) {\n            if (x & (1 << n)) {\n                r = r + (r << n);\n                x -= mbin_log_32_table[n];\n            }\n        }\n\n        return r;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Further optimizations\n\n    It is possible to halve the number of iterations if you note that $4L(2^{d-1}+1)=2^{d-1}$ and that for $2k \\geq d$ it holds that\n\n    $$\n    (2^n+1)^2 \\equiv 2^{2n} + 2^{n+1}+1 \\equiv 2^{n+1}+1 \\pmod{2^d},\n    $$\n\n    which allows to deduce that $4L(2^n+1)=2^n$ for $2n \\geq d$. So, you could simplify the algorithm by only going up to $\\frac{d}{2}$ and then use the fact above to compute the remaining part with bitwise operations:\n\n    ```cpp\n    uint32_t mbin_log_32(uint32_t r, uint32_t x) {\n        uint8_t n;\n\n        for (n = 2; n != 16; n++) {\n            if (x & (1 << n)) {\n                x = x + (x << n);\n                r -= mbin_log_32_table[n];\n            }\n        }\n\n        r -= (x & 0xFFFF0000);\n\n        return r;\n    }\n\n    uint32_t mbin_exp_32(uint32_t r, uint32_t x) {\n        uint8_t n;\n\n        for (n = 2; n != 16; n++) {\n            if (x & (1 << n)) {\n                r = r + (r << n);\n                x -= mbin_log_32_table[n];\n            }\n        }\n\n        r *= 1 - (x & 0xFFFF0000);\n\n        return r;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Computing logarithm table\n\n    To compute log-table, one could modify the [Pohlig\u2013Hellman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pohlig\u2013Hellman_algorithm) for the case when modulo is a power of $2$.\n\n    Our main task here is to compute $x$ such that $g^x \\equiv y \\pmod{2^d}$, where $g=5$ and $y$ is a number of kind $2^n+1$. \n\n    Squaring both parts $k$ times we arrive to\n\n    $$\n    g^{2^k x} \\equiv y^{2^k} \\pmod{2^d}.\n    $$\n\n    Note that the order of $g$ is not greater than $2^{d}$ (in fact, than $2^{d-2}$, but we will stick to $2^d$ for convenience), hence using $k=d-1$ we will have either $g^1$ or $g^0$ on the left hand side which allows us to determine the smallest bit of $x$ by comparing $y^{2^k}$ to $g$. Now assume that $x=x_0 + 2^k x_1$, where $x_0$ is a known part and $x_1$ is not yet known. Then\n\n    $$\n    g^{x_0+2^k x_1} \\equiv y \\pmod{2^d}.\n    $$\n\n    Multiplying both parts with $g^{-x_0}$, we get\n\n    $$\n    g^{2^k x_1} \\equiv (g^{-x_0} y) \\pmod{2^d}.\n    $$\n\n    Now, squaring both sides $d-k-1$ times we can obtain the next bit of $x$, eventually recovering all its bits.\n\n    ## References\n\n    * [M30, Hans Petter Selasky, 2009](https://ia601602.us.archive.org/29/items/B-001-001-251/B-001-001-251.pdf#page=640)\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

For example, if we take the number 16 (which is `00000000 00000000 00000000 00010000` in binary) and rotate it left by 2 positions, the result should be 64 (which is `00000000 00000000 00000001 00000000` in binary).\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To rotate the bits of a number to the left, we can use bitwise operations. The left rotation can be achieved by:\n   - Shifting the number to the left by `d` positions.\n   - Shifting the number to the right by `(32 - d)` positions to capture the bits that overflowed from the left side.\n   - Combining these two results using the bitwise OR operator.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function left_rotate(n, d):\n       # Ensure d is within the bounds of 0 to 31\n       d = d % 32\n       # Shift n left by d and wrap around the bits that overflow\n       left_shifted = n << d\n       right_shifted = n >> (32 - d)\n       # Combine the two results\n       return left_shifted | right_shifted\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef left_rotate(n: int, d: int) -> int:\n    # Ensure d is within the bounds of 0 to 31\n    d = d % 32\n    # Shift n left by d and wrap around the bits that overflow\n    left_shifted = n << d\n    right_shifted = n >> (32 - d)\n    # Combine the two results\n    return left_shifted | right_shifted\n```"
