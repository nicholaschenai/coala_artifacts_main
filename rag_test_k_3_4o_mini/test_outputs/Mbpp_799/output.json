    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that rotates the bits of a given 32-bit integer to the left by a specified number of positions. For example, if we take the number 16 (which is `00000000 00000000 00000000 00010000` in binary) and rotate it left by 2 positions, the result should be 64 (which is `00000000 00000000 00000001 00000000` in binary).\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To rotate the bits of a number to the left, we can use bitwise operations. The left rotation can be achieved by:\n   - Shifting the number to the left by `d` positions.\n   - Shifting the number to the right by `(32 - d)` positions to capture the bits that overflowed from the left side.\n   - Combining these two results using the bitwise OR operator.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function left_rotate(n, d):\n       # Ensure d is within the bounds of 0 to 31\n       d = d % 32\n       # Shift n left by d and wrap around the bits that overflow\n       left_shifted = n << d\n       right_shifted = n >> (32 - d)\n       # Combine the two results\n       return left_shifted | right_shifted\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef left_rotate(n: int, d: int) -> int:\n    # Ensure d is within the bounds of 0 to 31\n    d = d % 32\n    # Shift n left by d and wrap around the bits that overflow\n    left_shifted = n << d\n    right_shifted = n >> (32 - d)\n    # Combine the two results\n    return left_shifted | right_shifted\n```",
