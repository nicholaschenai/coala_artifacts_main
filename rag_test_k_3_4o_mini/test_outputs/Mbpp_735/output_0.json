    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes an integer as input and toggles (flips) all the bits of that integer except for the first and last bits. The first bit is the most significant bit (leftmost), and the last bit is the least significant bit (rightmost).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can convert the integer to its binary representation. We will then identify the first and last bits and toggle all the bits in between. Finally, we will convert the modified binary representation back to an integer and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function toggle_middle_bits(n):\n       if n is less than 4:\n           return n  # No middle bits to toggle\n       convert n to binary string\n       keep the first and last bits unchanged\n       toggle all bits in between\n       convert the modified binary string back to an integer\n       return the new integer\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef toggle_middle_bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # If the number is less than 4, return it as is (no middle bits to toggle)\n    if n < 4:\n        return n\n    \n    # Convert the number to binary and remove the '0b' prefix\n    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]\n    \n    # Get the first and last bits\n    first_bit = binary_str[0]\n    last_bit = binary_str[-1]\n    \n    # Toggle the middle bits\n    middle_bits = ''.join('1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in binary_str[1:-1])\n    \n    # Construct the new binary string\n    new_binary_str = first_bit + middle_bits + last_bit\n    \n    # Convert the new binary string back to an integer\n    return int(new_binary_str, 2)\n\n# The function is declared last as per the instructions.\n```",
