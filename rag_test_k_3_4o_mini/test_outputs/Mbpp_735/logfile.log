INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/735 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes an integer as input and toggles (flips) all the bits of that number except for the first and the last bits. The first bit is the most significant bit (leftmost), and the last bit is the least significant bit (rightmost).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - Convert the integer to its binary representation.
   - Identify the first and last bits.
   - Toggle all the bits in between the first and last bits.
   - Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function toggle_middle_bits(n):
       convert n to binary string
       if length of binary string is less than 3:
           return n (no middle bits to toggle)

    # Bit manipulation

    ## Binary number

    A **binary number** is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, it is a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).

    We say that a certain bit is **set**, if it is one, and **cleared** if it is zero.

    The binary number $(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2$ represents the number:

    $$(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2 = a_k \cdot 2^k + a_{k-1} \cdot 2^{k-1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot 2^1 + a_0 \cdot 2^0.$$

    For instance the binary number $1101_2$ represents the number $13$:

    $$\begin{align}
    1101_2 &= 1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 \\
           &= 1\cdot 8 + 1 \cdot 4 + 0 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 = 13
    \end{align}$$

    Computers represent integers as binary numbers.
    Positive integers (both signed and unsigned) are just represented with their binary digits, and negative signed numbers (which can be positive and negative) are usually represented with the [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).

    ```cpp
    unsigned int unsigned_number = 13;
    assert(unsigned_number == 0b1101);

    int positive_signed_number = 13;
    assert(positive_signed_number == 0b1101);

    int negative_signed_number = -13;
    assert(negative_signed_number == 0b1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'0011);
    ```

    CPUs are very fast manipulating those bits with specific operations.
    For some problems we can take these binary number representations to our advantage, and speed up the execution time.
    And for some problems (typically in combinatorics or dynamic programming) where we want to track which objects we already picked from a given set of objects, we can just use an large enough integer where each digit represents an object and depending on if we pick or drop the object we set or clear the digit.

    ## Bit operators

    All those introduced operators are instant (same speed as an addition) on a CPU for fixed-length integers.

    ### Bitwise operators

    -   $\&$ : The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand. 
        If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.
 	
    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.

    Examples:

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 01010000
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n | (n-1) = 01011111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    --------------------
    ~n        = 10100111
    ```

    ### Shift operators

    There are two operators for shifting bits.

    -   $\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.
        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \gg 2 = 101_2 \gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\frac{5}{2^2} = \frac{5}{4} = 1$.
        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.

    -   $\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.
        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \ll 3 = 101_2 \ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \cdot 2^3 = 5 \cdot 8 = 40$.

        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.


    ## Useful tricks

    ### Set/flip/clear a bit

    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.
    $1 \ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\sim(1 \ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.

    - $n ~|~ (1 \ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\wedge~ (1 \ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\&~ \sim(1 \ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$

    ### Check if a bit is set

    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.

    ``` cpp
    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {
        return (number >> x) & 1;
    }
    ```

    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2

    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).
    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.
    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.

    ``` cpp
    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {
        return n && !(n & (n - 1));
    }
    ```

    ### Clear the most-right set bit

    The expression $n ~\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.
    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.
    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.

    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:

    ```
    n         = 00110100
    n-1       = 00110011
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 00110000
    ```

    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm

    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.

    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.

    ``` cpp
    int countSetBits(int n)
    {
        int count = 0;
        while (n)
        {
            n = n & (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    ### Additional tricks

    - $n ~\&~ (n + 1)$ clears all trailing ones: $0011~0111_2 \rightarrow 0011~0000_2$.
    - $n ~|~ (n + 1)$ sets the last cleared bit: $0011~0101_2 \rightarrow 0011~0111_2$.
    - $n ~\&~ -n$ extracts the last set bit: $0011~0100_2 \rightarrow 0000~0100_2$.

    Many more can be found in the book [Hacker's Delight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker%27s_Delight).

    ### Language and compiler support

    C++ supports some of those operations since C++20 via the [bit](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/bit) standard library:

    - `has_single_bit`: checks if the number is a power of two
    - `bit_ceil` / `bit_floor`: round up/down to the next power of two
    - `rotl` / `rotr`: rotate the bits in the number
    - `countl_zero` / `countr_zero` / `countl_one` / `countr_one`: count the leading/trailing zeros/ones
    - `popcount`: count the number of set bits

    Additionally, there are also predefined functions in some compilers that help working with bits.
    E.g. GCC defines a list at [Built-in Functions Provided by GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html) that also work in older versions of C++:

    - `__builtin_popcount(unsigned int)` returns the number of set bits (`__builtin_popcount(0b0001'0010'1100) == 4`)
    - `__builtin_ffs(int)` finds the index of the first (most right) set bit (`__builtin_ffs(0b0001'0010'1100) == 3`)
    - `__builtin_clz(unsigned int)` the count of leading zeros (`__builtin_clz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 23`)
    - `__builtin_ctz(unsigned int)` the count of trailing zeros (`__builtin_ctz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 2`)

    _Note that some of the operations (both the C++20 functions and the Compiler Built-in ones) might be quite slow in GCC if you don't enable a specific compiler target with `#pragma GCC target("popcnt")`._

    Title: Gray code
    Part: 1/1
    # Gray code

    Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit. 

    For example, the sequence of Gray codes for 3-bit numbers is: 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100, so $G(4) = 6$.

    This code was invented by Frank Gray in 1953.

    ## Finding Gray code

    Let's look at the bits of number $n$ and the bits of number $G(n)$. Notice that $i$-th bit of $G(n)$ equals 1 only when $i$-th bit of $n$ equals 1 and $i + 1$-th bit equals 0 or the other way around ($i$-th bit equals 0 and $i + 1$-th bit equals 1). Thus, $G(n) = n \oplus (n >> 1)$:  

    ```cpp
    int g (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }
    ```

    ## Finding inverse Gray code

    Given Gray code $g$, restore the original number $n$.

    We will move from the most significant bits to the least significant ones (the least significant bit has index 1 and the most significant bit has index $k$). The relation between the bits $n_i$ of number $n$ and the bits $g_i$ of number $g$:

    $$\begin{align}
      n_k &= g_k, \\
      n_{k-1} &= g_{k-1} \oplus n_k = g_k \oplus g_{k-1}, \\
      n_{k-2} &= g_{k-2} \oplus n_{k-1} = g_k \oplus g_{k-1} \oplus g_{k-2}, \\
      n_{k-3} &= g_{k-3} \oplus n_{k-2} = g_k \oplus g_{k-1} \oplus g_{k-2} \oplus g_{k-3},
      \vdots
    \end{align}$$

    The easiest way to write it in code is:

    ```cpp
    int rev_g (int g) {
      int n = 0;
      for (; g; g >>= 1)
        n ^= g;
      return n;
    }
    ```

    ## Practical applications
    Gray codes have some useful applications, sometimes quite unexpected:

    *   Gray code of $n$ bits forms a Hamiltonian cycle on a hypercube, where each bit corresponds to one dimension. 

    *   Gray codes are used to minimize the errors in digital-to-analog signals conversion (for example, in sensors). 

    *   Gray code can be used to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem.
        Let $n$ denote number of disks. Start with Gray code of length $n$ which
        consists of all zeroes ($G(0)$) and move between consecutive Gray codes (from $G(i)$ to $G(i+1)$).
        Let $i$-th bit of current Gray code represent $n$-th disk 
        (the least significant bit corresponds to the smallest disk and the most significant bit to the biggest disk). 
        Since exactly one bit changes on each step, we can treat changing $i$-th bit as moving $i$-th disk.
        Notice that there is exactly one move option for each disk (except the smallest one) on each step (except start and finish positions).
        There are always two move options for the smallest disk but there is a strategy which will always lead to answer:
        if $n$ is odd then sequence of the smallest disk moves looks like $f \to t \to r \to f \to t \to r \to ...$
        where $f$ is the initial rod, $t$ is the terminal rod and $r$ is the remaining rod), and 
        if $n$ is even: $f \to r \to t \to f \to r \to t \to ...$.

    *   Gray codes are also used in genetic algorithms theory.

INFO - raw_msg:
 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes an integer as input and toggles (flips) all the bits of that integer except for the first and last bits. The first bit is the most significant bit (leftmost), and the last bit is the least significant bit (rightmost).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can convert the integer to its binary representation. We will then identify the first and last bits and toggle all the bits in between. Finally, we will convert the modified binary representation back to an integer and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function toggle_middle_bits(n):
       if n is less than 4:
           return n  # No middle bits to toggle
       convert n to binary string
       keep the first and last bits unchanged
       toggle all bits in between
       convert the modified binary string back to an integer
       return the new integer
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def toggle_middle_bits(n: int) -> int:
    # If the number is less than 4, return it as is (no middle bits to toggle)
    if n < 4:
        return n
    
    # Convert the number to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Get the first and last bits
    first_bit = binary_str[0]
    last_bit = binary_str[-1]
    
    # Toggle the middle bits
    middle_bits = ''.join('1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in binary_str[1:-1])
    
    # Construct the new binary string
    new_binary_str = first_bit + middle_bits + last_bit
    
    # Convert the new binary string back to an integer
    return int(new_binary_str, 2)

# The function is declared last as per the instructions.
