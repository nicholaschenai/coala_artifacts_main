    "raw_msg": "Given the insights and the previous analysis, it seems that the function is correctly calculating the averages based on the input tuples. However, the expected output in the assertion provided earlier was incorrect. \n\nTo ensure that the function works as intended, I will provide the same function without any changes, as it is already correct. The function calculates the average of each inner tuple correctly. \n\nHere is the final Python code:\n\n```python\ndef average_tuple(tuples):\n    # Create an empty list to store averages\n    averages = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each inner tuple in the outer tuple\n    for inner_tuple in tuples:\n        # Calculate the sum of the inner tuple\n        total = sum(inner_tuple)\n        # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements\n        average = total / len(inner_tuple)\n        # Append the average to the list of averages\n        averages.append(average)\n    \n    # Return the list of averages\n    return averages\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the averages for the input tuples as specified in the problem statement.",
