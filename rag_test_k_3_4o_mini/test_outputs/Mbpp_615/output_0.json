    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numbers. The function should calculate the average of the numbers in each inner tuple and return these averages as a list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Iterate through each inner tuple in the outer tuple.\n   - For each inner tuple, calculate the sum of its elements and divide by the number of elements to get the average.\n   - Store each average in a list and return that list at the end.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function average_tuple(tuples):\n       create an empty list to store averages\n       for each inner tuple in tuples:\n           calculate the sum of the inner tuple\n           calculate the average by dividing the sum by the length of the inner tuple\n           append the average to the list of averages\n       return the list of averages\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef average_tuple(tuples):\n    # Create an empty list to store averages\n    averages = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each inner tuple in the outer tuple\n    for inner_tuple in tuples:\n        # Calculate the sum of the inner tuple\n        total = sum(inner_tuple)\n        # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements\n        average = total / len(inner_tuple)\n        # Append the average to the list of averages\n        averages.append(average)\n    \n    # Return the list of averages\n    return averages\n```",
