    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   The task is to create a Python function that takes a list of lists (sublists) and returns the sublist that has the smallest length. If there are multiple sublists with the same minimum length, the function should return the first one encountered.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each sublist in the main list, check its length, and keep track of the shortest sublist found so far. We will initialize a variable to hold the minimum length and the corresponding sublist. As we go through each sublist, we will update our variables whenever we find a shorter sublist.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function Find_Min(sublist):\n       Initialize min_length to infinity\n       Initialize min_sublist to None\n       \n       for each sub in sublist:\n           if length of sub < min_length:\n               min_length = length of sub\n               min_sublist = sub\n       \n       return min_sublist\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef Find_Min(sublist):\n    # Initialize min_length to a large number\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    # Initialize min_sublist to None\n    min_sublist = None\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist\n    for sub in sublist:\n        # Check if the current sublist is shorter than the minimum found so far\n        if len(sub) < min_length:\n            min_length = len(sub)  # Update the minimum length\n            min_sublist = sub      # Update the sublist with the minimum length\n    \n    return min_sublist  # Return the sublist with the minimum length\n```",
