An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and array[i] > array[j]. For example, in the array [1, 20, 6, 4, 5], there are 5 such pairs.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n   To count the inversions efficiently, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm.

out that this is \\emph{not} possible\n    when we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms\n    that are based on comparing array elements.\n\n    The lower bound for the time complexity\n    can be proved by considering sorting\n    as a process where each comparison of two elements\n    gives more information about the contents of the array.\n    The process creates the following tree:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) rectangle (3,1);\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (-2.5,-1.5);\n    \\draw[thick,->]

$x<y$, the process continues to the left,\n    and otherwise to the right.\n    The results of the process are the possible\n    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.\n    For this reason, the height of the tree\n    must be at least\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) = \\log_2(1)+\\log_2(2)+\\cdots+\\log_2(n).\\]\n    We get a lower bound for this sum\n    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and\n    changing the value of each element to $\\log_2(n/2)$.\n    This yields an estimate\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) \\ge (n/2) \\cdot \\log_2(n/2),\\]\n    so the height of the tree and the minimum\n    possible number of steps in a sorting\n    algorithm in the worst case\n    is at least $n \\log n$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Counting sort}\n\n    \\index{counting sort}\n\n    The lower bound $n \\log n$ does not apply to\n    algorithms that do not compare array elements\n    but use some other information.\n    An example of such an algorithm is\n    \\key{counting sort} that sorts an array in\n    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array\n    is an integer between $0 \\ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.\n\n    The algorithm creates a \\emph{bookkeeping} array,\n    whose indices are elements of the original array.\n    The algorithm iterates through the original array\n    and calculates how many times each element\n    appears in the array.\n    \\newpage\n\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at

example, the value at position 3\n    in the bookkeeping array is 2,\n    because the element 3 appears 2 times\n    in the original array.\n\n    Construction of the bookkeeping array\n    takes $O(n)$ time. After this, the sorted array\n    can be created in $O(n)$ time because\n    the number of occurrences of each element can be retrieved\n    from the bookkeeping array.\n    Thus, the total time complexity of counting\n    sort is $O(n)$.\n\n    Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm\n    but it can only be used when the constant $c$\n    is small enough, so that the array elements can\n    be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n    Part: 2/5\n    <div id=\"the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation\"></div>\n    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }\n\n    Consider the following equation:\n\n    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$\n\n    where $0 \\le x_i \\le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\\ldots 6)$.\n\n    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.\n\n    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):\n    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:\n\n    $$N_0 = \\binom{25}{5}$$\n\n    We will now calculate the number of \"bad\" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The \"bad\" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.\n\n    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \\ge 9$, and all other $x_i \\ge 0 ~ (i \\ne k)$ (they may be $\\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:\n\n    $$ | A_k | = \\binom{16}{5} $$\n\n    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \\ne p$) is equal to:\n\n    $$ \\left| A_k \\cap A_p \\right| = \\binom{7}{5}$$\n\n    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.\n\n    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:\n\n    $$\\binom{25}{5} - \\left(\\binom{6}{1} \\cdot \\binom{16}{5} - \\binom{6}{2} \\cdot \\binom{7}{5}\\right) $$\n\n    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval\n\n    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).\n\n    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.\n\n    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\\cdots k)$.\n\n    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:\n\n    $$ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{ r }{ p_i } \\right\\rfloor $$\n\n    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.\n\n    Here is a C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int solve (int n, int r) {\n    \tvector<int> p;\n    \tfor (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)\n    \t\tif (n % i == 0) {\n    \t\t\tp.push_back (i);\n    \t\t\twhile (n % i == 0)\n    \t\t\t\tn /= i;\n    \t\t}\n    \tif (n > 1)\n    \t\tp.push_back (n);\n\n    \tint sum = 0;\n    \tfor (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {\n    \t\tint mult = 1,\n    \t\t\tbits = 0;\n    \t\tfor (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)\n    \t\t\tif (msk & (1<<i)) {\n    \t\t\t\t++bits;\n    \t\t\t\tmult *= p[i];\n    \t\t\t}\n\n    \t\tint cur = r / mult;\n    \t\tif (bits % 2 == 1)\n    \t\t\tsum += cur;\n    \t\telse\n    \t\t\tsum -= cur;\n    \t}\n\n    \treturn r - sum;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Data structures\n    Section: Comparison to sorting\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Comparison to sorting}\n\n    It is often possible to solve a problem\n    using either data structures or sorting.\n    Sometimes there are remarkable differences\n    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,\n    which may be hidden in their time complexities.\n\n    Let us consider a problem where\n    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$\n    that both contain $n$ elements.\n    Our task is to calculate the number of elements\n    that belong to both of the lists.\n    For example, for the lists\n    \\[A = [5,2,8,9] \\hspace{10px} \\textrm{and} \\hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\\]\n    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5\n    and 9 belong to both of the lists.\n\n    A straightforward solution to the problem is\n    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,\n    but next we will focus on\n    more efficient algorithms.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,\n    and after this, we iterate through the elements\n    of $B$ and check for each elements if it\n    also belongs to $A$.\n    This is efficient because the elements of $A$\n    are in a set.\n    Using the \\texttt{set} structure,\n    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,\n    so instead of the \\texttt{set} structure\n    we can also use the \\texttt{unordered\\_set} structure.\n    This is an easy way to make the algorithm\n    more efficient, because we only have to change\n    the underlying data structure.\n    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 3}\n\n    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.\n    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.\n    After this, we iterate through both the lists\n    at the same time and find the common elements.\n    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,\n    so the total time complexity is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    The following table shows how efficient\n    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and\n    the elements of the lists are random\n    integers between $1 \\ldots 10^9$:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\\\\n    $2 \\cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\\\\n    $3 \\cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\\\\n    $4 \\cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\\\\n    $5 \\cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that\n    they use different set structures.\n    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on\n    the running time, because Algorithm 2\n    is 4\u20135 times faster than Algorithm 1.\n\n    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3\n    which uses sorting.\n    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.\n    Interestingly, the time complexity of both\n    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.\n    This can be explained by the fact that\n    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done\n    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.\n    On the other hand,\n    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree\n    during the whole algorithm.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and array[i] > array[j]. For example, in the array [1, 20, 6, 4, 5], there are 5 inversions.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To count inversions efficiently, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The idea is to divide the array into two halves, count the inversions in each half recursively, and then count the inversions that cross the two halves while merging them back together. This approach takes advantage of the fact that when merging two sorted halves, we can count how many elements from the right half are less than elements from the left half, which directly contributes to the inversion count.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n       i = left    // Starting index for left subarray\n       j = mid + 1 // Starting index for right subarray\n       k = left    // Starting index to be sorted\n       inv_count = 0\n\n       while i <= mid and j <= right:\n           if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n               temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n               i += 1\n           else:\n               temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n               inv_count += (mid - i + 1) // Count inversions\n               j += 1\n           k += 1\n\n       while i <= mid:\n           temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n           i += 1\n           k += 1\n\n       while j <= right:\n           temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n           j += 1\n           k += 1\n\n       for i in range(left, right + 1):\n           arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n       return inv_count\n\n   function merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n       inv_count = 0\n       if left < right:\n           mid = (left + right) // 2\n           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n           inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n       return inv_count\n\n   function get_Inv_Count(arr):\n       temp_arr = [0] * len(arr)\n       return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n    i = left    # Starting index for left subarray\n    j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray\n    k = left    # Starting index to be sorted\n    inv_count = 0\n\n    while i <= mid and j <= right:\n        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n            inv_count += (mid - i + 1)  # Count inversions\n            j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    while i <= mid:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[i]\n        i += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    while j <= right:\n        temp_arr[k] = arr[j]\n        j += 1\n        k += 1\n\n    for i in range(left, right + 1):\n        arr[i] = temp_arr[i]\n\n    return inv_count\n\ndef merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n    inv_count = 0\n    if left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)\n        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)\n        inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)\n    return inv_count\n\ndef get_Inv_Count(arr):\n    temp_arr = [0] * len(arr)\n    return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)\n```"
