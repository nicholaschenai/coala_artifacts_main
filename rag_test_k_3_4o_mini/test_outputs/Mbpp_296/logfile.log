INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/296 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that counts the number of inversions in a given array. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and array[i] > array[j]. For example, in the array [1, 20, 6, 4, 5], there are 5 such pairs.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To count the inversions efficiently, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The idea is to divide the array into two halves, count the inversions in each half recursively, and then count the inversions that cross the two halves while merging them back together. This approach will allow us to count inversions in O(n log n) time.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
       i = left    // Starting index for left subarray
       j = mid + 1 // Starting index for right subarray
       k = left    // Starting index to be sorted
       inv_count = 0

       while i <= mid and j <= right:
           if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
               temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
               i += 1
           else:
               temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
               inv_count += (mid - i + 1) // Count inversions
               j += 1
           k += 1

       while i <= mid:
           temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
           i += 1
           k += 1

       while j <= right:
           temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
           j += 1
           k += 1

       for i in range(left, right + 1):
           arr[i] = temp_arr[i]

       return inv_count

   function merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
       inv_count = 0
       if left < right:
           mid = (left + right) // 2
           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)
           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)
           inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)
       return inv_count

   function get_Inv_Count(arr):
       temp_arr = create a temporary array of the same size as arr
       return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, length of arr - 1)
   ```

    The array will be divided into two subarrays
    as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,1);
    \draw (5,0) grid (9,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};

    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Then, the subarrays will be sorted recursively
    as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,1);
    \draw (5,0) grid (9,1);

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Finally, the algorithm merges the sorted
    subarrays and creates the final sorted array:

    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Sorting lower bound}

    Is it possible to sort an array faster
    than in $O(n \log n)$ time?
    It turns out that this is \emph{not} possible
    when we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms
    that are based on comparing array elements.

    The lower bound for the time complexity
    can be proved by considering sorting
    as a process where each comparison of two elements
    gives more information about the contents of the array.
    The process creates the following tree:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) rectangle (3,1);
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (-2.5,-1.5);
    \draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (5.5,-1.5);

    \draw (-4,-2.5) rectangle (-1,-1.5);
    \draw (4,-2.5) rectangle (7,-1.5);
    \node at (-2.5,-2) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (5.5,-2) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-4.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-0.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (3.5,-4);
    \draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (7.5,-4);

    \draw (-6,-5) rectangle (-3,-4);
    \draw (-2,-5) rectangle (1,-4);
    \draw (2,-5) rectangle (5,-4);
    \draw (6,-5) rectangle (9,-4);
    \node at (-4.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (-0.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (3.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (7.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-5.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-4.5,-5) -- (-3.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (0.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (-1.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (2.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (4.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (6.5,-6);
    \draw[thick,->] (7.5,-5) -- (8.5,-6);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Here ''$x<y?$'' means that some elements
    $x$ and $y$ are compared.
    If $x<y$, the process continues to the left,
    and otherwise to the right.
    The results of the process are the possible
    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.
    For this reason, the height of the tree
    must be at least
    \[ \log_2(n!) = \log_2(1)+\log_2(2)+\cdots+\log_2(n).\]
    We get a lower bound for this sum
    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and
    changing the value of each element to $\log_2(n/2)$.
    This yields an estimate
    \[ \log_2(n!) \ge (n/2) \cdot \log_2(n/2),\]
    so the height of the tree and the minimum
    possible number of steps in a sorting
    algorithm in the worst case
    is at least $n \log n$.

    \subsubsection{Counting sort}

    \index{counting sort}

    The lower bound $n \log n$ does not apply to
    algorithms that do not compare array elements
    but use some other information.
    An example of such an algorithm is
    \key{counting sort} that sorts an array in
    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array
    is an integer between $0 \ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.

    The algorithm creates a \emph{bookkeeping} array,
    whose indices are elements of the original array.
    The algorithm iterates through the original array
    and calculates how many times each element
    appears in the array.
    \newpage

    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    corresponds to the following bookkeeping array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (9,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$3$};

    \footnotesize

    \node at (0.5,1.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,1.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,1.5) {$3$};
    \node at (3.5,1.5) {$4$};
    \node at (4.5,1.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,1.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,1.5) {$7$};
    \node at (7.5,1.5) {$8$};
    \node at (8.5,1.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    For example, the value at position 3
    in the bookkeeping array is 2,
    because the element 3 appears 2 times
    in the original array.

    Construction of the bookkeeping array
    takes $O(n)$ time. After this, the sorted array
    can be created in $O(n)$ time because
    the number of occurrences of each element can be retrieved
    from the bookkeeping array.
    Thus, the total time complexity of counting
    sort is $O(n)$.

    Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm
    but it can only be used when the constant $c$
    is small enough, so that the array elements can
    be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    \section{Comparison to sorting}

    It is often possible to solve a problem
    using either data structures or sorting.
    Sometimes there are remarkable differences
    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,
    which may be hidden in their time complexities.

    Let us consider a problem where
    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$
    that both contain $n$ elements.
    Our task is to calculate the number of elements
    that belong to both of the lists.
    For example, for the lists
    \[A = [5,2,8,9] \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\]
    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5
    and 9 belong to both of the lists.

    A straightforward solution to the problem is
    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,
    but next we will focus on
    more efficient algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,
    and after this, we iterate through the elements
    of $B$ and check for each elements if it
    also belongs to $A$.
    This is efficient because the elements of $A$
    are in a set.
    Using the \texttt{set} structure,
    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,
    so instead of the \texttt{set} structure
    we can also use the \texttt{unordered\_set} structure.
    This is an easy way to make the algorithm
    more efficient, because we only have to change
    the underlying data structure.
    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.
    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.
    After this, we iterate through both the lists
    at the same time and find the common elements.
    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n)$,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    so the total time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    The following table shows how efficient
    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and
    the elements of the lists are random
    integers between $1 \ldots 10^9$:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\
    $2 \cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\
    $3 \cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\
    $4 \cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\
    $5 \cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that
    they use different set structures.
    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on
    the running time, because Algorithm 2
    is 4–5 times faster than Algorithm 1.

    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3
    which uses sorting.
    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.
    Interestingly, the time complexity of both
    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \log n)$,
    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.
    This can be explained by the fact that
    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done
    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.
    On the other hand,
    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree
    during the whole algorithm.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/296 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to write a Python function that counts the number of inversions in an array. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and array[i] > array[j]. For example, in the array [1, 20, 6, 4, 5], there are 5 inversions.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To count inversions efficiently, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The idea is to divide the array into two halves, count the inversions in each half recursively, and then count the inversions that cross the two halves while merging them back together. This approach takes advantage of the fact that when merging two sorted halves, we can count how many elements from the right half are less than elements from the left half, which directly contributes to the inversion count.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
       i = left    // Starting index for left subarray
       j = mid + 1 // Starting index for right subarray
       k = left    // Starting index to be sorted
       inv_count = 0

       while i <= mid and j <= right:
           if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
               temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
               i += 1
           else:
               temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
               inv_count += (mid - i + 1) // Count inversions
               j += 1
           k += 1

       while i <= mid:
           temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
           i += 1
           k += 1

       while j <= right:

           j += 1

           arr[i] = temp_arr[i]

       temp_arr = [0] * len(arr)
