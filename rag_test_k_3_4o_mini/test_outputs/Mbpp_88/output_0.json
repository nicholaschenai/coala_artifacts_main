    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a dictionary where each unique integer from the list is a key, and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of integers. For each integer, we will check if it is already a key in our dictionary. If it is, we will increment its value by one. If it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a value of one. This way, we will build a frequency count of all integers in the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function freq_count(lst):\n       create an empty dictionary freq\n       for each number in lst:\n           if number is in freq:\n               increment freq[number] by 1\n           else:\n               set freq[number] to 1\n       return freq\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef freq_count(lst):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store frequency counts\n    freq = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in lst:\n        # If the number is already a key in the dictionary\n        if number in freq:\n            # Increment its count by 1\n            freq[number] += 1\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, add the number to the dictionary with a count of 1\n            freq[number] = 1\n            \n    # Return the dictionary containing the frequency counts\n    return freq\n```",
