Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm\n    Part: 3/4\n    ```\n\n    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\\pi$, and then compute the final answers:\n    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.\n    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.\n\n    Now let us consider the second problem.\n    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:\n    we create the string $s + \\# + t$ and compute its prefix function.\n    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\\pi[i]$ for $i \\ge n + 1$.\n    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.\n\n    ### The number of different substring in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.\n\n    We will solve this problem iteratively.\n    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.\n\n    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.\n    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.\n    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.\n\n    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.\n    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.\n    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ long.\n    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.\n\n    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \\pi_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.\n\n    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.\n\n    ### Compressing a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to find the shortest \"compressed\" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.\n\n    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.\n    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \\pi[n - 1]$.\n    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.\n\n    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.\n    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.\n    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.\n    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.\n    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.\n    And so on.\n    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.\n\n    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.\n    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.\n    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.\n\n    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.\n    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.\n    We prove it by contradiction.\n    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).\n    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.\n    Now consider the second block of the string.\n    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.\n    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.\n    Contradiction.\n\n    $$\\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \\overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$\n\n    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\\pi[7] = 5}$$\n\n    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \\Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$\n\n    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function\n\n    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \\# + t$.\n    Obviously, since $\\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.\n    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \\#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:\n\n    $$\\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \\dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \\#}_{\\text{need to store}} ~ \\underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \\dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\\text{do not need to store}}$$\n\n    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \\in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.\n\n    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.\n\n    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\\text{old}_\\pi, c) \\rightarrow \\text{new}_\\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                int j = i;\n                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])\n                    j = pi[j-1];\n                if ('a' + c == s[j])\n                    j++;\n                aut[i][c] = j;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.\n    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.\n    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0;

This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):\n    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:\n\n    $$N_0 = \\binom{25}{5}$$\n\n    We will now calculate the number of \"bad\" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle.

To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:\n\n    $$ | A_k | = \\binom{16}{5} $$\n\n    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \\ne p$) is equal to:\n\n    $$ \\left| A_k \\cap A_p \\right| = \\binom{7}{5}$$\n\n    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.\n\n    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:\n\n    $$\\binom{25}{5} - \\left(\\binom{6}{1} \\cdot \\binom{16}{5} - \\binom{6}{2} \\cdot \\binom{7}{5}\\right) $$\n\n    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval\n\n    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).\n\n    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.\n\n    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\\cdots k)$.\n\n    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$?

In our case some prime factors may appear multiple times in the prime factorization of $n$.\n\n    If a prime factor $p$ appears $e$ times in the prime factorization of $n$, then we can use the factor $p$ up to $e$ times in the subset.\n    Which means we have $e+1$ choices.\n\n    Therefore if the prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers, then the number of divisors is:\n\n    $$d(n) = (e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$$\n\n    A way of thinking about it is the following:\n\n    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then there are obviously $e_1 + 1$ divisors ($1, p_1, p_1^2, \\dots, p_1^{e_1}$).\n\n    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then you can arrange all divisors in form of a tabular.\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n    & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\\hline\n    1 & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    p_1 & p_1 & p_1 \\cdot p_2 & p_1 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    p_1^2 & p_1^2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\\\\\n    p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2 & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    So the number of divisors is trivially $(e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1)$.\n\n    * A similar argument can be made if there are more then two distinct prime factors.\n\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long numberOfDivisors(long long num) {\n        long long total = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {\n            if (num % i == 0) {\n                int e = 0;\n                do {\n                    e++;\n                    num /= i;\n                } while (num % i == 0);\n                total *= e + 1;\n            }\n        }\n        if (num > 1) {\n            total *= 2;\n        }\n        return total;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Sum of divisors\n\n    We can use the same argument of the previous section.\n\n    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then the sum is:\n\n    $$1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\dots + p_1^{e_1} = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1}$$\n\n    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then we can make the same table as before.\n      The only difference is that now we now want to compute the sum instead of counting the elements.\n      It is easy to see, that the sum of each combination can be expressed as:\n\n    $$\\left(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\dots + p_1^{e_1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\dots + p_2^{e_2}\\right)$$\n\n    $$ = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \\cdot \\frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1}$$\n\n    * In general, for $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ we receive the formula:\n\n    $$\\sigma(n) = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \\cdot \\frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1} \\cdots \\frac{p_k^{e_k + 1} - 1}{p_k - 1}$$\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long SumOfDivisors(long long num) {\n        long long total = 1;\n\n        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {\n            if (num % i == 0) {\n                int e = 0;\n                do {\n                    e++;\n                    num /= i;\n                } while (num % i == 0);\n\n                long long sum = 0, pow = 1;\n                do {\n                    sum += pow;\n                    pow *= i;\n                } while (e-- > 0);\n                total *= sum;\n            }\n        }\n        if (num > 1) {\n            total *= (1 + num);\n        }\n        return total;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Multiplicative functions\n\n    A multiplicative function is a function $f(x)$ which satisfies\n\n    $$f(a \\cdot b) = f(a) \\cdot f(b)$$\n\n    if $a$ and $b$ are coprime.\n\n    Both $d(n)$ and $\\sigma(n)$ are multiplicative functions.\n\n    Multiplicative functions have a huge variety of interesting properties, which can be very useful in number theory problems.\n    For instance the Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is also multiplicative.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

This way, we will build a frequency count of all integers in the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function freq_count(lst):\n       create an empty dictionary freq\n       for each number in lst:\n           if number is in freq:\n               increment freq[number] by 1\n           else:\n               set freq[number] to 1\n       return freq\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef freq_count(lst):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store frequency counts\n    freq = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in lst:\n        # If the number is already a key in the dictionary\n        if number in freq:\n            # Increment its count by 1\n            freq[number] += 1\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, add the number to the dictionary with a count of 1\n            freq[number] = 1\n            \n    # Return the dictionary containing the frequency counts\n    return freq\n```"
