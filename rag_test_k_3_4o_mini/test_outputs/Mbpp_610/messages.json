Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Complete search\n    Section: Generating subsets\n    Part: 1/1\n

techniques, such as greedy algorithms or\n    dynamic programming, may be needed.\n\n    \\section{Generating subsets}\n\n    \\index{subset}\n\n    We first consider the problem of generating\n    all subsets of a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, the subsets of $\\{0,1,2\\}$ are\n    $\\emptyset$, $\\{0\\}$, $\\{1\\}$, $\\{2\\}$, $\\{0,1\\}$,\n    $\\{0,2\\}$, $\\{1,2\\}$ and $\\{0,1,2\\}$.\n    There are two common methods to generate subsets:\n    we can either perform a recursive search\n    or exploit the bit representation of integers.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Method 1}\n\n    An elegant way to go through all subsets\n    of a set is to use recursion.\n    The following function \\texttt{search}\n    generates the subsets of the set\n    $\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\}$.\n    The function maintains a vector \\texttt{subset}\n    that will contain the elements of each subset.\n    The search begins when the function is called\n    with parameter 0.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void search(int k) {\n        if (k == n) {\n            // process subset\n        } else {\n            search(k+1);\n            subset.push_back(k);\n            search(k+1);\n            subset.pop_back();\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    When the function \\texttt{search}\n    is called with parameter $k$,\n    it decides whether to include the\n    element $k$ in the subset or not,\n    and in both cases,\n    then calls itself with parameter $k+1$\n    However, if $k=n$, the function notices that\n    all elements have been processed\n    and a subset has been generated.\n\n    The following tree illustrates the function calls when $n=3$.\n    We can always choose either the left branch\n    ($k$ is not included in the subset) or the right branch\n    ($k$ is included in the subset).\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.45]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\small\n        \\node at (0,0)

representation of integers.\n    Each subset of a set of $n$ elements\n    can be represented as a sequence of $n$ bits,\n    which corresponds to an integer between $0 \\ldots 2^n-1$.\n    The ones in the bit sequence indicate\n    which elements are included in the subset.\n\n    The usual convention is that\n    the last bit corresponds to element 0,\n    the second last bit corresponds to element 1,\n    and so on.\n    For example, the bit representation of 25\n    is 11001, which corresponds to the subset $\\{0,3,4\\}$.\n\n    The following code goes through the subsets\n    of a set of $n$ elements\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int b = 0; b < (1<<n); b++) {\n        // process subset\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The following code shows how we can find\n    the elements of a subset that corresponds to a bit sequence.\n    When processing each subset,\n    the code builds a vector that contains the\n    elements in the subset.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int b = 0; b < (1<<n); b++) {\n        vector<int> subset;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            if (b&(1<<i)) subset.push_back(i);\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Generating all $K$-combinations\n\n    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.\n    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.\n    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.\n\n    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label=\"Generate next lexicographical K-combination\"}\n\n    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.\n    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how\n    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our\n    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once\n    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent\n    elements.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}\n    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {\n        int k = (int)a.size();\n        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {\n                a[i]++;\n                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)\n                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label=\"Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element\"}\n\n    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such\n    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.\n\n    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):\n    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.\n\n    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:\n    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.\n    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the\n    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove\n    a number, add a number).\n\n    Let us prove this:\n\n    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can \n    be obtained as follows:\n\n    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \\cup 1G(N-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the \n    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and\n    concatenate these two sequences.\n\n    Now we may produce our proof.\n\n    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note\n    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As\n    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.\n    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.\n\n    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.\n\n    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.\n\n    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size\n    $K$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}\n    int gray_code (int n) {\n        return n ^ (n >> 1);\n    }\n\n    int count_bits (int n) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (; n; n >>= 1)\n            res += n & 1;\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {\n            int cur = gray_code (i);\n            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (cur & (1 << j))\n                        cout << j + 1;\n                }\n                cout << \"\\n\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus\n    works in $O\\left(N \\cdot \\binom{N}{K}\\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant\n    than the previous solution.\n\n    The implementation is derived from the formula:\n\n    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \\cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the\n    subsequence from appropriate elements.\n\n    Its implementation is as follows:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}\n    vector<int> ans;\n\n    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {\n        if (k > n || k < 0)\n            return;\n\n        if (!n) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {\n                if (ans[i])\n                    cout << i + 1;\n            }\n            cout << \"\\n\";\n            return;\n        }\n\n        ans[idx] = rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);\n        ans[idx] = !rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {\n        ans.resize(n);\n        gen(n, k, 0, false);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The k-th element is determined by the index, which is 0-based. For example, if k is 3, we should remove the element at index 3 from the list.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: The assertion that failed indicates that the expected output after removing the element at index 3 from the list `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]` is `[1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. However, my code returned `[1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. This means that instead of removing the element at index 3 (which is `3`), my code mistakenly removed the element at index 2 (which is `2`).\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The mistake in my code is that I did not account for the fact that the k-th element should be removed based on the input list's index. The logic in the loop is correct, but I need to ensure that the index `k` is correctly interpreted as the position to be removed. \n\n4. **Correcting the Logic**: I need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the k-th element to be removed and that the rest of the elements are added to the result list. The logic for iterating through the list and checking the index should remain the same, but I need to ensure that the index `k` is correctly used to remove the right element.\n\nNow, I will revise the code to ensure it correctly removes the k-th element from the list. \n\nHere\u2019s the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef remove_kth_element(input_list, k):\n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input list\n    for i in range(len(input_list)):\n        # If the current index is not equal to k, add the element to the result\n        if i != k:\n            result.append(input_list[i])\n    \n    # Return the new list with the k'th element removed\n    return result\n``` \n\nThis code should now correctly remove the k-th element from the list."

Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Complete search\n    Section: Generating subsets\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\chapter{Complete search}\n\n    \\key{Complete search}\n    is a general method that can be used\n    to solve almost any algorithm problem.\n    The idea is to generate all possible\n    solutions to the problem using brute force,\n    and then select the best solution or count the\n    number of solutions, depending on the problem.\n\n    Complete search is a good technique\n    if there is

techniques, such as greedy algorithms or\n    dynamic programming, may be needed.\n\n    \\section{Generating subsets}\n\n    \\index{subset}\n\n    We first consider the problem of generating\n    all subsets of a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, the subsets of $\\{0,1,2\\}$ are\n    $\\emptyset$, $\\{0\\}$, $\\{1\\}$, $\\{2\\}$, $\\{0,1\\}$,\n    $\\{0,2\\}$, $\\{1,2\\}$ and $\\{0,1,2\\}$.\n    There are two common methods to generate subsets:\n    we can either perform a recursive search\n    or exploit the bit representation of integers.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Method 1}\n\n    An elegant way to go through all subsets\n    of a set is to use recursion.\n    The following function \\texttt{search}\n    generates the subsets of the set\n    $\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\}$.\n    The function maintains a vector \\texttt{subset}\n    that will contain the elements of each subset.\n    The search begins when the function is called\n    with parameter 0.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void search(int k) {\n        if (k == n) {\n            // process subset\n        } else {\n            search(k+1);\n            subset.push_back(k);\n            search(k+1);\n            subset.pop_back();\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    When the function \\texttt{search}\n    is called with parameter $k$,\n    it decides whether to include the\n    element $k$ in the subset or not,\n    and in both cases,\n    then calls itself with parameter $k+1$\n    However, if $k=n$, the function notices that\n    all elements have been processed\n    and a subset has been generated.\n\n    The following tree illustrates the function calls when $n=3$.\n    We can always choose either the left branch\n    ($k$ is not included in the subset) or the right branch\n    ($k$ is included in the subset).\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.45]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\small\n        \\node at (0,0)

(12,-8-0.5) -- (14,-12+0.5);\n    \\end{scope}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Method 2}\n\n    Another way to generate subsets is based on\n    the bit representation of integers.\n    Each subset of a set of $n$ elements\n    can be represented as a sequence of $n$ bits,\n    which corresponds to an integer between $0 \\ldots 2^n-1$.\n    The ones in the bit sequence indicate\n    which elements are included in the subset.\n\n    The usual convention is that\n    the last bit corresponds to element 0,\n    the second last bit corresponds to element 1,\n    and so on.\n    For example, the bit representation of 25\n    is 11001, which corresponds to the subset $\\{0,3,4\\}$.\n\n    The following code goes through the subsets\n    of a set of $n$ elements\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int b = 0; b < (1<<n); b++) {\n        // process subset\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The following code shows how we can find\n    the

article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.\n    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.\n    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.\n\n    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label=\"Generate next lexicographical K-combination\"}\n\n    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.\n    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how\n    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our\n    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once\n    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent\n    elements.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}\n    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {\n        int k = (int)a.size();\n        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {\n                a[i]++;\n                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)\n                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label=\"Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element\"}\n\n    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such\n    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.\n\n    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):\n    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.\n\n    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:\n    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.\n    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the\n    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove\n    a number, add a number).\n\n    Let us prove this:\n\n    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can \n    be obtained as follows:\n\n    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \\cup 1G(N-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the \n    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and\n    concatenate these two sequences.\n\n    Now we may produce our proof.\n\n    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note\n    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As\n    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.\n    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.\n\n    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.\n\n    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.\n\n    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size\n    $K$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}\n    int gray_code (int n) {\n        return n ^ (n >> 1);\n    }\n\n    int count_bits (int n) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (; n; n >>= 1)\n            res += n & 1;\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {\n            int cur = gray_code (i);\n            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (cur & (1 << j))\n                        cout << j + 1;\n                }\n                cout << \"\\n\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus\n    works in $O\\left(N \\cdot \\binom{N}{K}\\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant\n    than the previous solution.\n\n    The implementation is derived from the formula:\n\n    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \\cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the\n    subsequence from appropriate elements.\n\n    Its implementation is as follows:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}\n    vector<int> ans;\n\n    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {\n        if (k > n || k < 0)\n            return;\n\n        if (!n) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {\n                if (ans[i])\n                    cout << i + 1;\n            }\n            cout << \"\\n\";\n            return;\n        }\n\n        ans[idx] = rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);\n        ans[idx] = !rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {\n        ans.resize(n);\n        gen(n, k, 0, false);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the situation again step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function is supposed to remove the k-th element from the list. The k-th element is determined by the index, which is 0-based. For example, if k is 3, we should remove the element at index 3 from the list.\n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**: The assertion that failed indicates that the expected output after removing the element at index 3 from the list `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]` is `[1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. However, my code returned `[1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. This means that instead of removing the element at index 3 (which is `3`), my code mistakenly removed the element at index 2 (which is `2`).\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**: The mistake in my code is that I did not account for the fact that the k-th element should be removed based on the input list's index. The logic in the loop is correct, but I need to ensure that the index `k` is correctly interpreted as the position to be removed. \n\n4. **Correcting the Logic**: I need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the k-th element to be removed and that the rest of the elements are added to the result list. The logic for iterating through the list and checking the index should remain the same, but I need to ensure that the index `k` is correctly used to remove the right element.\n\nNow, I will revise the code to ensure it correctly removes the k-th element from the list. \n\nHere\u2019s the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef remove_kth_element(input_list, k):\n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input list\n    for i in range(len(input_list)):\n        # If the current index is not equal to k, add the element to the result\n        if i != k:\n            result.append(input_list[i])\n    \n    # Return the new list with the k'th element removed\n    return result\n``` \n\nThis code should now correctly remove the k-th element from the list."

Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Complete search\n    Section: Generating subsets\n    Part: 1/1\n

1}\n\n    An elegant way to go through all subsets\n    of a set is to use recursion.\n    The following function \\texttt{search}\n    generates the subsets of the set\n    $\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\}$.\n    The function maintains a vector \\texttt{subset}\n    that will contain the elements of each subset.\n    The search begins when the function is called\n    with parameter 0.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void search(int k) {\n        if (k == n) {\n            // process subset\n        } else {\n            search(k+1);\n            subset.push_back(k);\n            search(k+1);\n            subset.pop_back();\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    When the function \\texttt{search}\n    is called with parameter $k$,\n    it decides whether to include the\n    element $k$ in the subset or not,\n    and in both cases,\n    then calls itself with parameter $k+1$\n    However, if $k=n$, the function notices that\n    all elements have been processed\n    and a subset has been generated.\n\n    The following tree illustrates the function calls when $n=3$.\n    We can always choose either the left branch\n    ($k$ is not included in the subset) or

article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.\n    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.\n    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.\n\n    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label=\"Generate next lexicographical K-combination\"}\n\n    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.\n    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how\n    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our\n    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once\n    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent\n    elements.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}\n    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {\n        int k = (int)a.size();\n        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {\n                a[i]++;\n                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)\n                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label=\"Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element\"}\n\n    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such\n    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.\n\n    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):\n    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.\n\n    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:\n    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.\n    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the\n    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove\n    a number, add a number).\n\n    Let us prove this:\n\n    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can \n    be obtained as follows:\n\n    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \\cup 1G(N-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the \n    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and\n    concatenate these two sequences.\n\n    Now we may produce our proof.\n\n    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note\n    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As\n    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.\n    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.\n\n    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.\n\n    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.\n\n    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size\n    $K$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}\n    int gray_code (int n) {\n        return n ^ (n >> 1);\n    }\n\n    int count_bits (int n) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (; n; n >>= 1)\n            res += n & 1;\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {\n            int cur = gray_code (i);\n            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (cur & (1 << j))\n                        cout << j + 1;\n                }\n                cout << \"\\n\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus\n    works in $O\\left(N \\cdot \\binom{N}{K}\\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant\n    than the previous solution.\n\n    The implementation is derived from the formula:\n\n    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \\cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the\n    subsequence from appropriate elements.\n\n    Its implementation is as follows:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}\n    vector<int> ans;\n\n    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {\n        if (k > n || k < 0)\n            return;\n\n        if (!n) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {\n                if (ans[i])\n                    cout << i + 1;\n            }\n            cout << \"\\n\";\n            return;\n        }\n\n        ans[idx] = rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);\n        ans[idx] = !rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {\n        ans.resize(n);\n        gen(n, k, 0, false);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The k-th element is determined by the index, which is 0-based.

The logic in the loop is correct, but I need to ensure that the index `k` is correctly interpreted as the position to be removed. \n\n4. **Correcting the Logic**: I need to ensure that the function correctly identifies the k-th element to be removed and that the rest of the elements are added to the result list. The logic for iterating through the list and checking the index should remain the same, but I need to ensure that the index `k` is correctly used to remove the right element.\n\nNow, I will revise the code to ensure it correctly removes the k-th element from the list. \n\nHere\u2019s the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef remove_kth_element(input_list, k):\n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input list\n    for i in range(len(input_list)):\n        # If the current index is not equal to k, add the element to the result\n        if i != k:\n            result.append(input_list[i])\n    \n    # Return the new list with the k'th element removed\n    return result\n``` \n\nThis code should now correctly remove the k-th element from the list."

Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Complete search\n    Section: Generating subsets\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\chapter{Complete search}\n\n    \\key{Complete search}\n    is a general method that can be used\n    to solve almost any algorithm problem.\n    The idea is to generate all possible\n    solutions to the problem using brute force,\n    and then select the best solution or count the\n    number of solutions, depending on the problem.\n\n    Complete search is a good technique\n    if there is enough time to go through all the solutions,\n    because the search is usually easy to implement\n    and it always gives the correct answer.\n    If complete search is too slow,\n    other techniques, such as greedy algorithms or\n    dynamic programming, may be needed.\n\n    \\section{Generating subsets}\n\n    \\index{subset}\n\n    We first consider the problem of generating\n    all subsets of a set of $n$ elements.\n    For example, the subsets of $\\{0,1,2\\}$ are\n    $\\emptyset$, $\\{0\\}$, $\\{1\\}$, $\\{2\\}$, $\\{0,1\\}$,\n    $\\{0,2\\}$, $\\{1,2\\}$ and $\\{0,1,2\\}$.\n    There are two common methods to generate subsets:\n    we can either perform a recursive search\n    or exploit the bit representation of integers.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Method 1}\n\n    An elegant way to go through all subsets\n    of a set is to use recursion.\n    The following function \\texttt{search}\n    generates the subsets of the set\n    $\\{0,1,\\ldots,n-1\\}$.\n    The function maintains a vector \\texttt{subset}\n    that will contain the elements of each subset.\n    The search begins when the function is called\n    with parameter 0.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void search(int k) {\n        if (k == n) {\n            // process subset\n        } else {\n            search(k+1);\n            subset.push_back(k);\n            search(k+1);\n            subset.pop_back();\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    When the function \\texttt{search}\n    is called with parameter $k$,\n    it decides whether to include the\n    element $k$ in the subset or not,\n    and in both cases,\n    then calls itself with parameter $k+1$\n    However, if $k=n$, the function notices that\n    all elements have been processed\n    and a subset has been generated.\n\n    The following tree illustrates the function calls when $n=3$.\n    We can always choose either the left branch\n    ($k$ is not included in the subset) or the right branch\n    ($k$ is included in the subset).\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.45]\n      \\begin{scope}\n        \\small\n        \\node at (0,0)

(12,-8-0.5) -- (14,-12+0.5);\n    \\end{scope}\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Method 2}\n\n    Another way to generate subsets is based on\n    the bit representation of integers.\n    Each subset of a set of $n$ elements\n    can be represented as a sequence of $n$ bits,\n    which corresponds to an integer between $0 \\ldots 2^n-1$.\n    The ones in the bit sequence indicate\n    which elements are included in the subset.\n\n    The usual convention is that\n    the last bit corresponds to element 0,\n    the second last bit corresponds to element 1,\n    and so on.\n    For example, the bit representation of 25\n    is 11001, which corresponds to the subset $\\{0,3,4\\}$.\n\n    The following code goes through the subsets\n    of a set of $n$ elements\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int b = 0; b < (1<<n); b++) {\n        // process subset\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The following code shows how we can find\n    the elements of a subset that corresponds to a bit sequence.\n    When processing each subset,\n    the code builds a vector that contains the\n    elements in the subset.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    for (int b = 0; b < (1<<n); b++) {\n        vector<int> subset;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            if (b&(1<<i)) subset.push_back(i);\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Generating all $K$-combinations\n\n    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.\n    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.\n    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.\n\n    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label=\"Generate next lexicographical K-combination\"}\n\n    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.\n    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how\n    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our\n    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once\n    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent\n    elements.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}\n    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {\n        int k = (int)a.size();\n        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {\n                a[i]++;\n                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)\n                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label=\"Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element\"}\n\n    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such\n    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.\n\n    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):\n    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.\n\n    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:\n    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.\n    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the\n    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove\n    a number, add a number).\n\n    Let us prove this:\n\n    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can \n    be obtained as follows:\n\n    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \\cup 1G(N-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the \n    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and\n    concatenate these two sequences.\n\n    Now we may produce our proof.\n\n    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note\n    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As\n    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.\n    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.\n\n    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.\n\n    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.\n\n    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size\n    $K$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}\n    int gray_code (int n) {\n        return n ^ (n >> 1);\n    }\n\n    int count_bits (int n) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (; n; n >>= 1)\n            res += n & 1;\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {\n        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {\n            int cur = gray_code (i);\n            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {\n                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                    if (cur & (1 << j))\n                        cout << j + 1;\n                }\n                cout << \"\\n\";\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus\n    works in $O\\left(N \\cdot \\binom{N}{K}\\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant\n    than the previous solution.\n\n    The implementation is derived from the formula:\n\n    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \\cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\\text{R}$$\n\n    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the\n    subsequence from appropriate elements.\n\n    Its implementation is as follows:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}\n    vector<int> ans;\n\n    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {\n        if (k > n || k < 0)\n            return;\n\n        if (!n) {\n            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {\n                if (ans[i])\n                    cout << i + 1;\n            }\n            cout << \"\\n\";\n            return;\n        }\n\n        ans[idx] = rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);\n        ans[idx] = !rev;\n        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);\n    }\n\n    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {\n        ans.resize(n);\n        gen(n, k, 0, false);\n    }\n    ```\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
