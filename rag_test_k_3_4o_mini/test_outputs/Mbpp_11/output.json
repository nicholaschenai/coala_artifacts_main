    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string. For example, if the string is \"hello\" and the character is \"l\", the result should be \"heo\".\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   - First, we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the specified character in the string.\n   - Next, we need to find the index of the last occurrence of the same character.\n   - If both indices are found and they are different, we can construct a new string that excludes the characters at these indices.\n   - If the character does not occur or occurs only once, we return the string unchanged.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_Occ(string s, char c):\n       find first_index of c in s\n       find last_index of c in s\n       if first_index is not -1 and last_index is not -1:\n           if first_index is not equal to last_index:\n               return s without characters at first_index and last_index\n       return s\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(s: str, c: str) -> str:\n    # Find the first occurrence of the character\n    first_index = s.find(c)\n    # Find the last occurrence of the character\n    last_index = s.rfind(c)\n    \n    # Check if both occurrences are found and are different\n    if first_index != -1 and last_index != -1 and first_index != last_index:\n        # Create a new string without the first and last occurrence\n        return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]\n    \n    # Return the original string if conditions are not met\n    return s\n```",
