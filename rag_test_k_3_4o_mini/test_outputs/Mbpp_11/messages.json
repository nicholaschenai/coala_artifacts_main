Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm\n    Part: 3/4\n    ```\n\n    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\\pi$, and then compute the final answers:\n    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.\n    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.\n\n    Now let us consider the second problem.\n    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:\n    we create the string $s + \\# + t$ and compute its prefix function.\n    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\\pi[i]$ for $i \\ge n + 1$.\n    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.\n\n    ### The number of different substring in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.\n\n    We will solve this problem iteratively.\n    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.\n\n    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.\n    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.\n    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.\n\n    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.\n    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.\n    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ long.\n    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.\n\n    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \\pi_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.\n\n    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.\n\n    ### Compressing a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to find the shortest \"compressed\" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.\n\n    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.\n    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \\pi[n - 1]$.\n    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.\n\n    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.\n    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.\n    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.\n    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.\n    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.\n    And so on.\n    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.\n\n    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.\n    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.\n    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.\n\n    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.\n    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.\n    We prove it by contradiction.\n    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).\n    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.\n    Now consider the second block of the string.\n    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.\n    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.\n    Contradiction.\n\n    $$\\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \\overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$\n\n    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\\pi[7] = 5}$$\n\n    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \\Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$\n\n    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function\n\n    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \\# + t$.\n    Obviously, since $\\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.\n    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \\#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:\n\n    $$\\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \\dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \\#}_{\\text{need to store}} ~ \\underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \\dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\\text{do not need to store}}$$\n\n    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \\in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.\n\n    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.\n\n    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\\text{old}_\\pi, c) \\rightarrow \\text{new}_\\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                int j = i;\n                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])\n                    j = pi[j-1];\n                if ('a' + c == s[j])\n                    j++;\n                aut[i][c] = j;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.\n    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.\n    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0;

I. Levenshtein who studied it in connection with binary codes \\cite{lev66}.}\n    is the minimum number of editing operations\n    needed to transform a string\n    into another string.\n    The allowed editing operations are as follows:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item insert a character (e.g. \\texttt{ABC} $\\rightarrow$ \\texttt{ABCA})\n    \\item remove a character (e.g. \\texttt{ABC} $\\rightarrow$ \\texttt{AC})\n    \\item modify a character (e.g. \\texttt{ABC} $\\rightarrow$ \\texttt{ADC})\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    For example, the edit distance between\n    \\texttt{LOVE} and \\texttt{MOVIE} is 2,\n    because we can first perform the operation\n     \\texttt{LOVE} $\\rightarrow$ \\texttt{MOVE}\n    (modify) and then the operation\n    \\texttt{MOVE} $\\rightarrow$ \\texttt{MOVIE}\n    (insert).\n    This is the smallest possible number of operations,\n    because it is clear that only one operation is not enough.\n\n    Suppose that we are given a string \\texttt{x}\n    of length $n$ and a string \\texttt{y} of length $m$,\n    and we want to calculate the edit distance between\n    \\texttt{x} and \\texttt{y}.\n    To solve the problem, we define a function\n    $\\texttt{distance}(a,b)$ that gives the\n    edit distance between prefixes\n    $\\texttt{x}[0 \\ldots a]$ and $\\texttt{y}[0 \\ldots b]$.\n    Thus, using this function, the edit distance\n    between \\texttt{x} and \\texttt{y} equals $\\texttt{distance}(n-1,m-1)$.\n\n    We can calculate values of \\texttt{distance}\n    as follows:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\texttt{distance}(a,b) = \\min(& \\texttt{distance}(a,b-1)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{distance}(a-1,b)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{distance}(a-1,b-1)+\\texttt{cost}(a,b)).\n    \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    Here $\\texttt{cost}(a,b)=0$ if $\\texttt{x}[a]=\\texttt{y}[b]$,\n    and otherwise $\\texttt{cost}(a,b)=1$.\n    The formula considers the following ways to\n    edit the string \\texttt{x}:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\texttt{distance}(a,b-1)$: insert a character at the end of \\texttt{x}\n    \\item $\\texttt{distance}(a-1,b)$: remove the last character from \\texttt{x}\n    \\item $\\texttt{distance}(a-1,b-1)$: match or modify the last character of \\texttt{x}\n    \\end{itemize}\n    In the two first cases, one editing operation is needed\n    (insert or remove).\n    In the last case, if $\\texttt{x}[a]=\\texttt{y}[b]$,\n    we can match the last characters without editing,\n    and otherwise one editing operation is needed (modify).\n\n    The following table shows the values of \\texttt{distance}\n    in the example case:\n    \\begin{center}\n

A string of length $n$ has $n(n+1)/2$ substrings.\n    For example, the substrings of\n    \\texttt{ABCD} are\n    \\texttt{A}, \\texttt{B}, \\texttt{C}, \\texttt{D},\n    \\texttt{AB}, \\texttt{BC}, \\texttt{CD},\n    \\texttt{ABC}, \\texttt{BCD} and \\texttt{ABCD}.\n\n    \\index{subsequence}\n\n    A \\key{subsequence} is a sequence of\n    (not necessarily consecutive) characters\n    in a string in their original order.\n    A string of length $n$ has $2^n-1$ subsequences.\n    For example, the subsequences of\n    \\texttt{ABCD} are\n    \\texttt{A}, \\texttt{B}, \\texttt{C}, \\texttt{D},\n    \\texttt{AB}, \\texttt{AC}, \\texttt{AD},\n    \\texttt{BC}, \\texttt{BD}, \\texttt{CD},\n    \\texttt{ABC}, \\texttt{ABD}, \\texttt{ACD},\n    \\texttt{BCD} and \\texttt{ABCD}.\n\n    \\index{prefix}\n    \\index{suffix}\n\n    A \\key{prefix} is a substring that starts at the beginning\n    of a string,\n    and a \\key{suffix} is a substring that ends at the end\n    of a string.\n    For example,\n    the prefixes of \\texttt{ABCD} are\n    \\texttt{A}, \\texttt{AB}, \\texttt{ABC} and \\texttt{ABCD},\n    and the suffixes of \\texttt{ABCD} are\n    \\texttt{D}, \\texttt{CD}, \\texttt{BCD} and \\texttt{ABCD}.\n\n    \\index{rotation}\n\n    A \\key{rotation} can be generated by moving\n    the characters of a string one by one from the beginning\n    to the end (or vice versa).\n    For example, the rotations of \\texttt{ABCD} are\n    \\texttt{ABCD}, \\texttt{BCDA}, \\texttt{CDAB} and \\texttt{DABC}.\n\n    \\index{period}\n\n    A \\key{period} is a prefix of a string such that\n    the string can be constructed by repeating the period.\n    The last repetition may be partial and contain\n    only a prefix of the period.\n    For example, the shortest period of\n    \\texttt{ABCABCA} is \\texttt{ABC}.\n\n    \\index{border}\n\n    A \\key{border} is a string that is both\n    a prefix and a suffix of a string.\n    For example, the borders of \\texttt{ABACABA}\n    are \\texttt{A}, \\texttt{ABA} and \\texttt{ABACABA}.\n\n    \\index{lexicographical order}\n\n    Strings are compared using the \\key{lexicographical order}\n    (which corresponds to the alphabetical order).\n    It means that $x<y$ if either $x \\neq y$ and $x$ is a prefix of $y$,\n    or there is a position $k$ such that\n    $x[i]=y[i]$ when $i<k$ and $x[k]<y[k]$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

For example, if the string is \"hello\" and the character is \"l\", the result should be \"heo\".\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   - First, we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the specified character in the string.\n   - Next, we need to find the index of the last occurrence of the same character.\n   - If both indices are found and they are different, we can construct a new string that excludes the characters at these indices.\n   - If the character does not occur or occurs only once, we return the string unchanged.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function remove_Occ(string s, char c):\n       find first_index of c in s\n       find last_index of c in s\n       if first_index is not -1 and last_index is not -1:\n           if first_index is not equal to last_index:\n               return s without characters at first_index and last_index\n       return s\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(s: str, c: str) -> str:\n    # Find the first occurrence of the character\n    first_index = s.find(c)\n    # Find the last occurrence of the character\n    last_index = s.rfind(c)\n    \n    # Check if both occurrences are found and are different\n    if first_index != -1 and last_index != -1 and first_index != last_index:\n        # Create a new string without the first and last occurrence\n        return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]\n    \n    # Return the original string if conditions are not met\n    return s\n```"
