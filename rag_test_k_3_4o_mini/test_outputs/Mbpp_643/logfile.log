## Instructions

Reason through the problem and:
1. Restate the problem in plain English
2. Conceptualize a solution first in plain English
3. Write a pseudocode solution
4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.

Make sure to wrap your code in '```python' and '```' Markdown delimiters, 
and include exactly one block of code with the entire solution.

No outside libraries are allowed.
Builtins are allowed.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/643 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z', but only if it is not located at the very beginning or the very end of the string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can check the string for the presence of 'z' starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character. If 'z' is found in this range, we will return `True`. If 'z' is not found or is located at the start or end of the string, we will return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `text_match_wordz_middle` that takes a string as input.
   - Check if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, return `False` (since there can't be a 'z' in the middle).
   - Extract the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character.
   - Check if 'z' is in this substring.
   - Return `True` if 'z' is found, otherwise return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the string is too short to have 'z' in the middle
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Extract the middle part of the string
    middle_substring = s[1:-1]
    
    # Check if 'z' is in the middle substring
    return 'z' in middle_substring
```

    \subsubsection{Using the Z-array}

    It is often a matter of taste whether to use
    string hashing or the Z-algorithm.
    Unlike hashing, the Z-algorithm always works
    and there is no risk for collisions.
    On the other hand, the Z-algorithm is more difficult
    to implement and some problems can only be solved
    using hashing.

    As an example, consider again
    the pattern matching problem,
    where our task is to find the occurrences

    ### Comments on this implementation

    The whole solution is given as a function which returns an array of length $n$ -- the Z-function of $s$.

    Array $z$ is initially filled with zeros. The current rightmost match segment is assumed to be $[0; 0)$ (that is, a deliberately small segment which doesn't contain any $i$).

    Inside the loop for $i = 1 \dots n - 1$ we first determine the initial value $z[i]$ -- it will either remain zero or be computed using the above formula.

    Thereafter, the trivial algorithm attempts to increase the value of $z[i]$ as much as possible.

    In the end, if it's required (that is, if $i + z[i] > r$), we update the rightmost match segment $[l, r)$.

    ## Asymptotic behavior of the algorithm

    We will prove that the above algorithm has a running time that is linear in the length of the string -- thus, it's $O(n)$.

    The proof is very simple.

    We are interested in the nested `while` loop, since everything else is just a bunch of constant operations which sums up to $O(n)$.

    We will show that **each iteration** of the `while` loop will increase the right border $r$ of the match segment.

    To do that, we will consider both branches of the algorithm:

    *   $i \geq r$

        In this case, either the `while` loop won't make any iteration (if $s[0] \ne s[i]$), or it will take a few iterations, starting at position $i$, each time moving one character to the right. After that, the right border $r$ will necessarily be updated.

        So we have found that, when $i \geq r$, each iteration of the `while` loop increases the value of the new $r$ index.

    *   $i < r$

        In this case, we initialize $z[i]$ to a certain value $z_0$ given by the above formula. Let's compare this initial value $z_0$ to the value $r - i$. We will have three cases:

          *   $z_0 < r - i$

              We prove that in this case no iteration of the `while` loop will take place.

              It's easy to prove, for example, by contradiction: if the `while` loop made at least one iteration, it would mean that initial approximation $z[i] = z_0$ was inaccurate (less than the match's actual length). But since $s[l \dots r)$ and $s[0 \dots r-l)$ are the same, this would imply that $z[i-l]$ holds the wrong value (less than it should be).

              Thus, since $z[i-l]$ is correct and it is less than $r - i$, it follows that this value coincides with the required value $z[i]$.

          *   $z_0 = r - i$

              In this case, the `while` loop can make a few iterations, but each of them will lead to an increase in the value of the $r$ index because we will start comparing from $s[r]$, which will climb beyond the $[l, r)$ interval.

          *   $z_0 > r - i$

              This option is impossible, by definition of $z_0$.

    So, we have proved that each iteration of the inner loop make the $r$ pointer advance to the right. Since $r$ can't be more than $n-1$, this means that the inner loop won't make more than $n-1$ iterations.

    As the rest of the algorithm obviously works in $O(n)$, we have proved that the whole algorithm for computing Z-functions runs in linear time.

    ## Applications

    We will now consider some uses of Z-functions for specific tasks.

    These applications will be largely similar to applications of [prefix function](prefix-function.md).

    ### Search the substring

    To avoid confusion, we call $t$ the **string of text**, and $p$ the **pattern**. The problem is: find all occurrences of the pattern $p$ inside the text $t$.

    To solve this problem, we create a new string $s = p + \diamond + t$, that is, we apply string concatenation to $p$ and $t$ but we also put a separator character $\diamond$ in the middle (we'll choose $\diamond$ so that it will certainly not be present anywhere in the strings $p$ or $t$).

    Compute the Z-function for $s$. Then, for any $i$ in the interval $[0; \; \operatorname{length}(t) - 1]$, we will consider the corresponding value $k = z[i + \operatorname{length}(p) + 1]$. If $k$ is equal to $\operatorname{length}(p)$ then we know there is one occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$, otherwise there is no occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$.

    The running time (and memory consumption) is $O(\operatorname{length}(t) + \operatorname{length}(p))$.

    ### Number of distinct substrings in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$, count the number of distinct substrings of $s$.

    We'll solve this problem iteratively. That is: knowing the current number of different substrings, recalculate this amount after adding to the end of $s$ one character.

    So, let $k$ be the current number of distinct substrings of $s$. We append a new character $c$ to $s$. Obviously, there can be some new substrings ending in this new character $c$ (namely, all those strings that end with this symbol and that we haven't encountered yet).

    Take a string $t = s + c$ and invert it (write its characters in reverse order). Our task is now to count how many prefixes of $t$ are not found anywhere else in $t$. Let's compute the Z-function of $t$ and find its maximum value $z_{max}$. Obviously, $t$'s prefix of length $z_{max}$ occurs also somewhere in the middle of $t$. Clearly, shorter prefixes also occur.

    So, we have found that the number of new substrings that appear when symbol $c$ is appended to $s$ is equal to $\operatorname{length}(t) - z_{max}$.

    Consequently, the running time of this solution is $O(n^2)$ for a string of length $n$.

    It's worth noting that in exactly the same way we can recalculate, still in $O(n)$ time, the number of distinct substrings when appending a character in the beginning of the string, as well as when removing it (from the end or the beginning).

    ### String compression

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$. Find its shortest "compressed" representation, that is: find a string $t$ of shortest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    A solution is: compute the Z-function of $s$, loop through all $i$ such that $i$ divides $n$. Stop at the first $i$ such that $i + z[i] = n$. Then, the string $s$ can be compressed to the length $i$.

    The proof for this fact is the same as the solution which uses the [prefix function](prefix-function.md).

    Part: 3/3
    $.
    We already solved this problem efficiently
    using string hashing, but the Z-algorithm
    provides another way to solve the problem.

    A usual idea in string processing is to
    construct a string that consists of
    multiple strings separated by special characters.
    In this problem, we can construct a string
    $p$\texttt{\#}$s$,
    where $p$ and $s$ are separated by a special
    character \texttt{\#} that does not occur
    in the strings.
    The Z-array of $p$\texttt{\#}$s$ tells us the positions
    where $p$ occurs in $s$,
    because such positions contain the length of $p$.

    For example, if $s=$\texttt{HATTIVATTI} and $p=$\texttt{ATT},
    the Z-array is as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (14,2);

    \node at (0.5, 1.5) {A};

    \node at (13.5, 2.5) {13};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The positions 5 and 10 contain the value 3,
    which means that the pattern \texttt{ATT}
    occurs in the corresponding positions
    of \texttt{HATTIVATTI}.

    The time complexity of the resulting algorithm
    is linear, because it suffices to construct
    the Z-array and go through its values.

    \subsubsection{Implementation}

    Here is a short implementation of the Z-algorithm
    that returns a vector that corresponds to the Z-array.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    vector<int> z(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> z(n);
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            z[i] = max(0,min(z[i-x],y-i+1));
            while (i+z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i+z[i]]) {
                x = i; y = i+z[i]; z[i]++;
            }
        }
        return z;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/643 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z' anywhere except at the start or the end of the string. The function should return `True` if 'z' is found in the middle of the string and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: 
   To solve this problem, we can check the string for the presence of 'z' starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character. If 'z' is found in this range, we return `True`. If we reach the end of the string without finding 'z' in the specified range, we return `False`.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:
       if length of s is less than 3:
           return False
       for each character in s from index 1 to length of s - 2:
           if character is 'z':
               return True
       return False
