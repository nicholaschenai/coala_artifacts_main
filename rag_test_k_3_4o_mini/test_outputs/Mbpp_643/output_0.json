    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'z' anywhere except at the start or the end of the string. The function should return `True` if 'z' is found in the middle of the string and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we can check the string for the presence of 'z' starting from the second character and ending at the second-to-last character. If 'z' is found in this range, we return `True`. If we reach the end of the string without finding 'z' in the specified range, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:\n       if length of s is less than 3:\n           return False\n       for each character in s from index 1 to length of s - 2:\n           if character is 'z':\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef text_match_wordz_middle(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is too short to contain 'z' in the middle\n    if len(s) < 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Iterate through the string from the second character to the second-to-last\n    for i in range(1, len(s) - 1):\n        # Check if the current character is 'z'\n        if s[i] == 'z':\n            return True\n    \n    # If no 'z' was found in the middle, return False\n    return False\n```",
