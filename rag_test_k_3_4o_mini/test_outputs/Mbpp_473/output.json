    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes two lists of tuples as input and finds the common tuples between them, regardless of the order of the elements within the tuples. The output should be a set of these common tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each tuple in the first list and check if there is a corresponding tuple in the second list that contains the same elements, regardless of their order. We can achieve this by sorting the elements of each tuple before comparison. If a match is found, we add the tuple to a result set to ensure uniqueness.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function tuple_intersection(list1, list2):\n       create an empty set for result\n       for each tuple in list1:\n           sort the tuple\n           for each tuple in list2:\n               sort the tuple\n               if the sorted tuple from list1 matches the sorted tuple from list2:\n                   add the original tuple from list1 to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef tuple_intersection(list1, list2):\n    # Create an empty set to store the result\n    result = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the first list\n    for tup1 in list1:\n        # Sort the first tuple\n        sorted_tup1 = tuple(sorted(tup1))\n        \n        # Iterate through each tuple in the second list\n        for tup2 in list2:\n            # Sort the second tuple\n            sorted_tup2 = tuple(sorted(tup2))\n            \n            # If the sorted tuples match, add the original tuple from list1 to the result\n            if sorted_tup1 == sorted_tup2:\n                result.add(tup1)\n    \n    # Return the set of intersecting tuples\n    return result\n```",
