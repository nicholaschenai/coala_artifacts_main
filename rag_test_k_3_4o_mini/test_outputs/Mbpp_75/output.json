    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. The function should return a list of those tuples where every element in the tuple is divisible by `k`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each tuple in the list. For each tuple, we will check if all its elements are divisible by `k`. If they are, we will add that tuple to our result list. Finally, we will return the list of tuples that meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_tuples(tuples_list, k):\n       result = empty list\n       for each tuple in tuples_list:\n           if all elements in tuple are divisible by k:\n               add tuple to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_tuples(tuples_list, k):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the provided list\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        # Check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by k\n        if all(element % k == 0 for element in tup):\n            # If true, add the tuple to the result list\n            result.append(tup)\n    \n    # Return the list of tuples that have all elements divisible by k\n    return result\n```",
