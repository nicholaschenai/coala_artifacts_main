    "raw_msg": "Given the previous analysis and the insights from the memories, it seems that the calculation of the surface area of the square pyramid may have a slight oversight in the way the lateral area is being computed. \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Surface Area Calculation**:\n   - The base area is correctly calculated as \\( \\text{base\\_edge}^2 \\).\n   - The lateral area consists of the areas of the four triangular faces, which should be calculated using the correct height of the triangle.\n\n2. **Triangle Height Calculation**:\n   The height of the triangular face is calculated using:\n   \\[\n   \\text{triangle\\_height} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\text{base\\_edge}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\text{height}^2}\n   \\]\n   This part is correct, but we need to ensure that the area of the triangle is calculated accurately.\n\n3. **Area of One Triangle**:\n   The area of one triangular face is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base\\_edge} \\times \\text{triangle\\_height}\n   \\]\n   The total lateral area is then:\n   \\[\n   \\text{lateral\\_area} = 4 \\times \\text{triangle\\_area}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Surface Area Calculation**:\n   The total surface area is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{total\\_surface\\_area} = \\text{base\\_area} + \\text{lateral\\_area}\n   \\]\n   The issue may arise from how the triangle height is being calculated or how the final surface area is being rounded.\n\n### Revised Code:\nTo ensure that the calculations are accurate and to avoid any floating-point inaccuracies, I will explicitly calculate the triangle height and ensure that the final surface area is calculated correctly. Here\u2019s the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef surface_Area(base_edge: int, height: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of the base\n    base_area = base_edge * base_edge\n    \n    # Calculate the height of the triangular face using Pythagorean theorem\n    triangle_height = ((base_edge / 2) ** 2 + height ** 2) ** 0.5\n    \n    # Calculate the area of one triangular face\n    triangle_area = (1 / 2) * base_edge * triangle_height\n    \n    # Total lateral area (4 triangular faces)\n    lateral_area = 4 * triangle_area\n    \n    # Total surface area\n    total_surface_area = base_area + lateral_area\n    \n    # Return the total surface area rounded to the nearest integer\n    return int(total_surface_area)  # Ensure we return as an integer\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly calculate the surface area of the square pyramid and return the expected result.",
