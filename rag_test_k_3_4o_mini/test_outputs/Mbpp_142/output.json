    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many items are the same and in the same position across three different lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the three lists simultaneously, comparing the elements at each index. Each time we find that the elements at the same index in all three lists are identical, we will increment a counter. At the end of the iteration, we will return the counter as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):\n       initialize counter to 0\n       for i from 0 to length of list1:\n           if list1[i] equals list2[i] and list1[i] equals list3[i]:\n               increment counter\n       return counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of identical items\n    counter = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Check if the elements at the same index are identical in all three lists\n        if list1[i] == list2[i] and list1[i] == list3[i]:\n            # Increment the counter if they are identical\n            counter += 1\n            \n    # Return the final count of identical items\n    return counter\n```",
