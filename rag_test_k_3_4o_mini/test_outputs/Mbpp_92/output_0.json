    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that checks if a given number is \"undulating.\" An undulating number is defined as one where the digits alternate between two different values. For example, the number 1212121 is undulating because it alternates between 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if a number is undulating, we can convert the number to a string to easily access each digit. We will then check if the digits alternate between two distinct values. This can be done by iterating through the digits and ensuring that no two adjacent digits are the same and that they alternate between two values.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_undulating(number):\n       convert number to string\n       if length of string is less than 2:\n           return False\n       initialize first_digit as the first character of string\n       initialize second_digit as None\n       for each character in string starting from the second character:\n           if character is equal to first_digit:\n               continue\n           if second_digit is None:\n               set second_digit to character\n           else if character is not equal to second_digit:\n               return False\n           update first_digit and second_digit accordingly\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_undulating(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string to access each digit\n    num_str = str(number)\n    \n    # If the length of the string is less than 2, it cannot be undulating\n    if len(num_str) < 2:\n        return False\n    \n    # Initialize the first digit and a placeholder for the second digit\n    first_digit = num_str[0]\n    second_digit = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the digits starting from the second character\n    for char in num_str[1:]:\n        # If the current character is the same as the first digit, continue\n        if char == first_digit:\n            continue\n        \n        # If second_digit is not set, assign it the current character\n        if second_digit is None:\n            second_digit = char\n        # If the current character is not equal to the second digit, return False\n        elif char != second_digit:\n            return False\n        \n        # Update first_digit and second_digit for the next iteration\n        first_digit, second_digit = second_digit, first_digit\n    \n    # If we successfully checked all characters, return True\n    return True\n```",
