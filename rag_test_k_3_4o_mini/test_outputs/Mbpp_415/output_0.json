    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and finds two numbers in that list whose product is the highest. The function should return these two numbers as a tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the pair of numbers with the highest product, we can iterate through the list of integers and keep track of the two largest numbers we encounter. The product of these two numbers will be the highest product possible from any pair in the list. If the list has fewer than two numbers, we cannot find a pair.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_Product(arr):\n       if length of arr < 2:\n           return None  // or some indication of failure\n       \n       first_max = -infinity\n       second_max = -infinity\n       \n       for each number in arr:\n           if number > first_max:\n               second_max = first_max\n               first_max = number\n           else if number > second_max:\n               second_max = number\n       \n       return (first_max, second_max)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_Product(arr):\n    # Check if the array has fewer than 2 elements\n    if len(arr) < 2:\n        return None  # or some indication of failure\n    \n    # Initialize the two largest numbers\n    first_max = float('-inf')\n    second_max = float('-inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through the array to find the two largest numbers\n    for number in arr:\n        if number > first_max:\n            second_max = first_max  # Update second largest\n            first_max = number  # Update largest\n        elif number > second_max:\n            second_max = number  # Update second largest if current number is less than first_max but greater than second_max\n    \n    # Return the pair with the highest product\n    return (first_max, second_max)\n```",
