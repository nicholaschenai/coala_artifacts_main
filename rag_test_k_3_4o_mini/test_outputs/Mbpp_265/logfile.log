INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/265 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer `n`. The function should split the list into smaller lists, where each smaller list contains elements that are spaced `n` positions apart in the original list. The result should be a list of these smaller lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the original list and collect elements into separate lists based on their index. For every index `i`, we will take the elements at positions `i`, `i+n`, `i+2n`, etc., until we reach the end of the list. We will repeat this for each starting index from `0` to `n-1`, creating a new list for each starting index.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function list_split(input_list, n):
       create an empty list called result
       for i from 0 to n-1:
           create an empty list called temp
           for j from i to length of input_list with step n:
               append input_list[j] to temp
           append temp to result
       return result
   ```

    Chapter: Complete search
    Section: Generating permutations
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Generating permutations}

    \index{permutation}

    Next we consider the problem of generating
    all permutations of a set of $n$ elements.
    For example, the permutations of $\{0,1,2\}$ are
    $(0,1,2)$, $(0,2,1)$, $(1,0,2)$, $(1,2,0)$,
    $(2,0,1)$ and $(2,1,0)$.
    Again, there are two approaches:
    we can either use recursion or go through the
    permutations iteratively.

    \subsubsection{Method 1}

    Like subsets, permutations can be generated
    using recursion.
    The following function \texttt{search} goes
    through the permutations of the set $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$.
    The function builds a vector \texttt{permutation}
    that contains the permutation,
    and the search begins when the function is
    called without parameters.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    void search() {
        if (permutation.size() == n) {
            // process permutation
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (chosen[i]) continue;
                chosen[i] = true;
                permutation.push_back(i);
                search();
                chosen[i] = false;
                permutation.pop_back();
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Each function call adds a new element to
    \texttt{permutation}.
    The array \texttt{chosen} indicates which
    elements are already included in the permutation.
    If the size of \texttt{permutation} equals the size of the set,
    a permutation has been generated.

    \subsubsection{Method 2}

    \index{next\_permutation@\texttt{next\_permutation}}

    Another method for generating permutations
    is to begin with the permutation
    $\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}$ and repeatedly
    use a function that constructs the next permutation
    in increasing order.
    The C++ standard library contains the function
    \texttt{next\_permutation} that can be used for this:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    vector<int> permutation;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        permutation.push_back(i);
    }
    do {
        // process permutation
    } while (next_permutation(permutation.begin(),permutation.end()));
    \end{lstlisting}

    Title: Generating all $K$-combinations
    Part: 1/1
    # Generating all $K$-combinations

    In this article we will discuss the problem of generating all $K$-combinations.
    Given the natural numbers $N$ and $K$, and considering a set of numbers from $1$ to $N$.
    The task is to derive all **subsets of size $K$**.

    ## Generate next lexicographical $K$-combination {data-toc-label="Generate next lexicographical K-combination"}

    First we will generate them in lexicographical order.
    The algorithm for this is simple. The first combination will be ${1, 2, ..., K}$. Now let's see how
    to find the combination that immediately follows this, lexicographically. To do so, we consider our
    current combination, and find the rightmost element that has not yet reached its highest possible value. Once
    finding this element, we increment it by $1$, and assign the lowest valid value to all subsequent
    elements.

    ```{.cpp file=next_combination}
    bool next_combination(vector<int>& a, int n) {
        int k = (int)a.size();
        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (a[i] < n - k + i + 1) {
                a[i]++;
                for (int j = i + 1; j < k; j++)
                    a[j] = a[j - 1] + 1;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    ```

    ## Generate all $K$-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element {data-toc-label="Generate all K-combinations such that adjacent combinations differ by one element"}

    This time we want to generate all $K$-combinations in such
    an order, that adjacent combinations differ exactly by one element.

    This can be solved using the [Gray Code](../algebra/gray-code.md):
    If we assign a bitmask to each subset, then by generating and iterating over these bitmasks with Gray codes, we can obtain our answer.

    The task of generating $K$-combinations can also be solved using Gray Codes in a different way:
    Generate Gray Codes for the numbers from $0$ to $2^N - 1$ and leave only those codes containing $K$ $1$s.
    The surprising fact is that in the resulting sequence of $K$ set bits, any two neighboring masks (including the
    first and last mask - neighboring in a cyclic sense) - will differ exactly by two bits, which is our objective (remove
    a number, add a number).

    Let us prove this:

    For the proof, we recall the fact that the sequence $G(N)$ (representing the $N$<sup>th</sup> Gray Code) can 
    be obtained as follows:

    $$G(N) = 0G(N-1) \cup 1G(N-1)^\text{R}$$

    That is, consider the Gray Code sequence for $N-1$, and prefix $0$ before every term. And consider the 
    reversed Gray Code sequence for $N-1$ and prefix a $1$ before every mask, and
    concatenate these two sequences.

    Now we may produce our proof.

    First, we prove that the first and last masks differ exactly in two bits. To do this, it is sufficient to note
    that the first mask of the sequence $G(N)$, will be of the form $N-K$ $0$s, followed by $K$ $1$s. As
    the first bit is set as $0$, after which $(N-K-1)$ $0$s follow, after which $K$ set bits follow and the last mask will be of the form $1$, then $(N-K)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s.
    Applying the principle of mathematical induction, and using the formula for $G(N)$, concludes the proof.

    Now our task is to show that any two adjacent codes also differ exactly in two bits, we can do this by considering our recursive equation for the generation of Gray Codes. Let us assume the content of the two halves formed by $G(N-1)$ is true. Now we need to prove that the new consecutive pair formed at the junction (by the concatenation of these two halves) is also valid, i.e. they differ by exactly two bits.

    This can be done, as we know the last mask of the first half and the first mask of the second half. The last mask of the first half would be $1$, then $(N-K-1)$ $0$s, then $K-1$ $1$s. And the first mask of the second half would be $0$, then $(N-K-2)$ $0$s would follow, and then $K$ $1$s. Thus, comparing the two masks, we find exactly two bits that differ.

    The following is a naive implementation working by generating all $2^{n}$ possible subsets, and finding subsets of size
    $K$.

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_naive}
    int gray_code (int n) {
        return n ^ (n >> 1);
    }

    int count_bits (int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for (; n; n >>= 1)
            res += n & 1;
        return res;
    }

    void all_combinations (int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            int cur = gray_code (i);
            if (count_bits(cur) == k) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (cur & (1 << j))
                        cout << j + 1;
                }
                cout << "\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    It's worth mentioning that a more efficient implementation exists that only resorts to building valid combinations and thus
    works in $O\left(N \cdot \binom{N}{K}\right)$ however it is recursive in nature and for smaller values of $N$ it probably has a larger constant
    than the previous solution.

    The implementation is derived from the formula:

    $$G(N, K) = 0G(N-1, K) \cup 1G(N-1, K-1)^\text{R}$$

    This formula is obtained by modifying the general equation to determine the Gray code, and works by selecting the
    subsequence from appropriate elements.

    Its implementation is as follows:

    ```{.cpp file=generate_all_combinations_fast}
    vector<int> ans;

    void gen(int n, int k, int idx, bool rev) {
        if (k > n || k < 0)
            return;

        if (!n) {
            for (int i = 0; i < idx; ++i) {
                if (ans[i])
                    cout << i + 1;
            }
            cout << "\n";
            return;
        }

        ans[idx] = rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - rev, idx + 1, false);
        ans[idx] = !rev;
        gen(n - 1, k - !rev, idx + 1, true);
    }

    void all_combinations(int n, int k) {
        ans.resize(n);
        gen(n, k, 0, false);
    }
    ```
