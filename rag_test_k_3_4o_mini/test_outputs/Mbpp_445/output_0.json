    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   The task is to create a function that takes two tuples, each containing pairs of numbers. The function should multiply the corresponding elements of these pairs index-wise and return a new tuple with the results.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through both tuples simultaneously. For each index, we will multiply the first element of the first tuple with the first element of the second tuple, and the second element of the first tuple with the second element of the second tuple. We will store these products in a new tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):\n       create an empty list to store results\n       for each index i from 0 to length of tuple1:\n           multiply tuple1[i][0] with tuple2[i][0] and store in results\n           multiply tuple1[i][1] with tuple2[i][1] and store in results\n       convert results list to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef index_multiplication(t1, t2):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through both tuples simultaneously\n    for i in range(len(t1)):\n        # Multiply the first elements of the pairs and append to result\n        first_product = t1[i][0] * t2[i][0]\n        # Multiply the second elements of the pairs and append to result\n        second_product = t1[i][1] * t2[i][1]\n        # Append the products as a tuple to the result list\n        result.append((first_product, second_product))\n    \n    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```",
