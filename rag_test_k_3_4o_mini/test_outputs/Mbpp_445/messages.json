Let $\\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \\dots]$, find $\\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_k]$ for $0 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$.\n    ??? hint \"Solution\"\n        After computing the period of $\\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\\lfloor \\frac{k-1}{T}\\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.\n\n        === \"Python\"\n            ```py\n            x, k = map(int, input().split())\n\n            mod = 10**9+7\n        \n            # compose (A[0]*x + A[1]) / (A[2]*x + A[3]) and (B[0]*x + B[1]) / (B[2]*x + B[3])\n            def combine(A, B):\n                return [t % mod for t in [A[0]*B[0]+A[1]*B[2], A[0]*B[1]+A[1]*B[3], A[2]*B[0]+A[3]*B[2], A[2]*B[1]+A[3]*B[3]]]\n\n            A = [1, 0, 0, 1] # (x + 0) / (0*x + 1) = x\n\n            a = sqrt(x)\n\n            T = len(a) - 1 # period of a\n\n            # apply ak + 1/x = (ak*x+1)/(1x+0) to (Ax + B) / (Cx + D)\n            for i in reversed(range(1, len(a))):\n                A = combine([a[i], 1, 1, 0], A)\n\n            def bpow(A, n):\n                return [1, 0, 0, 1] if not n else combine(A, bpow(A, n-1)) if n % 2 else bpow(combine(A, A), n // 2)\n\n\n            C = (0, 1, 0, 0) # = 1 / 0\n            while k % T:\n                i = k % T\n                C = combine([a[i], 1, 1, 0], C)\n                k -= 1\n\n            C = combine(bpow(A, k // T), C)\n            C = combine([a[0], 1, 1, 0], C)\n            print(str(C[1]) + '/' + str(C[3]))\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Basic Geometry\n    Part: 3/3\n    ```\n\n    ### Properties\n\n    As for the cross product, it equals to the zero vector iff the vectors $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$ are collinear (they form a common line, i.e. they are parallel).\n    The same thing holds for the triple product, it is equal to zero iff the vectors $\\mathbf a$, $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ are coplanar (they form a common plane).\n\n    From this we can obtain universal equations defining lines and planes.\n    A line can be defined via its direction vector $\\mathbf d$ and an initial point $\\mathbf r_0$ or by two points $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$.\n    It is defined as $(\\mathbf r - \\mathbf r_0)\\times\\mathbf d=0$ or as $(\\mathbf r - \\mathbf a)\\times (\\mathbf b - \\mathbf a) = 0$.\n    As for planes, it can be defined by three points $\\mathbf a$, $\\mathbf b$ and $\\mathbf c$ as $(\\mathbf r - \\mathbf a)\\cdot((\\mathbf b - \\mathbf a)\\times (\\mathbf c - \\mathbf a))=0$ or by initial point $\\mathbf r_0$ and two direction vectors lying in this plane $\\mathbf d_1$ and $\\mathbf d_2$: $(\\mathbf r - \\mathbf r_0)\\cdot(\\mathbf d_1\\times \\mathbf d_2)=0$.\n\n    In 2D the pseudo-scalar product also may be used to check the orientation between two vectors because it is positive if the rotation from the first to the second vector is clockwise and negative otherwise.\n    And, of course, it can be used to calculate areas of polygons, which is described in a different article.\n    A triple product can be used for the same purpose in 3D space.\n\n    ## Exercises\n\n    ### Line intersection\n\n    There are many possible ways to define a line in 2D and you shouldn't hesitate to combine them.\n    For example we have two lines and we want to find their intersection points.\n    We can say that all points from first line can be parameterized as $\\mathbf r = \\mathbf a_1 + t \\cdot \\mathbf d_1$ where $\\mathbf a_1$ is initial point, $\\mathbf d_1$ is direction and $t$ is some real parameter.\n    As for second line all its points must satisfy $(\\mathbf r - \\mathbf a_2)\\times \\mathbf d_2=0$. From this we can easily find parameter $t$:\n\n    $$(\\mathbf a_1 + t \\cdot \\mathbf d_1 - \\mathbf a_2)\\times \\mathbf d_2=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad t = \\dfrac{(\\mathbf a_2 - \\mathbf a_1)\\times\\mathbf d_2}{\\mathbf d_1\\times \\mathbf d_2}$$\n\n    Let's implement function to intersect two lines.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=basic_line_intersection}\n    point2d intersect(point2d a1, point2d d1, point2d a2, point2d d2) {\n        return a1 + cross(a2 - a1, d2) / cross(d1, d2) * d1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Planes intersection\n\n    However sometimes it might be hard to use some geometric insights.\n    For example, you're given three planes defined by initial points $\\mathbf a_i$ and directions $\\mathbf d_i$ and you want to find their intersection point.\n    You may note that you just have to solve the system of equations:\n\n    $$\\begin{cases}\\mathbf r\\cdot \\mathbf n_1 = \\mathbf a_1\\cdot \\mathbf n_1, \\\\ \\mathbf r\\cdot \\mathbf n_2 = \\mathbf a_2\\cdot \\mathbf n_2, \\\\ \\mathbf r\\cdot \\mathbf n_3 = \\mathbf a_3\\cdot \\mathbf n_3\\end{cases}$$\n\n    Instead of thinking on geometric approach, you can work out an algebraic one which can be obtained immediately.\n    For example, given that you already implemented a point class, it will be easy for you to solve this system using Cramer's rule because the triple product is simply the determinant of the matrix obtained from the vectors being its columns:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=plane_intersection}\n    point3d intersect(point3d a1, point3d n1, point3d a2, point3d n2, point3d a3, point3d n3) {\n        point3d x(n1.x, n2.x, n3.x);\n        point3d y(n1.y, n2.y, n3.y);\n        point3d z(n1.z, n2.z, n3.z); \n        point3d d(dot(a1, n1), dot(a2, n2), dot(a3, n3));\n        return point3d(triple(d, y, z),\n                       triple(x, d, z),\n                       triple(x, y, d)) / triple(n1, n2, n3);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now you may try to find out approaches for common geometric operations yourself to get used to all this stuff.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
