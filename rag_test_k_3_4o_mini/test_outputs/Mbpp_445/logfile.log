INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/445 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two tuples, each containing pairs of numbers. The function should multiply the corresponding elements of these tuples index-wise and return a new tuple with the results.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements at the same index in the two tuples, we will multiply them together.
   - We will collect these products into a new tuple.
   - Finally, we will return this new tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):
       Initialize an empty list to store the results
       For each index i from 0 to the length of tuple1:
           Multiply the elements tuple1[i] and tuple2[i]
           Append the result to the results list
       Convert the results list to a tuple
       Return the results tuple
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through both tuples using their indices
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):

    \chapter{Matrices}

    \index{matrix}

    A \key{matrix} is a mathematical concept
    that corresponds to a two-dimensional array
    in programming. For example,
    \[
    A = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 13 & 7 & 4 \\
      7 & 0 & 8 & 2 \\
      9 & 5 & 4 & 18 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]
    is a matrix of size $3 \times 4$, i.e.,
    it has 3 rows and 4 columns.
    The notation $[i,j]$ refers to
    the element in row $i$ and column $j$
    in a matrix.
    For example, in the above matrix,
    $A[2,3]=8$ and $A[3,1]=9$.

    \index{vector}

    A special case of a matrix is a \key{vector}
    that is a one-dimensional matrix of size $n \times 1$.
    For example,
    \[
    V =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    4 \\
    7 \\
    5 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
    is a vector that contains three elements.

    \index{transpose}

    The \key{transpose} $A^T$ of a matrix $A$
    is obtained when the rows and columns of $A$
    are swapped, i.e., $A^T[i,j]=A[j,i]$:
    \[
    A^T = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 7 & 9 \\
      13 & 0 & 5 \\
      7 & 8 & 4 \\
      4 & 2 & 18 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]

    \index{square matrix}

    A matrix is a \key{square matrix} if it
    has the same number of rows and columns.
    For example, the following matrix is a
    square matrix:

    \[
    S = 
     \begin{bmatrix}
      3 & 12 & 4  \\
      5 & 9 & 15  \\
      0 & 2 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]

    \section{Operations}

    The sum $A+B$ of matrices $A$ and $B$
    is defined if the matrices are of the same size.
    The result is a matrix where each element
    is the sum of the corresponding elements
    in $A$ and $B$.

    For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 & 2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    +
     \begin{bmatrix}
      4 & 9 & 3 \\
      8 & 1 & 3 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      6+4 & 1+9 & 4+3 \\
      3+8 & 9+1 & 2+3 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      10 & 10 & 7 \\
      11 & 10 & 5 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    Multiplying a matrix $A$ by a value $x$ means
    that each element of $A$ is multiplied by $x$.
    For example,
    \[
     2 \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
      6 & 1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 & 2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 \cdot 6 & 2\cdot1 & 2\cdot4 \\
      2\cdot3 & 2\cdot9 & 2\cdot2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      12 & 2 & 8 \\
      6 & 18 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    \subsubsection{Matrix multiplication}

    \index{matrix multiplication}

    The product $AB$ of matrices $A$ and $B$
    is defined if $A$ is of size $a \times n$
    and $B$ is of size $n \times b$, i.e.,
    the width of $A$ equals the height of $B$.
    The result is a matrix of size $a \times b$
    whose elements are calculated using the formula
    \[
    AB[i,j] = \sum_{k=1}^n A[i,k] \cdot B[k,j].
    \]

    The idea is that each element of $AB$
    is a sum of products of elements of $A$ and $B$
    according to the following picture:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,3);
    \draw (5,0) grid (10,3);
    \draw (5,4) grid (10,8);

    \node at (2,-1) {$A$};
    \node at (7.5,-1) {$AB$};
    \node at (11,6) {$B$};

    \draw[thick,->,red,line width=2pt] (0,1.5) -- (4,1.5);
    \draw[thick,->,red,line width=2pt] (6.5,8) -- (6.5,4);
    \draw[thick,red,line width=2pt] (6.5,1.5) circle (0.4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    For example,

    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 6 \\
      2 & 9 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 2 & 1 \cdot 6 + 4 \cdot 9 \\
      3 \cdot 1 + 9 \cdot 2 & 3 \cdot 6 + 9 \cdot 9 \\
      8 \cdot 1 + 6 \cdot 2 & 8 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 9 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      9 & 42 \\
      21 & 99 \\
      20 & 102 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    Matrix multiplication is associative,
    so $A(BC)=(AB)C$ holds,
    but it is not commutative,
    so $AB = BA$ does not usually hold.

    \index{identity matrix}

    An \key{identity matrix} is a square matrix
    where each element on the diagonal is 1
    and all other elements are 0.
    For example, the following matrix
    is the $3 \times 3$ identity matrix:
    \[
     I = \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \]

    \begin{samepage}
    Multiplying a matrix by an identity matrix
    does not change it. For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix} \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px}
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 4 \\
      3 & 9 \\
      8 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]
    \end{samepage}

    Using a straightforward algorithm,
    we can calculate the product of
    two $n \times n$ matrices
    in $O(n^3)$ time.
    There are also more efficient algorithms
    for matrix multiplication\footnote{The first such
    algorithm was Strassen's algorithm,
    published in 1969 \cite{str69},
    whose time complexity is $O(n^{2.80735})$;
    the best current algorithm \cite{gal14}
    works in $O(n^{2.37286})$ time.},
    but they are mostly of theoretical interest
    and such algorithms are not necessary
    in competitive programming.


    \subsubsection{Matrix power}

    \index{matrix power}

    The power $A^k$ of a matrix $A$ is defined
    if $A$ is a square matrix.
    The definition is based on matrix multiplication:
    \[ A^k = \underbrace{A \cdot A \cdot A \cdots A}_{\textrm{$k$ times}} \]
    For example,

    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^3 =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix} \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix} \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix} =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      48 & 165 \\
      33 & 114 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]
    In addition, $A^0$ is an identity matrix. For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^0 =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}.
    \]

    The matrix $A^k$ can be efficiently calculated
    in $O(n^3 \log k)$ time using the
    algorithm in Chapter 21.2. For example,
    \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^8 =
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^4 \cdot
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 5 \\
      1 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}^4.
    \]

    \subsubsection{Determinant}

    \index{determinant}

    The \key{determinant} $\det(A)$ of a matrix $A$
    is defined if $A$ is a square matrix.
    If $A$ is of size $1 \times 1$,
    then $\det(A)=A[1,1]$.
    The determinant of a larger matrix is
    calculated recursively using the formula \index{cofactor}
    \[\det(A)=\sum_{j=1}^n A[1,j] C[1,j],\]
    where $C[i,j]$ is the \key{cofactor} of $A$
    at $[i,j]$.
    The cofactor is calculated using the formula
    \[C[i,j] = (-1)^{i+j} \det(M[i,j]),\]
    where $M[i,j]$ is obtained by removing
    row $i$ and column $j$ from $A$.
    Due to the coefficient $(-1)^{i+j}$ in the cofactor,
    every other determinant is positive
    and negative.
    For example,
    \[
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      3 & 4 \\
      1 & 6 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    ) = 3 \cdot 6 - 4 \cdot 1 = 14 
    \]
    and
    \[
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 4 & 3 \\
      5 & 1 & 6 \\
      7 & 2 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    ) = 
    2 \cdot
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 6 \\
      2 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    )
    -4 \cdot
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      5 & 6 \\
      7 & 4 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    )
    +3 \cdot
    \det(
     \begin{bmatrix}
      5 & 1 \\
      7 & 2 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    ) = 81.
    \]

    \index{inverse matrix}

    The determinant of $A$ tells us
    whether there is an \key{inverse matrix}
    $A^{-1}$ such that $A \cdot A^{-1} = I$,
    where $I$ is an identity matrix.
    It turns out that $A^{-1}$ exists
    exactly when $\det(A) \neq 0$,
    and it can be calculated using the formula

    \[A^{-1}[i,j] = \frac{C[j,i]}{det(A)}.\]

    For example,

    \[
    \underbrace{
     \begin{bmatrix}
      2 & 4 & 3\\
      5 & 1 & 6\\
      7 & 2 & 4\\
     \end{bmatrix}
    }_{A}
    \cdot
    \underbrace{
     \frac{1}{81}
     \begin{bmatrix}
       -8 & -10 & 21 \\
       22 & -13 & 3 \\
       3 & 24 & -18 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    }_{A^{-1}}
    =
    \underbrace{
     \begin{bmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 1 \\
     \end{bmatrix}
    }_{I}.

    Title: Continued fractions
    Part: 8/12
    ```

        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\frac{x+y \sqrt{n}}{z}$.

    !!! example "[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)"
        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            x, k = map(int, input().split())

            mod = 10**9+7
        
            # compose (A[0]*x + A[1]) / (A[2]*x + A[3]) and (B[0]*x + B[1]) / (B[2]*x + B[3])
            def combine(A, B):
                return [t % mod for t in [A[0]*B[0]+A[1]*B[2], A[0]*B[1]+A[1]*B[3], A[2]*B[0]+A[3]*B[2], A[2]*B[1]+A[3]*B[3]]]

            A = [1, 0, 0, 1] # (x + 0) / (0*x + 1) = x

            a = sqrt(x)

    ### Properties

    As for the cross product, it equals to the zero vector iff the vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ are collinear (they form a common line, i.e. they are parallel).
    The same thing holds for the triple product, it is equal to zero iff the vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ are coplanar (they form a common plane).

    From this we can obtain universal equations defining lines and planes.
    A line can be defined via its direction vector $\mathbf d$ and an initial point $\mathbf r_0$ or by two points $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$.
    It is defined as $(\mathbf r - \mathbf r_0)\times\mathbf d=0$ or as $(\mathbf r - \mathbf a)\times (\mathbf b - \mathbf a) = 0$.
    As for planes, it can be defined by three points $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ as $(\mathbf r - \mathbf a)\cdot((\mathbf b - \mathbf a)\times (\mathbf c - \mathbf a))=0$ or by initial point $\mathbf r_0$ and two direction vectors lying in this plane $\mathbf d_1$ and $\mathbf d_2$: $(\mathbf r - \mathbf r_0)\cdot(\mathbf d_1\times \mathbf d_2)=0$.

    In 2D the pseudo-scalar product also may be used to check the orientation between two vectors because it is positive if the rotation from the first to the second vector is clockwise and negative otherwise.
    And, of course, it can be used to calculate areas of polygons, which is described in a different article.
    A triple product can be used for the same purpose in 3D space.

    ## Exercises

    ### Line intersection

    There are many possible ways to define a line in 2D and you shouldn't hesitate to combine them.
    For example we have two lines and we want to find their intersection points.
    We can say that all points from first line can be parameterized as $\mathbf r = \mathbf a_1 + t \cdot \mathbf d_1$ where $\mathbf a_1$ is initial point, $\mathbf d_1$ is direction and $t$ is some real parameter.
    As for second line all its points must satisfy $(\mathbf r - \mathbf a_2)\times \mathbf d_2=0$. From this we can easily find parameter $t$:

    $$(\mathbf a_1 + t \cdot \mathbf d_1 - \mathbf a_2)\times \mathbf d_2=0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad t = \dfrac{(\mathbf a_2 - \mathbf a_1)\times\mathbf d_2}{\mathbf d_1\times \mathbf d_2}$$

    Let's implement function to intersect two lines.

    ```{.cpp file=basic_line_intersection}
    point2d intersect(point2d a1, point2d d1, point2d a2, point2d d2) {
        return a1 + cross(a2 - a1, d2) / cross(d1, d2) * d1;
    }
    ```

    ### Planes intersection

    However sometimes it might be hard to use some geometric insights.
    For example, you're given three planes defined by initial points $\mathbf a_i$ and directions $\mathbf d_i$ and you want to find their intersection point.
    You may note that you just have to solve the system of equations:

    $$\begin{cases}\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n_1 = \mathbf a_1\cdot \mathbf n_1, \\ \mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n_2 = \mathbf a_2\cdot \mathbf n_2, \\ \mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n_3 = \mathbf a_3\cdot \mathbf n_3\end{cases}$$

    Instead of thinking on geometric approach, you can work out an algebraic one which can be obtained immediately.
    For example, given that you already implemented a point class, it will be easy for you to solve this system using Cramer's rule because the triple product is simply the determinant of the matrix obtained from the vectors being its columns:

    ```{.cpp file=plane_intersection}
    point3d intersect(point3d a1, point3d n1, point3d a2, point3d n2, point3d a3, point3d n3) {
        point3d x(n1.x, n2.x, n3.x);
        point3d y(n1.y, n2.y, n3.y);
        point3d z(n1.z, n2.z, n3.z); 
        point3d d(dot(a1, n1), dot(a2, n2), dot(a3, n3));
        return point3d(triple(d, y, z),
                       triple(x, d, z),
                       triple(x, y, d)) / triple(n1, n2, n3);
    }
    ```

    Now you may try to find out approaches for common geometric operations yourself to get used to all this stuff.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/445 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes two tuples, each containing pairs of numbers. The function should multiply the corresponding elements of these pairs index-wise and return a new tuple with the results.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will iterate through both tuples simultaneously. For each index, we will multiply the first element of the first tuple with the first element of the second tuple, and the second element of the first tuple with the second element of the second tuple. We will store these products in a new tuple and return it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):
       create an empty list to store results
       for each index i from 0 to length of tuple1:
           multiply tuple1[i][0] with tuple2[i][0] and store in results
           multiply tuple1[i][1] with tuple2[i][1] and store in results
       convert results list to a tuple
       return the tuple
   ```
