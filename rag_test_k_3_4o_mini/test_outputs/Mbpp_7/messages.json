the root - with the index $0$.\n\n    Now we implement a function that will add a string $s$ to the trie.\n    The implementation is simple:\n    we start at the root node, and as long as there are edges corresponding to the characters of $s$ we follow them.\n    If there is no edge for one character, we generate a new vertex and connect it with an edge.\n    At the end of the process we mark the last vertex with the flag $\\text{output}$.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=aho_corasick_trie_add}\n    void add_string(string const& s) {\n        int v = 0;\n        for (char ch : s) {\n            int c = ch - 'a';\n            if (trie[v].next[c] == -1) {\n                trie[v].next[c] = trie.size();\n                trie.emplace_back();\n            }\n            v = trie[v].next[c];\n        }\n        trie[v].output = true;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Suffix Automaton\n    Part: 7/7\n    ```\n\n    ### Shortest non-appearing string\n\n    Given a string $S$ and a certain alphabet.\n    We have to find a string of smallest length, that doesn't appear in $S$.\n\n    We will apply dynamic programming on the suffix automaton built for the string $S$.\n\n    Let $d[v]$ be the answer for the node $v$, i.e. we already processed part of the substring, are currently in the state $v$, and want to find the smallest number of characters that have to be added to find a non-existent transition.\n    Computing $d[v]$ is very simple.\n    If there is not transition using at least one character of the alphabet, then $d[v] = 1$.\n    Otherwise one character is not enough, and so we need to take the minimum of all answers of all transitions:\n\n    $$d[v] = 1 + \\min_{w:(v,w,c) \\in SA} d[w].$$\n\n    The answer to the problem will be $d[t_0]$, and the actual string can be restored using the computed array $d[]$.\n\n    ### Longest common substring of two strings\n\n    Given two strings $S$ and $T$.\n    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in $S$ and also in $T$.\n\n    We construct a suffix automaton for the string $S$.\n\n    We will now take the string $T$, and for each prefix look for the longest suffix of this prefix in $S$.\n    In other words, for each position in the string $T$, we want to find the longest common substring of $S$ and $T$ ending in that position.\n\n    For this we will use two variables, the **current state** $v$, and the **current length** $l$.\n    These two variables will describe the current matching part: its length and the state that corresponds to it.\n\n    Initially $v = t_0$ and $l = 0$, i.e. the match is empty.\n\n    Now let us describe how we can add a character $T[i]$ and recalculate the answer for it.\n\n      - If there is a transition from $v$ with the character $T[i]$, then we simply follow the transition and increase $l$ by one.\n      - If there is no such transition, we have to shorten the current matching part, which means that we need to follow the suffix link: $v = link(v)$.\n        At the same time, the current length has to be shortened.\n        Obviously we need to assign $l = len(v)$, since after passing through the suffix link we end up in state whose corresponding longest string is a substring.\n      - If there is still no transition using the required character, we repeat and again go through the suffix link and decrease $l$, until we find a transition or we reach the fictional state $-1$ (which means that the symbol $T[i]$ doesn't appear at all in $S$, so we assign $v = l = 0$).\n\n    The answer to the task will be the maximum of all the values $l$.\n\n    The complexity of this part is $O(length(T))$, since in one move we can either increase $l$ by one, or make several passes through the suffix links, each one ends up reducing the value $l$.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    string lcs (string S, string T) {\n        sa_init();\n        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++)\n            sa_extend(S[i]);\n \n        int v = 0, l = 0, best = 0, bestpos = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < T.size(); i++) {\n            while (v && !st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st[v].link ;\n                l = st[v].len;\n            }\n            if (st[v].next.count(T[i])) {\n                v = st [v].next[T[i]];\n                l++;\n            }\n            if (l > best) {\n                best = l;\n                bestpos = i;\n            }\n        }\n        return T.substr(bestpos - best + 1, best);\n    } \n    ```\n\n    ### Largest common substring of multiple strings\n\n    There are $k$ strings $S_i$ given.\n    We have to find the longest common substring, i.e. such a string $X$ that appears as substring in each string $S_i$.\n\n    We join all strings into one large string $T$, separating the strings by a special characters $D_i$ (one for each string):\n\n    $$T = S_1 + D_1 + S_2 + D_2 + \\dots + S_k + D_k.$$\n\n    Then we construct the suffix automaton for the string $T$.\n\n    Now we need to find a string in the machine, which is contained in all the strings $S_i$, and this can be done by using the special added characters.\n    Note that if a substring is included in some string $S_j$, then in the suffix automaton exists a path starting from this substring containing the character $D_j$ and not containing the other characters $D_1, \\dots, D_{j-1}, D_{j+1}, \\dots, D_k$.\n\n    Thus we need to calculate the attainability, which tells us for each state of the machine and each symbol $D_i$ if there exists such a path.\n    This can easily be computed by DFS or BFS and dynamic programming.\n    After that, the answer to the problem will be the string $longest(v)$ for the state $v$, from which the paths were exists for all special characters.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Prefix function. Knuth\u2013Morris\u2013Pratt algorithm\n    Part: 3/4\n    ```\n\n    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\\pi$, and then compute the final answers:\n    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.\n    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.\n\n    Now let us consider the second problem.\n    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:\n    we create the string $s + \\# + t$ and compute its prefix function.\n    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\\pi[i]$ for $i \\ge n + 1$.\n    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.\n\n    ### The number of different substring in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.\n\n    We will solve this problem iteratively.\n    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.\n\n    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.\n    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.\n    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.\n\n    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.\n    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.\n    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\\pi_{\\text{max}}$ long.\n    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.\n\n    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \\pi_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.\n\n    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.\n\n    ### Compressing a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.\n    We want to find the shortest \"compressed\" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.\n\n    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.\n    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \\pi[n - 1]$.\n    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.\n\n    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.\n    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.\n    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.\n    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.\n    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.\n    And so on.\n    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.\n\n    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.\n    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.\n    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.\n\n    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.\n    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.\n    We prove it by contradiction.\n    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).\n    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.\n    Now consider the second block of the string.\n    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.\n    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.\n    Contradiction.\n\n    $$\\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \\overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$\n\n    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \\underbrace{\\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\\pi[7] = 5}$$\n\n    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \\Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$\n\n    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function\n\n    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \\# + t$.\n    Obviously, since $\\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.\n    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \\#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:\n\n    $$\\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \\dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \\#}_{\\text{need to store}} ~ \\underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \\dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\\text{do not need to store}}$$\n\n    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \\in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.\n\n    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.\n\n    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\\text{old}_\\pi, c) \\rightarrow \\text{new}_\\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {\n                int j = i;\n                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])\n                    j = pi[j-1];\n                if ('a' + c == s[j])\n                    j++;\n                aut[i][c] = j;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.\n    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.\n    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}\n    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {\n        s += '#';\n        int n = s.size();\n        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);\n        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));\n        for (int i = 0;
