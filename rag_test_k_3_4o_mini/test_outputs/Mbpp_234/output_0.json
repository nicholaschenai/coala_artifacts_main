    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the volume of a cube based on the length of its side. The volume of a cube is determined by raising the side length to the power of three.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the volume of a cube, we need to take the side length as input and compute the volume using the formula \\( \\text{Volume} = \\text{side length}^3 \\). This can be done using the exponentiation operator in Python.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION volume_cube(side_length):\n       RETURN side_length raised to the power of 3\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the volume of a cube\ndef volume_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # The volume of a cube is calculated as side_length cubed\n    return side_length ** 3  # Return the result of side_length raised to the power of 3\n```",
