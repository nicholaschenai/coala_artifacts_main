INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/234 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the volume of a cube based on the length of one of its sides. The volume of a cube is found by raising the side length to the power of three.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the volume of a cube, we will take the side length as input and compute the volume by multiplying the side length by itself three times (or raising it to the power of three). The result will be returned as the output of the function.

    Title: Basic Geometry
    Part: 2/3
    ```

    To see the next important property we should take a look at the set of points $\mathbf r$ for which $\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf a = C$ for some fixed constant $C$.
    You can see that this set of points is exactly the set of points for which the projection onto $\mathbf a$ is the point $C \cdot \dfrac{\mathbf a}{|\mathbf a|}$ and they form a hyperplane orthogonal to $\mathbf a$.
    You can see the vector $\mathbf a$ alongside with several such vectors having same dot product with it in 2D on the picture below:

    <center>![Vectors having same dot product with a](https://i.imgur.com/eyO7St4.png)</center>

    In 2D these vectors will form a line, in 3D they will form a plane.
    Note that this result allows us to define a line in 2D as $\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n=C$ or $(\mathbf r - \mathbf r_0)\cdot \mathbf n=0$ where $\mathbf n$ is vector orthogonal to the line and $\mathbf r_0$ is any vector already present on the line and $C = \mathbf r_0\cdot \mathbf n$.
    In the same manner a plane can be defined in 3D.

    ## Cross product

    ### Definition

    Assume you have three vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ in 3D space joined in a parallelepiped as in the picture below:
    <center>![Three vectors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Parallelepiped_volume.svg/240px-Parallelepiped_volume.svg.png)</center>

    How would you calculate its volume?
    From school we know that we should multiply the area of the base with the height, which is projection of $\mathbf a$ onto direction orthogonal to base.
    That means that if we define $\mathbf b \times \mathbf c$ as the vector which is orthogonal to both $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ and which length is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ then $|\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times\mathbf c)|$ will be equal to the volume of the parallelepiped.
    For integrity we will say that $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ will be always directed in such way that the rotation from the vector $\mathbf b$ to the vector $\mathbf c$ from the point of $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ is always counter-clockwise (see the picture below).

    <center>![cross product](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Cross_product_vector.svg/250px-Cross_product_vector.svg.png)</center>

    This defines the cross (or vector) product $\mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ of the vectors $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ and the triple product $\mathbf a\cdot(\mathbf b\times \mathbf c)$ of the vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$.

    Some notable properties of cross and triple products:

    1.  $\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = -\mathbf b\times \mathbf a$
    2.  $(\alpha \cdot \mathbf a)\times \mathbf b = \alpha \cdot (\mathbf a\times \mathbf b)$
    3.  For any $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ there is exactly one vector $\mathbf r$ such that $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf a\cdot\mathbf r$ for any vector $\mathbf a$. <br>Indeed if there are two such vectors $\mathbf r_1$ and $\mathbf r_2$ then $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf r_1 - \mathbf r_2)=0$ for all vectors $\mathbf a$ which is possible only when $\mathbf r_1 = \mathbf r_2$.
    4.  $\mathbf a\cdot (\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf b\cdot (\mathbf c\times \mathbf a) = -\mathbf a\cdot( \mathbf c\times \mathbf b)$
    5.  $(\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c = \mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c$.
        Indeed for all vectors $\mathbf r$ the chain of equations holds:

        \[\mathbf r\cdot( (\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c) = (\mathbf a + \mathbf b) \cdot (\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) =  \mathbf a \cdot(\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) + \mathbf b\cdot(\mathbf c\times \mathbf r) = \mathbf r\cdot (\mathbf a\times \mathbf c) + \mathbf r\cdot(\mathbf b\times \mathbf c) = \mathbf r\cdot(\mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c)\]

        Which proves $(\mathbf a + \mathbf b)\times \mathbf c = \mathbf a\times \mathbf c + \mathbf b\times \mathbf c$ due to point 3.

    6.  $|\mathbf a\times \mathbf b|=|\mathbf a| \cdot |\mathbf b| \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is angle between $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$, since $|\mathbf a\times \mathbf b|$ equals to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$. 

    Given all this and that the following equation holds for the unit vectors

    $$\mathbf e_x\times \mathbf e_x = \mathbf e_y\times \mathbf e_y = \mathbf e_z\times \mathbf e_z = \mathbf 0,\\
    \mathbf e_x\times \mathbf e_y = \mathbf e_z,~\mathbf e_y\times \mathbf e_z = \mathbf e_x,~\mathbf e_z\times \mathbf e_x = \mathbf e_y$$

    we can calculate the cross product of $\mathbf a = (x_1;y_1;z_1)$ and $\mathbf b = (x_2;y_2;z_2)$ in coordinate form:

    $$\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = (x_1 \cdot \mathbf e_x + y_1 \cdot \mathbf e_y + z_1 \cdot \mathbf e_z)\times (x_2 \cdot \mathbf e_x + y_2 \cdot \mathbf e_y + z_2 \cdot \mathbf e_z) =$$

    $$(y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2)\mathbf e_x  + (z_1 x_2 - x_1 z_2)\mathbf e_y + (x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2)$$

    Which also can be written in the more elegant form:

    $$\mathbf a\times \mathbf b = \begin{vmatrix}\mathbf e_x & \mathbf e_y & \mathbf e_z \\ x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \end{vmatrix},~a\cdot(b\times c) = \begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\ x_3 & y_3 & z_3 \end{vmatrix}$$

    Here $| \cdot |$ stands for the determinant of a matrix. 

    Some kind of cross product (namely the pseudo-scalar product) can also be implemented in the 2D case.
    If we would like to calculate the area of parallelogram formed by vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ we would compute $|\mathbf e_z\cdot(\mathbf a\times \mathbf b)| = |x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2|$.
    Another way to obtain the same result is to multiply $|\mathbf a|$ (base of parallelogram) with the height, which is the projection of vector $\mathbf b$ onto vector $\mathbf a$ rotated by $90^\circ$ which in turn is $\widehat{\mathbf a}=(-y_1;x_1)$.
    That is, to calculate $|\widehat{\mathbf a}\cdot\mathbf b|=|x_1y_2 - y_1 x_2|$. 

    If we will take the sign into consideration then the area will be positive if the rotation from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ (i.e. from the view of the point of $\mathbf e_z$) is performed counter-clockwise and negative otherwise.
    That defines the pseudo-scalar product.
    Note that it also equals $|\mathbf a| \cdot |\mathbf b| \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is angle from $\mathbf a$ to $\mathbf b$ count counter-clockwise (and negative if rotation is clockwise).

    Let's implement all this stuff!

    ```{.cpp file=crossproduct}
    point3d cross(point3d a, point3d b) {
        return point3d(a.y * b.z - a.z * b.y,
                       a.z * b.x - a.x * b.z,
                       a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x);
    }
    ftype triple(point3d a, point3d b, point3d c) {
        return dot(a, cross(b, c));
    }
    ftype cross(point2d a, point2d b) {
        return a.x * b.y - a.y * b.x;
    }

    Title: Binary Exponentiation
    Part: 1/2
    # Binary Exponentiation

    Binary exponentiation (also known as exponentiation by squaring) is a trick which allows to calculate $a^n$ using only $O(\log n)$ multiplications (instead of $O(n)$ multiplications required by the naive approach).

    It also has important applications in many tasks unrelated to arithmetic, since it
    can be used with any operations that have the property of **associativity**:

    $$(X \cdot Y) \cdot Z = X \cdot (Y \cdot Z)$$

    Most obviously this applies to modular multiplication, to multiplication of matrices and
    to other problems which we will discuss below.

    ## Algorithm

    Raising $a$ to the power of $n$ is expressed naively as multiplication by $a$ done $n - 1$ times:
    $a^{n} = a \cdot a \cdot \ldots \cdot a$. However, this approach is not practical for large $a$ or $n$.

    $a^{b+c} = a^b \cdot a^c$ and $a^{2b} = a^b \cdot a^b = (a^b)^2$.

    The idea of binary exponentiation is, that we split the work using the binary representation of the exponent.

    Let's write $n$ in base 2, for example:

    $$3^{13} = 3^{1101_2} = 3^8 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 3^1$$

    Since the number $n$ has exactly $\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor + 1$ digits in base 2, we only need to perform $O(\log n)$ multiplications, if we know the powers $a^1, a^2, a^4, a^8, \dots, a^{2^{\lfloor \log n \rfloor}}$.

    So we only need to know a fast way to compute those.
    Luckily this is very easy, since an element in the sequence is just the square of the previous element.

    $$\begin{align}
    3^1 &= 3 \\
    3^2 &= \left(3^1\right)^2 = 3^2 = 9 \\
    3^4 &= \left(3^2\right)^2 = 9^2 = 81 \\
    3^8 &= \left(3^4\right)^2 = 81^2 = 6561
    \end{align}$$

    So to get the final answer for $3^{13}$, we only need to multiply three of them (skipping $3^2$ because the corresponding bit in $n$ is not set):
    $3^{13} = 6561 \cdot 81 \cdot 3 = 1594323$

    The final complexity of this algorithm is $O(\log n)$: we have to compute $\log n$ powers of $a$, and then have to do at most $\log n$ multiplications to get the final answer from them.

    The following recursive approach expresses the same idea:

    $$a^n = \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if } n == 0 \\
    \left(a^{\frac{n}{2}}\right)^2 &\text{if } n > 0 \text{ and } n \text{ even}\\
    \left(a^{\frac{n - 1}{2}}\right)^2 \cdot a &\text{if } n > 0 \text{ and } n \text{ odd}\\
    \end{cases}$$

    ## Implementation

    First the recursive approach, which is a direct translation of the recursive formula:

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
        if (b == 0)
            return 1;
        long long res = binpow(a, b / 2);
        if (b % 2)
            return res * res * a;
        else
            return res * res;
    }
    ```

    The second approach accomplishes the same task without recursion.
    It computes all the powers in a loop, and multiplies the ones with the corresponding set bit in $n$.
    Although the complexity of both approaches is identical, this approach will be faster in practice since we don't have the overhead of the recursive calls.

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b) {
        long long res = 1;
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1)
                res = res * a;
            a = a * a;
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```

    ## Applications

    ### Effective computation of large exponents modulo a number

    **Problem:**
    Compute $x^n \bmod m$.
    This is a very common operation. For instance it is used in computing the [modular multiplicative inverse](module-inverse.md).

    **Solution:**
    Since we know that the modulo operator doesn't interfere with multiplications ($a \cdot b \equiv (a \bmod m) \cdot (b \bmod m) \pmod m$), we can directly use the same code, and just replace every multiplication with a modular multiplication:

    ```cpp
    long long binpow(long long a, long long b, long long m) {
        a %= m;
        long long res = 1;
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1)
                res = res * a % m;
            a = a * a % m;
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
    ```

    **Note:**
    It's possible to speed this algorithm for large $b >> m$.
    If $m$ is a prime number $x^n \equiv x^{n \bmod (m-1)} \pmod{m}$ for prime $m$, and $x^n \equiv x^{n \bmod{\phi(m)}} \pmod{m}$ for composite $m$.
    This follows directly from Fermat's little theorem and Euler's theorem, see the article about [Modular Inverses](module-inverse.md#fermat-euler) for more details.

    ### Effective computation of Fibonacci numbers

    **Problem:** Compute $n$-th Fibonacci number $F_n$.

    **Solution:** For more details, see the [Fibonacci Number article](fibonacci-numbers.md).
    We will only go through an overview of the algorithm.
    To compute the next Fibonacci number, only the two previous ones are needed, as $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
    We can build a $2 \times 2$ matrix that describes this transformation:
    the transition from $F_i$ and $F_{i+1}$ to $F_{i+1}$ and $F_{i+2}$.
    For example, applying this transformation to the pair $F_0$ and $F_1$ would change it into $F_1$ and $F_2$.
    Therefore, we can raise this transformation matrix to the $n$-th power to find $F_n$ in time complexity $O(\log n)$.

    ### Applying a permutation $k$ times { data-toc-label='Applying a permutation <script type="math/tex">k</script> times' }

    **Problem:** You are given a sequence of length $n$. Apply to it a given permutation $k$ times.

    **Solution:** Simply raise the permutation to $k$-th power using binary exponentiation, and then apply it to the sequence. This will give you a time complexity of $O(n \log k)$.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> applyPermutation(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation) {
        vector<int> newSequence(sequence.size());
        for(int i = 0; i < sequence.size(); i++) {
            newSequence[i] = sequence[permutation[i]];
        }
        return newSequence;
    }

    vector<int> permute(vector<int> sequence, vector<int> permutation, long long b) {
        while (b > 0) {
            if (b & 1) {
                sequence = applyPermutation(sequence, permutation);
            }
            permutation = applyPermutation(permutation, permutation);
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return sequence;
    }

    The \key{Fibonacci numbers}

    for calculating Fibonacci numbers, which is sometimes called
    \index{Binet's formula} \key{Binet's formula}:
    \[f(n)=\frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})^n - (1-\sqrt{5})^n}{2^n \sqrt{5}}.\]

    \subsubsection{Logarithms}

    \index{logarithm}

    The \key{logarithm} of a number $x$
    is denoted $\log_k(x)$, where $k$ is the base
    of the logarithm.
    According to the definition,
    $\log_k(x)=a$ exactly when $k^a=x$.

    A useful property of logarithms is
    that $\log_k(x)$ equals the number of times
    we have to divide $x$ by $k$ before we reach 
    the number 1.
    For example, $\log_2(32)=5$
    because 5 divisions by 2 are needed:

    \[32 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \]

    Logarithms are often used in the analysis of
    algorithms, because many efficient algorithms
    halve something at each step.
    Hence, we can estimate the efficiency of such algorithms
    using logarithms.

    The logarithm of a product is
    \[\log_k(ab) = \log_k(a)+\log_k(b),\]
    and consequently,
    \[\log_k(x^n) = n \cdot \log_k(x).\]
    In addition, the logarithm of a quotient is
    \[\log_k\Big(\frac{a}{b}\Big) = \log_k(a)-\log_k(b).\]
    Another useful formula is
    \[\log_u(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(u)},\]
    and using this, it is possible to calculate
    logarithms to any base if there is a way to
    calculate logarithms to some fixed base.

    \index{natural logarithm}

    The \key{natural logarithm} $\ln(x)$ of a number $x$
    is a logarithm whose base is $e \approx 2.71828$.
    Another property of logarithms is that
    the number of digits of an integer $x$ in base $b$ is
    $\lfloor \log_b(x)+1 \rfloor$.
    For example, the representation of
    $123$ in base $2$ is 1111011 and
    $\lfloor \log_2(123)+1 \rfloor = 7$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/234 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the volume of a cube based on the length of its side. The volume of a cube is determined by raising the side length to the power of three.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the volume of a cube, we need to take the side length as input and compute the volume using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \text{side length}^3 \). This can be done using the exponentiation operator in Python.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   FUNCTION volume_cube(side_length):
       RETURN side_length raised to the power of 3
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function to calculate the volume of a cube
def volume_cube(side_length: int) -> int:
    # The volume of a cube is calculated as side_length cubed
    return side_length ** 3  # Return the result of side_length raised to the power of 3
```
