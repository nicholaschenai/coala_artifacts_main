    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: We need to create a function that calculates the area of the largest triangle that can fit inside a semicircle of a given radius. If the radius is negative, the function should return `None`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is an isosceles triangle with its base on the diameter of the semicircle. The area of this triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\). In this case, the base is the diameter of the semicircle (which is \\( 2 \\times \\text{radius} \\)) and the height is equal to the radius. Therefore, the area can be expressed as \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2r) \\times r = r^2 \\).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function triangle_area(radius):\n       if radius < 0:\n           return None\n       else:\n           area = radius * radius\n           return area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef triangle_area(radius):\n    # Check if the radius is negative\n    if radius < 0:\n        return None  # Return None for negative radius\n    else:\n        # Calculate the area of the largest triangle inscribed in the semicircle\n        area = radius * radius  # Area is radius squared\n        return area  # Return the calculated area\n```",
