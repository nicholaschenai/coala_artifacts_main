INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/626 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the area of the largest triangle that can fit inside a semicircle with a given radius. If the radius is negative, the function should return `None`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   For a triangle inscribed in a semicircle, the largest triangle is an isosceles triangle where the base lies on the diameter of the semicircle. The height of this triangle will be equal to the radius of the semicircle. Therefore, the area can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{diameter} \times \text{radius} = \frac{1}{2} \times (2 \times \text{radius}) \times \text{radius} = \text{radius}^2
   \]
   If the radius is negative, we will return `None`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function triangle_area(radius):
       if radius < 0:
           return None
       else:
           area = radius * radius
           return area
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def triangle_area(radius):
    # Check if the radius is negative
    if radius < 0:
        return None  # Return None for negative radius
    else:
        # Calculate the area of the largest triangle inscribed in the semicircle
        area = radius * radius  # Area is radius squared
        return area  # Return the calculated area

    Title: Circle-Circle Intersection
    Part: 1/1
    # Circle-Circle Intersection

    You are given two circles on a 2D plane, each one described as coordinates of its center and its radius. Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).

    ## Solution

    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).

    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$

    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$x \cdot (-2x_2) + y \cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$

    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:

    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$

    $$\begin{align}
    A &= -2x_2 \\
    B &= -2y_2 \\
    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2
    \end{align}$$

    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).

    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.

    Chapter: Geometry
    Section: Polygon area
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Polygon area}

    A general formula for calculating the area
    of a polygon, sometimes called the \key{shoelace formula},
    is as follows: \index{shoelace formula}
    \[\frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (p_i \times p_{i+1})| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|, \]
    Here the vertices are
    $p_1=(x_1,y_1)$, $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$, $\ldots$, $p_n=(x_n,y_n)$
    in such an order that
    $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ are adjacent vertices on the boundary
    of the polygon,
    and the first and last vertex is the same, i.e., $p_1=p_n$.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    is
    \[\frac{|(2\cdot5-5\cdot4)+(5\cdot3-7\cdot5)+(7\cdot1-4\cdot3)+(4\cdot3-4\cdot1)+(4\cdot4-2\cdot3)|}{2} = 17/2.\]

    The idea of the formula is to go through trapezoids
    whose one side is a side of the polygon,
    and another side lies on the horizontal line $y=0$.
    For example:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \path[draw,fill=lightgray] (5,5.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (7,0) -- (5,0) -- (5,5.4);
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);
    \draw (0,0) -- (10,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    The area of such a trapezoid is
    \[(x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2},\]
    where the vertices of the polygon are $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$.
    If $x_{i+1}>x_{i}$, the area is positive,
    and if $x_{i+1}<x_{i}$, the area is negative.

    The area of the polygon is the sum of areas of
    all such trapezoids, which yields the formula
    \[|\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2}| =
    \frac{1}{2} |\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|.\]

    Note that the absolute value of the sum is taken,
    because the value of the sum may be positive or negative,
    depending on whether we walk clockwise or counterclockwise
    along the boundary of the polygon.

    \subsubsection{Pick's theorem}

    \index{Pick's theorem}

    \key{Pick's theorem} provides another way to calculate
    the area of a polygon provided that all vertices 
    of the polygon have integer coordinates.
    According to Pick's theorem, the area of the polygon is
    \[ a + b/2 -1,\]
    where $a$ is the number of integer points inside the polygon
    and $b$ is the number of integer points on the boundary of the polygon.

    For example, the area of the polygon
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};
    \node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};
    \node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};
    \node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};
    \node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};
    \path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);

    \filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (3,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (4,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,4.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,4.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (6,3.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);

    \filldraw (4,2.4) circle (2pt);
    \filldraw (5,2.4) circle (2pt);

    Title: Circle-Line Intersection
    Part: 1/1
    # Circle-Line Intersection

    Given the coordinates of the center of a circle and its radius, and the equation of a line, you're required to find the points of intersection.

    ## Solution

    Instead of solving the system of two equations, we will approach the problem geometrically. This way we get a more accurate solution from the point of view of numerical stability.

    We assume without loss of generality that the circle is centered at the origin. If it's not, we translate it there and correct the $C$ constant in the line equation. So we have a circle centered at $(0,0)$ of radius $r$ and a line with equation $Ax+By+C=0$.

    Let's start by find the point on the line which is closest to the origin $(x_0, y_0)$. First, it has to be at a distance

    $$ d_0 = \frac{|C|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2}} $$

    Second, since the vector $(A, B)$ is perpendicular to the line, the coordinates of the point must be proportional to the coordinates of this vector. Since we know the distance of the point to the origin, we just need to scale the vector $(A, B)$ to this length, and we'll get:

    $$\begin{align}
    x_0 &= - \frac{AC}{A^2 + B^2} \\
    y_0 &= - \frac{BC}{A^2 + B^2} 
    \end{align}$$

    The minus signs are not obvious, but they can be easily verified by substituting $x_0$ and $y_0$ in the equation of the line.

    At this stage we can determine the number of intersection points, and even find the solution when there is one or zero points. Indeed, if the distance from $(x_0, y_0)$ to the origin $d_0$ is greater than the radius $r$, the answer is **zero points**. If $d_0=r$, the answer is **one point** $(x_0, y_0)$. If $d_0<r$, there are two points of intersection, and now we have to find their coordinates.

    So, we know that the point $(x_0, y_0)$ is inside the circle. The two points of intersection, $(a_x, a_y)$ and $(b_x, b_y)$, must belong to the line $Ax+By+C=0$ and must be at the same distance $d$ from $(x_0, y_0)$, and this distance is easy to find:

    $$ d = \sqrt{r^2 - \frac{C^2}{A^2 + B^2}} $$

    Note that the vector $(-B, A)$ is collinear to the line, and thus we can find the points in question by adding and subtracting  vector $(-B,A)$, scaled to the length $d$, to the point $(x_0, y_0)$. 

    Finally, the equations of the two points of intersection are:

    $$\begin{align}
    m &= \sqrt{\frac{d^2}{A^2 + B^2}} \\
    a_x &= x_0 + B \cdot m, a_y = y_0 - A \cdot m \\
    b_x &= x_0 - B \cdot m, b_y = y_0 + A \cdot m
    \end{align}$$

    Had we solved the original system of equations using algebraic methods, we would likely get an answer in a different form with a larger error. The geometric method described here is more graphic and more accurate.

    ## Implementation

    As indicated at the outset, we assume that the circle is centered at the origin, and therefore the input to the program is the radius $r$ of the circle and the parameters $A$, $B$ and $C$ of the equation of the line.

    ```cpp
    double r, a, b, c; // given as input
    double x0 = -a*c/(a*a+b*b), y0 = -b*c/(a*a+b*b);
    if (c*c > r*r*(a*a+b*b)+EPS)
        puts ("no points");
    else if (abs (c*c - r*r*(a*a+b*b)) < EPS) {
        puts ("1 point");
        cout << x0 << ' ' << y0 << '\n';
    }
    else {
        double d = r*r - c*c/(a*a+b*b);
        double mult = sqrt (d / (a*a+b*b));
        double ax, ay, bx, by;
        ax = x0 + b * mult;
        bx = x0 - b * mult;
        ay = y0 - a * mult;
        by = y0 + a * mult;
        puts ("2 points");
        cout << ax << ' ' << ay << '\n' << bx << ' ' << by << '\n';
    }
    ```

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is an isosceles triangle with its base on the diameter of the semicircle. The area of this triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). In this case, the base is the diameter of the semicircle (which is \( 2 \times \text{radius} \)) and the height is equal to the radius.
