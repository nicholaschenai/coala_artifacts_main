INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/630 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a coordinate represented as a tuple (x, y) and returns a list of all adjacent coordinates. Adjacent coordinates are those that differ by at most 1 in either the x or y direction.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the adjacent coordinates, we can iterate through a range of values around the given coordinate. Specifically, we can check the coordinates that are one unit away in all directions (left, right, up, down, and the diagonals). We will collect these coordinates in a list and return them.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `get_coordinates` that takes a tuple `coord`.
   - Initialize an empty list to hold the adjacent coordinates.
   - Use nested loops to iterate through the range of -1 to 1 for both x and y directions.
   - For each combination of x and y offsets, calculate the new coordinates.
   - Append the new coordinates to the list.
   - Return the list of adjacent coordinates.

    Title: Finding the nearest pair of points
    Part: 1/3
    # Finding the nearest pair of points

    ## Problem statement

    Given $n$ points on the plane. Each point $p_i$ is defined by its coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$. It is required to find among them two such points, such that the distance between them is minimal:

    $$ \min_{\scriptstyle i, j=0 \ldots n-1,\atop \scriptstyle i \neq j } \rho (p_i, p_j). $$

    We take the usual Euclidean distances:

    $$ \rho (p_i,p_j) = \sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2} .$$

    The trivial algorithm - iterating over all pairs and calculating the distance for each â€” works in $O(n^2)$. 

    The algorithm running in time $O(n \log n)$ is described below. This algorithm was proposed by Shamos and Hoey in 1975. (Source: Ch. 5 Notes of _Algorithm Design_ by Kleinberg & Tardos, also see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4567872)) Preparata and Shamos also showed that this algorithm is optimal in the decision tree model.

    ## Algorithm
    We construct an algorithm according to the general scheme of **divide-and-conquer** algorithms: the algorithm is designed as a recursive function, to which we pass a set of points; this recursive function splits this set in half, calls itself recursively on each half, and then performs some operations to combine the answers. The operation of combining consist of  detecting the cases when one point of the optimal solution fell into one half, and the other point into the other (in this case, recursive calls from each of the halves cannot detect this pair separately). The main difficulty, as always in case of divide and conquer algorithms, lies in the effective implementation of the merging stage. If a set of $n$ points is passed to the recursive function, then the merge stage should work no more than $O(n)$, then the asymptotics of the whole algorithm $T(n)$ will be found from the equation:

    $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).$$ 

    The solution to this equation, as is known, is $T(n) = O(n \log n).$

    So, we proceed on to the construction of the algorithm. In order to come to an effective implementation of the merge stage in the future, we will divide the set of points into two subsets, according to their $x$-coordinates: In fact, we draw some vertical line dividing the set of points into two subsets of approximately the same size. It is convenient to make such a partition as follows: We sort the points in the standard way as pairs of numbers, ie.:

    $$p_i < p_j \Longleftrightarrow (x_i < x_j) \lor \Big(\left(x_i = x_j\right) \wedge \left(y_i < y_j \right) \Big) $$

    Then take the middle point after sorting $p_m (m = \lfloor n/2 \rfloor)$, and all the points before it and the $p_m$ itself are assigned to the first half, and all the points after it - to the second half:

    $$A_1 = \{p_i \ | \ i = 0 \ldots m \}$$

    $$A_2 = \{p_i \ | \ i = m + 1 \ldots n-1 \}.$$ 

    Now, calling recursively on each of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, we will find the answers $h_1$ and $h_2$ for each of the halves. And take the best of them: $h = \min(h_1, h_2)$.

    Now we need to make a **merge stage**, i.e. we try to find such pairs of points, for which the distance between which is less than $h$ and one point is lying in $A_1$ and the other in $A_2$.
    It is obvious that it is sufficient to consider only those points that are separated from the vertical line by a distance less than $h$, i.e. the set $B$ of the points considered at this stage is equal to:

    $$B = \{ p_i\ | \ | x_i - x_m\ | < h \}.$$ 

    For each point in the set $B$, we try to find the points that are closer to it than $h$. For example, it is sufficient to consider only those points whose $y$-coordinate differs by no more than $h$. Moreover, it makes no sense to consider those points whose $y$-coordinate is greater than the $y$-coordinate of the current point. Thus, for each point $p_i$ we define the set of considered points $C(p_i)$ as follows:

    $$C(p_i) = \{ p_j\ |\ p_j \in B,\ \ y_i - h < y_j \le y_i \}.$$

    If we sort the points of the set $B$ by $y$-coordinate, it will be very easy to find $C(p_i)$: these are several points in a row ahead to the point $p_i$.

    So, in the new notation, the **merging stage** looks like this: build a set $B$, sort the points in it by $y$-coordinate, then for each point $p_i \in B$ consider all points $p_j \in C(p_i)$, and for each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ calculate the distance and compare with the current best distance.

    At first glance, this is still a non-optimal algorithm: it seems that the sizes of sets $C(p_i)$ will be of order $n$, and the required asymptotics will not work. However, surprisingly, it can be proved that the size of each of the sets $C(p_i)$ is a quantity $O(1)$, i.e. it does not exceed some small constant regardless of the points themselves. Proof of this fact is given in the next section.

    Finally, we pay attention to the sorting, which the above algorithm contains: first,sorting by pairs $(x, y)$, and then second, sorting the elements of the set $B$ by $y$. In fact, both of these sorts inside the recursive function can be eliminated (otherwise we would not reach the $O(n)$ estimate for the **merging stage**, and the general asymptotics of the algorithm would be $O(n \log^2 n)$). It is easy to get rid of the first sort â€” it is enough to perform this sort before starting the recursion: after all, the elements themselves do not change inside the recursion, so there is no need to sort again. With the second sorting a little more difficult to perform, performing it previously will not work. But, remembering the merge sort, which also works on the principle of divide-and-conquer, we can simply embed this sort in our recursion. Let recursion, taking some set of points (as we remember,ordered by pairs $(x, y)$), return the same set, but sorted by the $y$-coordinate. To do this, simply merge (in $O(n)$) the two results returned by recursive calls. This will result in a set sorted by $y$-coordinate.

    ## Evaluation of the asymptotics

    To show that the above algorithm is actually executed in $O(n \log n)$, we need to prove the following fact: $|C(p_i)| = O(1)$.

    So, let us consider some point $p_i$; recall that the set $C(p_i)$ is a set of points whose $y$-coordinate lies in the segment $[y_i-h; y_i]$, and, moreover, along the $x$ coordinate, the point $p_i$ itself, and all the points of the set $C(p_i)$ lie in the band width $2h$. In other words, the points we are considering $p_i$ and $C(p_i)$ lie in a rectangle of size $2h \times h$.

    Our task is to estimate the maximum number of points that can lie in this rectangle $2h \times h$; thus, we estimate the maximum size of the set $C(p_i)$. At the same time, when evaluating, we must not forget that there may be repeated points.

    Remember that $h$ was obtained from the results of two recursive calls â€” on sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ contains points to the left of the partition line and partially on it, $A_2$ contains the remaining points of the partition line and points to the right of it. For any pair of points from $A_1$, as well as from $A_2$, the distance can not be less than $h$ â€” otherwise it would mean incorrect operation of the recursive function.

    To estimate the maximum number of points in the rectangle $2h \times h$ we divide it into two squares $h \times h$, the first square include all points $C(p_i) \cap A_1$, and the second contains all the others, i.e. $C(p_i) \cap A_2$. It follows from the above considerations that in each of these squares the distance between any two points is at least $h$.

    We show that there are at most four points in each square. For example, this can be done as follows: divide the square into $4$ sub-squares with sides $h/2$. Then there can be no more than one point in each of these sub-squares (since even the diagonal is equal to $h / \sqrt{2}$, which is less than $h$). Therefore, there can be no more than $4$ points in the whole square.

    So, we have proved that in a rectangle $2h \times h$ can not be more than $4 \cdot 2 = 8$ points, and, therefore, the size of the set $C(p_i)$ cannot exceed $7$, as required.

    \index{distance function}
    \index{Euclidean distance}
    \index{Manhattan distance}

    A \key{distance function} defines the distance between
    two points.
    The usual distance function is the
    \key{Euclidean distance} where the distance between
    points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is
    \[\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}.\]
    An alternative distance function is the
    \key{Manhattan distance}
    where the distance between points
    $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is
    \[|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|.\]
    \begin{samepage}
    For example, consider the following picture:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}

    \draw[fill] (2,1) circle [radius=0.05];
    \draw[fill] (5,2) circle [radius=0.05];

    \node at (2,0.5) {$(2,1)$};
    \node at (5,1.5) {$(5,2)$};

    \draw[dashed] (2,1) -- (5,2);

    \draw[fill] (5+2,1) circle [radius=0.05];
    \draw[fill] (5+5,2) circle [radius=0.05];

    \node at (5+2,0.5) {$(2,1)$};
    \node at (5+5,1.5) {$(5,2)$};

    \draw[dashed] (5+2,1) -- (5+2,2);
    \draw[dashed] (5+2,2) -- (5+5,2);

    \node at (3.5,-0.5) {Euclidean distance};
    \node at (5+3.5,-0.5) {Manhattan distance};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \end{samepage}
    The Euclidean distance between the points is
    \[\sqrt{(5-2)^2+(2-1)^2}=\sqrt{10}\]
    and the Manhattan distance is
    \[|5-2|+|2-1|=4.\]
    The following picture shows regions that are within a distance of 1
    from the center point, using the Euclidean and Manhattan distances:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}

    \draw[fill=gray!20] (0,0) circle [radius=1];
    \draw[fill] (0,0) circle [radius=0.05];

    \node at (0,-1.5) {Euclidean distance};

    \draw[fill=gray!20] (5+0,1) -- (5-1,0) -- (5+0,-1) -- (5+1,0) -- (5+0,1);
    \draw[fill] (5,0) circle [radius=0.05];
    \node at (5,-1.5) {Manhattan distance};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Rotating coordinates}

    Some problems are easier to solve if
    Manhattan distances are used instead of Euclidean distances.
    As an example, consider a problem where we are given
    $n$ points in the two-dimensional plane
    and our task is to calculate the maximum Manhattan
    distance between any two points.

    For example, consider the following set of points:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.65]
    \draw[color=gray] (-1,-1) grid (4,4);

    \filldraw (0,2) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (3,3) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (1,0) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (3,1) circle (2.5pt);

    \node at (0,1.5) {$A$};
    \node at (3,2.5) {$C$};
    \node at (1,-0.5) {$B$};
    \node at (3,0.5) {$D$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    The maximum Manhattan distance is 5
    between points $B$ and $C$:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.65]
    \draw[color=gray] (-1,-1) grid (4,4);

    \filldraw (0,2) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (3,3) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (1,0) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (3,1) circle (2.5pt);

    \node at (0,1.5) {$A$};
    \node at (3,2.5) {$C$};
    \node at (1,-0.5) {$B$};
    \node at (3,0.5) {$D$};

    \path[draw=red,thick,line width=2pt] (1,0) -- (1,3) -- (3,3);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    A useful technique related to Manhattan distances
    is to rotate all coordinates 45 degrees so that
    a point $(x,y)$ becomes $(x+y,y-x)$.
    For example, after rotating the above points,
    the result is:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]
    \draw[color=gray] (0,-3) grid (7,3);

    \filldraw (2,2) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (6,0) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (1,-1) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (4,-2) circle (2.5pt);

    \node at (2,1.5) {$A$};
    \node at (6,-0.5) {$C$};
    \node at (1,-1.5) {$B$};
    \node at (4,-2.5) {$D$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    And the maximum distance is as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]
    \draw[color=gray] (0,-3) grid (7,3);

    \filldraw (2,2) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (6,0) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (1,-1) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (4,-2) circle (2.5pt);

    \node at (2,1.5) {$A$};
    \node at (6,-0.5) {$C$};
    \node at (1,-1.5) {$B$};
    \node at (4,-2.5) {$D$};

    \path[draw=red,thick,line width=2pt] (1,-1) -- (4,2) -- (6,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Consider two points $p_1=(x_1,y_1)$ and $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$ whose rotated
    coordinates are $p'_1=(x'_1,y'_1)$ and $p'_2=(x'_2,y'_2)$.
    Now there are two ways to express the Manhattan distance
    between $p_1$ and $p_2$:
    \[|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| = \max(|x'_1-x'_2|,|y'_1-y'_2|)\]

    For example, if $p_1=(1,0)$ and $p_2=(3,3)$,
    the rotated coordinates are $p'_1=(1,-1)$ and $p'_2=(6,0)$
    and the Manhattan distance is
    \[|1-3|+|0-3| = \max(|1-6|,|-1-0|) = 5.\]

    The rotated coordinates provide a simple way
    to operate with Manhattan distances, because we can
    consider x and y coordinates separately.
    To maximize the Manhattan distance between two points,
    we should find two points whose
    rotated coordinates maximize the value of
    \[\max(|x'_1-x'_2|,|y'_1-y'_2|).\]
    This is easy, because either the horizontal or vertical
    difference of the rotated coordinates has to be maximum.

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/630 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   The task is to create a function that takes a coordinate represented as a tuple (x, y) and returns a list of all adjacent coordinates. Adjacent coordinates are those that differ by at most 1 in either the x or y direction.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find all adjacent coordinates for a given coordinate (x, y), we can generate a list of coordinates by varying x and y by -1, 0, and +1. This will give us a 3x3 grid of coordinates centered around (x, y). We will then filter out the coordinate (x, y) itself from this list to only include the adjacent ones.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function get_coordinates(coordinate):
       x, y = coordinate
       adjacent_coordinates = []
       for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
           for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
               if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                   continue  // skip the center coordinate

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/630 [generation text] Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Expected Output**: 
   The expected output for the input `(3, 4)` is a list of all adjacent coordinates, including the coordinate itself. The expected output is:
   ```
   [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], 
    [3, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], 
    [4, 3], [4, 4], [4, 5]]
   ```
   This means that the function should include the coordinate `(3, 4)` in the output.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   In the original implementation, I skipped the coordinate `(3, 4)` by checking if both `dx` and `dy` were `0`. This was incorrect because the problem statement requires that the coordinate itself should be included in the output.

3. **Correcting the Logic**: 
   To fix the code, I need to ensure that I include the coordinate `(x, y)` in the final output. I can do this by simply appending it to the list of adjacent coordinates after generating the surrounding coordinates.

4. **Revising the Pseudocode**:
   - Generate all adjacent coordinates by varying `dx` and `dy` from -1 to 1.
   - Append each generated coordinate to the list.
   - Finally, append the original coordinate `(x, y)` to the list.

Now, I will implement the corrected solution in Python.

```python
def get_coordinates(coordinate):
    # Extract x and y from the input coordinate tuple
    x, y = coordinate
    # Initialize an empty list to hold adjacent coordinates
    adjacent_coordinates = []
    
    # Loop through possible changes in x and y
    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
            # Append the new adjacent coordinate to the list
            adjacent_coordinates.append([x + dx, y + dy])
    
    # Return the list of adjacent coordinates
    return adjacent_coordinates

    Title: Finding the nearest pair of points
    Part: 1/3
    # Finding the nearest pair of points

    ## Problem statement

    Given $n$ points on the plane. Each point $p_i$ is defined by its coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$. It is required to find among them two such points, such that the distance between them is minimal:

    $$ \min_{\scriptstyle i, j=0 \ldots n-1,\atop \scriptstyle i \neq j } \rho (p_i, p_j). $$

    We take the usual Euclidean distances:

    $$ \rho (p_i,p_j) = \sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2} .$$

    The trivial algorithm - iterating over all pairs and calculating the distance for each â€” works in $O(n^2)$. 

    The algorithm running in time $O(n \log n)$ is described below. This algorithm was proposed by Shamos and Hoey in 1975. (Source: Ch. 5 Notes of _Algorithm Design_ by Kleinberg & Tardos, also see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4567872)) Preparata and Shamos also showed that this algorithm is optimal in the decision tree model.

    ## Algorithm
    We construct an algorithm according to the general scheme of **divide-and-conquer** algorithms: the algorithm is designed as a recursive function, to which we pass a set of points; this recursive function splits this set in half, calls itself recursively on each half, and then performs some operations to combine the answers. The operation of combining consist of  detecting the cases when one point of the optimal solution fell into one half, and the other point into the other (in this case, recursive calls from each of the halves cannot detect this pair separately). The main difficulty, as always in case of divide and conquer algorithms, lies in the effective implementation of the merging stage. If a set of $n$ points is passed to the recursive function, then the merge stage should work no more than $O(n)$, then the asymptotics of the whole algorithm $T(n)$ will be found from the equation:

    $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).$$ 

    The solution to this equation, as is known, is $T(n) = O(n \log n).$

    So, we proceed on to the construction of the algorithm. In order to come to an effective implementation of the merge stage in the future, we will divide the set of points into two subsets, according to their $x$-coordinates: In fact, we draw some vertical line dividing the set of points into two subsets of approximately the same size. It is convenient to make such a partition as follows: We sort the points in the standard way as pairs of numbers, ie.:

    $$p_i < p_j \Longleftrightarrow (x_i < x_j) \lor \Big(\left(x_i = x_j\right) \wedge \left(y_i < y_j \right) \Big) $$

    Then take the middle point after sorting $p_m (m = \lfloor n/2 \rfloor)$, and all the points before it and the $p_m$ itself are assigned to the first half, and all the points after it - to the second half:

    $$A_1 = \{p_i \ | \ i = 0 \ldots m \}$$

    $$A_2 = \{p_i \ | \ i = m + 1 \ldots n-1 \}.$$ 

    Now, calling recursively on each of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, we will find the answers $h_1$ and $h_2$ for each of the halves. And take the best of them: $h = \min(h_1, h_2)$.

    Now we need to make a **merge stage**, i.e. we try to find such pairs of points, for which the distance between which is less than $h$ and one point is lying in $A_1$ and the other in $A_2$.
    It is obvious that it is sufficient to consider only those points that are separated from the vertical line by a distance less than $h$, i.e. the set $B$ of the points considered at this stage is equal to:

    $$B = \{ p_i\ | \ | x_i - x_m\ | < h \}.$$ 

    For each point in the set $B$, we try to find the points that are closer to it than $h$. For example, it is sufficient to consider only those points whose $y$-coordinate differs by no more than $h$. Moreover, it makes no sense to consider those points whose $y$-coordinate is greater than the $y$-coordinate of the current point. Thus, for each point $p_i$ we define the set of considered points $C(p_i)$ as follows:

    $$C(p_i) = \{ p_j\ |\ p_j \in B,\ \ y_i - h < y_j \le y_i \}.$$

    If we sort the points of the set $B$ by $y$-coordinate, it will be very easy to find $C(p_i)$: these are several points in a row ahead to the point $p_i$.

    So, in the new notation, the **merging stage** looks like this: build a set $B$, sort the points in it by $y$-coordinate, then for each point $p_i \in B$ consider all points $p_j \in C(p_i)$, and for each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ calculate the distance and compare with the current best distance.

    At first glance, this is still a non-optimal algorithm: it seems that the sizes of sets $C(p_i)$ will be of order $n$, and the required asymptotics will not work. However, surprisingly, it can be proved that the size of each of the sets $C(p_i)$ is a quantity $O(1)$, i.e. it does not exceed some small constant regardless of the points themselves. Proof of this fact is given in the next section.

    Finally, we pay attention to the sorting, which the above algorithm contains: first,sorting by pairs $(x, y)$, and then second, sorting the elements of the set $B$ by $y$. In fact, both of these sorts inside the recursive function can be eliminated (otherwise we would not reach the $O(n)$ estimate for the **merging stage**, and the general asymptotics of the algorithm would be $O(n \log^2 n)$). It is easy to get rid of the first sort â€” it is enough to perform this sort before starting the recursion: after all, the elements themselves do not change inside the recursion, so there is no need to sort again. With the second sorting a little more difficult to perform, performing it previously will not work. But, remembering the merge sort, which also works on the principle of divide-and-conquer, we can simply embed this sort in our recursion. Let recursion, taking some set of points (as we remember,ordered by pairs $(x, y)$), return the same set, but sorted by the $y$-coordinate. To do this, simply merge (in $O(n)$) the two results returned by recursive calls. This will result in a set sorted by $y$-coordinate.

    ## Evaluation of the asymptotics

    To show that the above algorithm is actually executed in $O(n \log n)$, we need to prove the following fact: $|C(p_i)| = O(1)$.

    So, let us consider some point $p_i$; recall that the set $C(p_i)$ is a set of points whose $y$-coordinate lies in the segment $[y_i-h; y_i]$, and, moreover, along the $x$ coordinate, the point $p_i$ itself, and all the points of the set $C(p_i)$ lie in the band width $2h$. In other words, the points we are considering $p_i$ and $C(p_i)$ lie in a rectangle of size $2h \times h$.

    Our task is to estimate the maximum number of points that can lie in this rectangle $2h \times h$; thus, we estimate the maximum size of the set $C(p_i)$. At the same time, when evaluating, we must not forget that there may be repeated points.

    Remember that $h$ was obtained from the results of two recursive calls â€” on sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ contains points to the left of the partition line and partially on it, $A_2$ contains the remaining points of the partition line and points to the right of it. For any pair of points from $A_1$, as well as from $A_2$, the distance can not be less than $h$ â€” otherwise it would mean incorrect operation of the recursive function.

    To estimate the maximum number of points in the rectangle $2h \times h$ we divide it into two squares $h \times h$, the first square include all points $C(p_i) \cap A_1$, and the second contains all the others, i.e. $C(p_i) \cap A_2$. It follows from the above considerations that in each of these squares the distance between any two points is at least $h$.

    We show that there are at most four points in each square. For example, this can be done as follows: divide the square into $4$ sub-squares with sides $h/2$. Then there can be no more than one point in each of these sub-squares (since even the diagonal is equal to $h / \sqrt{2}$, which is less than $h$). Therefore, there can be no more than $4$ points in the whole square.

    So, we have proved that in a rectangle $2h \times h$ can not be more than $4 \cdot 2 = 8$ points, and, therefore, the size of the set $C(p_i)$ cannot exceed $7$, as required.

    \section{Distance functions}

    \index{distance function}
    \index{Euclidean distance}
    \index{Manhattan distance}

    A \key{distance function} defines the distance between
    two points.
    The usual distance function is the
    \key{Euclidean distance} where the distance between
    points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is
    \[\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}.\]
    An alternative distance function is the
    \key{Manhattan distance}
    where the distance between points
    $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is
    \[|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|.\]
    \begin{samepage}
    For example, consider the following picture:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}

    \draw[fill] (2,1) circle [radius=0.05];
    \draw[fill] (5,2) circle [radius=0.05];

    \node at (2,0.5) {$(2,1)$};
    \node at (5,1.5) {$(5,2)$};

    \draw[dashed] (2,1) -- (5,2);

    \draw[fill] (5+2,1) circle [radius=0.05];
    \draw[fill] (5+5,2) circle [radius=0.05];

    \node at (5+2,0.5) {$(2,1)$};
    \node at (5+5,1.5) {$(5,2)$};

    \draw[dashed] (5+2,1) -- (5+2,2);
    \draw[dashed] (5+2,2) -- (5+5,2);

    \node at (3.5,-0.5) {Euclidean distance};
    \node at (5+3.5,-0.5) {Manhattan distance};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \end{samepage}
    The Euclidean distance between the points is
    \[\sqrt{(5-2)^2+(2-1)^2}=\sqrt{10}\]
    and the Manhattan distance is
    \[|5-2|+|2-1|=4.\]
    The following picture shows regions that are within a distance of 1
    from the center point, using the Euclidean and Manhattan distances:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}

    \draw[fill=gray!20] (0,0) circle [radius=1];
    \draw[fill] (0,0) circle [radius=0.05];

    \node at (0,-1.5) {Euclidean distance};

    \draw[fill=gray!20] (5+0,1) -- (5-1,0) -- (5+0,-1) -- (5+1,0) -- (5+0,1);
    \draw[fill] (5,0) circle [radius=0.05];
    \node at (5,-1.5) {Manhattan distance};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Rotating coordinates}

    Some problems are easier to solve if
    Manhattan distances are used instead of Euclidean distances.
    As an example, consider a problem where we are given
    $n$ points in the two-dimensional plane
    and our task is to calculate the maximum Manhattan
    distance between any two points.

    For example, consider the following set of points:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.65]
    \draw[color=gray] (-1,-1) grid (4,4);

    \filldraw (0,2) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (3,3) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (1,0) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (3,1) circle (2.5pt);

    \node at (0,1.5) {$A$};
    \node at (3,2.5) {$C$};
    \node at (1,-0.5) {$B$};
    \node at (3,0.5) {$D$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    The maximum Manhattan distance is 5
    between points $B$ and $C$:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.65]
    \draw[color=gray] (-1,-1) grid (4,4);

    \filldraw (0,2) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (3,3) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (1,0) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (3,1) circle (2.5pt);

    \node at (0,1.5) {$A$};
    \node at (3,2.5) {$C$};
    \node at (1,-0.5) {$B$};
    \node at (3,0.5) {$D$};

    \path[draw=red,thick,line width=2pt] (1,0) -- (1,3) -- (3,3);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    A useful technique related to Manhattan distances
    is to rotate all coordinates 45 degrees so that
    a point $(x,y)$ becomes $(x+y,y-x)$.
    For example, after rotating the above points,
    the result is:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]
    \draw[color=gray] (0,-3) grid (7,3);

    \filldraw (2,2) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (6,0) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (1,-1) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (4,-2) circle (2.5pt);

    \node at (2,1.5) {$A$};
    \node at (6,-0.5) {$C$};
    \node at (1,-1.5) {$B$};
    \node at (4,-2.5) {$D$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    And the maximum distance is as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]
    \draw[color=gray] (0,-3) grid (7,3);

    \filldraw (2,2) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (6,0) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (1,-1) circle (2.5pt);
    \filldraw (4,-2) circle (2.5pt);

    \node at (2,1.5) {$A$};
    \node at (6,-0.5) {$C$};
    \node at (1,-1.5) {$B$};
    \node at (4,-2.5) {$D$};

    \path[draw=red,thick,line width=2pt] (1,-1) -- (4,2) -- (6,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Consider two points $p_1=(x_1,y_1)$ and $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$ whose rotated
    coordinates are $p'_1=(x'_1,y'_1)$ and $p'_2=(x'_2,y'_2)$.
    Now there are two ways to express the Manhattan distance
    between $p_1$ and $p_2$:
    \[|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| = \max(|x'_1-x'_2|,|y'_1-y'_2|)\]

    For example, if $p_1=(1,0)$ and $p_2=(3,3)$,
    the rotated coordinates are $p'_1=(1,-1)$ and $p'_2=(6,0)$
    and the Manhattan distance is
    \[|1-3|+|0-3| = \max(|1-6|,|-1-0|) = 5.\]

    The rotated coordinates provide a simple way
    to operate with Manhattan distances, because we can
    consider x and y coordinates separately.
    To maximize the Manhattan distance between two points,
    we should find two points whose
    rotated coordinates maximize the value of
    \[\max(|x'_1-x'_2|,|y'_1-y'_2|).\]
    This is easy, because either the horizontal or vertical
    difference of the rotated coordinates has to be maximum.

    Title: Circle-Circle Intersection
    Part: 1/1
    # Circle-Circle Intersection

    You are given two circles on a 2D plane, each one described as coordinates of its center and its radius. Find the points of their intersection (possible cases: one or two points, no intersection or circles coincide).

    ## Solution

    Let's reduce this problem to the [circle-line intersection problem](circle-line-intersection.md).

    Assume without loss of generality that the first circle is centered at the origin (if this is not true, we can move the origin to the center of the first circle and adjust the coordinates of intersection points accordingly at output time). We have a system of two equations:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$(x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2$$

    Subtract the first equation from the second one to get rid of the second powers of variables:

    $$x^2+y^2=r_1^2$$

    $$x \cdot (-2x_2) + y \cdot (-2y_2) + (x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2) = 0$$

    Thus, we've reduced the original problem to the problem of finding intersections of the first circle and a line:

    $$Ax + By + C = 0$$

    $$\begin{align}
    A &= -2x_2 \\
    B &= -2y_2 \\
    C &= x_2^2+y_2^2+r_1^2-r_2^2
    \end{align}$$

    And this problem can be solved as described in the [corresponding article](circle-line-intersection.md).

    The only degenerate case we need to consider separately is when the centers of the circles coincide. In this case $x_2=y_2=0$, and the line equation will be $C = r_1^2-r_2^2 = 0$. If the radii of the circles are the same, there are infinitely many intersection points, if they differ, there are no intersections.
