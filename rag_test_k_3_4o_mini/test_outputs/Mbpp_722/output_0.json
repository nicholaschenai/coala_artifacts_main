    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary where each key is a student's name and the value is a tuple containing their height and weight. The function should filter this dictionary to return only those students whose height and weight are both above specified minimum values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   The function will iterate through each student in the dictionary. For each student, it will check if their height is greater than the minimum height and if their weight is greater than the minimum weight. If both conditions are met, the student will be included in the result. The final output will be a new dictionary containing only the students who meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function filter_data(students, min_height, min_weight):\n       create an empty dictionary for filtered students\n       for each student in students:\n           get the height and weight from the student's tuple\n           if height > min_height and weight > min_weight:\n               add student to the filtered dictionary\n       return the filtered dictionary\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef filter_data(students, min_height, min_weight):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store filtered students\n    filtered_students = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each student in the input dictionary\n    for student, (height, weight) in students.items():\n        # Check if both height and weight are above the minimum values\n        if height > min_height and weight > min_weight:\n            # If conditions are met, add the student to the filtered dictionary\n            filtered_students[student] = (height, weight)\n    \n    # Return the filtered dictionary\n    return filtered_students\n```",
