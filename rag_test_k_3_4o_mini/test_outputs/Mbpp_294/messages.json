It is required to find a subarray $a[l \\ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:\n\n    $$ \\max_{ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.\n    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\n    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.\n\n    ## Algorithm 1\n\n    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm is very simple.\n\n    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.\n\n    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \\ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.\n\n    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.\n\n    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.\n\n    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ \u2014 we will only need the current element from it.\n\n    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.\n\n    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        int cur = sum - min_sum;\n        if (cur > ans) {\n            ans = cur;\n            ans_l = min_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < min_sum) {\n            min_sum = sum;\n            min_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Algorithm 2\n\n    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.\n\n    **Proof:**\n\n    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum \u2014 so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.\n\n    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.\n\n    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a \"critical\" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \\ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.\n\n    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum);\n        sum = max(sum, 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        if (sum > ans) {\n            ans = sum;\n            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < 0) {\n            sum = 0;\n            minus_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Time complexity\n    Section: Maximum subarray sum\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Maximum subarray sum}\n\n    \\index{maximum subarray sum}\n\n    There are often several possible algorithms\n    for solving a problem such that their\n    time complexities are different.\n    This section discusses a classic problem that\n    has a straightforward $O(n^3)$ solution.\n    However, by designing a better algorithm, it\n    is possible to solve the problem in $O(n^2)$\n    time and even in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    Given an array of $n$ numbers,\n    our task is to calculate the\n    \\key{maximum subarray sum}, i.e.,\n    the largest possible sum of \n    a sequence of consecutive values\n    in the array\\footnote{J.

B. Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes\n    called \\index{Kadane's algorithm} \\key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means\n    that just one loop is enough.\n    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,\n    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.\n    After this, the answer for the problem is the\n    maximum of those sums.\n\n    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray\n    that ends at position $k$.\n    There are two possibilities:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.\n    \\item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends\n    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    In the latter case, since we want to\n    find a subarray with maximum sum,\n    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$\n    should also have the maximum sum.\n    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently\n    by calculating the maximum subarray sum\n    for each ending position from left to right.\n\n    The following code implements the algorithm:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int best = 0, sum = 0;\n    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);\n        best = max(best,sum);\n    }\n    cout << best << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The algorithm only contains one loop\n    that goes through the input,\n    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.\n    This is also the best possible time complexity,\n    because any algorithm for the problem\n    has to examine all array elements at least once.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    It is interesting to study how efficient \n    algorithms are in practice.\n    The following table shows the running times\n    of the above algorithms for different\n    values of $n$ on a modern computer.\n\n    In each test, the input was generated randomly.\n    The time needed for reading the input was not\n    measured.\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n    array size $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $10^2$ & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^3$ & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^4$ & > $10.0$ s & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^5$ & > $10.0$ s & $5.3$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^6$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    $10^7$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    The comparison shows that all algorithms\n    are efficient when the input size is small,\n    but larger inputs bring out remarkable\n    differences in the running times of the algorithms.\n    Algorithm 1 becomes slow\n    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2\n    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.\n    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process\n    even the largest inputs instantly.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Ternary Search\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Ternary Search\n\n    We are given a function $f(x)$ which is unimodal on an interval $[l, r]$. By unimodal function, we mean one of two behaviors of the function: \n\n    1. The function strictly increases first, reaches a maximum (at a single point or over an interval), and then strictly decreases.\n\n    2. The function strictly decreases first, reaches a minimum, and then strictly increases.\n\n    In this article, we will assume the first scenario.\n    The second scenario is completely symmetrical to the first.\n\n    The task is to find the maximum of function $f(x)$ on the interval $[l, r]$.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n\n    Consider any 2 points $m_1$, and $m_2$ in this interval: $l < m_1 < m_2 < r$. We evaluate the function at $m_1$ and $m_2$, i.e. find the values of $f(m_1)$ and $f(m_2)$. Now, we get one of three options:\n\n    -   $f(m_1) < f(m_2)$\n\n        The desired maximum can not be located on the left side of $m_1$, i.e. on the interval $[l, m_1]$, since either both points $m_1$ and $m_2$ or just $m_1$ belong to the area where the function increases. In either case, this means that we have to search for the maximum in the segment $[m_1, r]$.\n\n    -   $f(m_1) > f(m_2)$\n\n        This situation is symmetrical to the previous one: the maximum can not be located on the right side of $m_2$, i.e. on the interval $[m_2, r]$, and the search space is reduced to the segment $[l, m_2]$.\n\n    -   $f(m_1) = f(m_2)$\n\n        We can see that either both of these points belong to the area where the value of the function is maximized, or $m_1$ is in the area of increasing values and $m_2$ is in the area of descending values (here we used the strictness of function increasing/decreasing). Thus, the search space is reduced to $[m_1, m_2]$. To simplify the code, this case can be combined with any of the previous cases.\n\n    Thus, based on the comparison of the values in the two inner points, we can replace the current interval $[l, r]$ with a new, shorter interval $[l^\\prime, r^\\prime]$. Repeatedly applying the described procedure to the interval, we can get an arbitrarily short interval. Eventually, its length will be less than a certain pre-defined constant (accuracy), and the process can be stopped. This is a numerical method, so we can assume that after that the function reaches its maximum at all points of the last interval $[l, r]$. Without loss of generality, we can take $f(l)$ as the return value.\n\n    We didn't impose any restrictions on the choice of points $m_1$ and $m_2$. This choice will define the convergence rate and the accuracy of the implementation. The most common way is to choose the points so that they divide the interval $[l, r]$ into three equal parts. Thus, we have\n\n    $$m_1 = l + \\frac{(r - l)}{3}$$\n\n    $$m_2 = r - \\frac{(r - l)}{3}$$ \n\n    If $m_1$ and $m_2$ are chosen to be closer to each other, the convergence rate will increase slightly.\n\n    ### Run time analysis\n\n    $$T(n) = T({2n}/{3}) + 1 = \\Theta(\\log n)$$\n\n    It can be visualized as follows: every time after evaluating the function at points $m_1$ and $m_2$, we are essentially ignoring about one third of the interval, either the left or right one. Thus the size of the search space is ${2n}/{3}$ of the original one. \n\n    Applying [Master's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)), we get the desired complexity estimate.\n\n    ### The case of the integer arguments\n\n    If $f(x)$ takes integer parameter, the interval $[l, r]$ becomes discrete. Since we did not impose any restrictions on the choice of points $m_1$ and $m_2$, the correctness of the algorithm is not affected. $m_1$ and $m_2$ can still be chosen to divide $[l, r]$ into 3 approximately equal parts.\n\n    The difference occurs in the stopping criterion of the algorithm. Ternary search will have to stop when $(r - l) < 3$, because in that case we can no longer select $m_1$ and $m_2$ to be different from each other as well as from $l$ and $r$, and this can cause an infinite loop. Once $(r - l) < 3$, the remaining pool of candidate points $(l, l + 1, \\ldots, r)$ needs to be checked to find the point which produces the maximum value $f(x)$.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    ```cpp\n    double ternary_search(double l, double r) {\n    \tdouble eps = 1e-9;\t\t\t\t//set the error limit here\n    \twhile (r - l > eps) {\n    \t\tdouble m1 = l + (r - l) / 3;\n    \t\tdouble m2 = r - (r - l) / 3;\n    \t\tdouble f1 = f(m1);\t\t//evaluates the function at m1\n    \t\tdouble f2 = f(m2);\t\t//evaluates the function at m2\n    \t\tif (f1 < f2)\n    \t\t\tl = m1;\n    \t\telse\n    \t\t\tr = m2;\n    \t}\n    \treturn f(l);\t\t\t\t\t//return the maximum of f(x) in [l, r]\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Here `eps` is in fact the absolute error (not taking into account errors due to the inaccurate calculation of the function).\n\n    Instead of the criterion `r - l > eps`, we can select a constant number of iterations as a stopping criterion. The number of iterations should be chosen to ensure the required accuracy. Typically, in most programming challenges the error limit is ${10}^{-6}$ and thus 200 - 300 iterations are sufficient. Also, the number of iterations doesn't depend on the values of $l$ and $r$, so the number of iterations corresponds to the required relative error.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

If we encounter a non-integer, we will simply skip it.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_val(input_list):\n       initialize max_value to a very small number (or negative infinity)\n       for each element in input_list:\n           if element is an integer:\n               if element is greater than max_value:\n                   update max_value to element\n       return max_value\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef max_val(input_list):\n    # Initialize max_value to a very small number\n    max_value = float('-inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the input list\n    for element in input_list:\n        # Check if the element is an integer\n        if isinstance(element, int):\n            # Update max_value if the current element is greater\n            if element > max_value:\n                max_value = element\n    \n    # Return the maximum integer found, or a default value if none found\n    return max_value if max_value != float('-inf') else None\n```"
