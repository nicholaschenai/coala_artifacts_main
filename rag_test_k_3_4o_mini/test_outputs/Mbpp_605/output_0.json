    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that checks whether a given integer is a prime number. A prime number is defined as a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if a number is prime, we can check if it is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of the number. If we find any integer that divides the number evenly (i.e., with no remainder), then the number is not prime. If no such integer is found, the number is prime.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_prime(n):\n       if n < 2:\n           return False\n       for i from 2 to sqrt(n):\n           if n % i == 0:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    # Check if the number is less than 2, which are not prime\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    # Check for factors from 2 to the square root of n\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        # If n is divisible by i, then it is not prime\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    # If no divisors were found, n is prime\n    return True\n\n# The main function that will be called\ndef prime_num(n: int) -> bool:\n    return is_prime(n)\n```",
