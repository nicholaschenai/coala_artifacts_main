2$, and check if the equation holds or not.\n    If it doesn't hold, e.g. $a^{p-1} \\not\\equiv 1 \\bmod p$, we know that $p$ cannot be a prime number.\n    In this case we call the base $a$ a *Fermat witness* for the compositeness of $p$.\n\n    However it is also possible, that the equation holds for a composite number.\n    So if the equation holds, we don't have a proof for primality.\n    We only can say that $p$ is *probably prime*.\n    If it turns out that the number is actually composite, we call the base $a$ a *Fermat liar*.\n\n    By running the test for all possible bases $a$, we can actually prove that a number is prime.\n    However this is not done in practice, since this is a lot more effort that just doing *trial division*.\n    Instead the test will be repeated multiple times with random choices for $a$.\n    If we find no witness for the compositeness, it is very likely that the number is in fact prime.\n\n    ```cpp\n    bool probablyPrimeFermat(int n, int iter=5) {\n        if (n < 4)\n            return n == 2 || n == 3;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {\n            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);\n            if (binpower(a, n - 1, n) != 1)\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We use [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md) to efficiently compute the power $a^{p-1}$.\n\n    There is one bad news though:\n    there exist some composite numbers where $a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\bmod n$ holds for all $a$ coprime to $n$, for instance for the number $561 = 3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17$.\n    Such numbers are called *Carmichael numbers*.\n    The Fermat primality test can identify these numbers only, if we have immense luck and choose a base $a$ with $\\gcd(a, n) \\ne 1$.\n\n    The Fermat test is still be used in practice, as it is very fast and Carmichael numbers are very rare.\n    E.g. there only exist 646 such numbers below $10^9$.\n\n    ## Miller-Rabin primality test\n\n    The Miller-Rabin test extends the ideas from the Fermat test.\n\n    For an odd number $n$, $n-1$ is even and we can factor out all powers of 2.\n    We can write:\n\n    $$n - 1 = 2^s \\cdot d,~\\text{with}~d~\\text{odd}.$$\n\n    This allows us to factorize the equation of Fermat's little theorem:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{rl}\n    a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\bmod n &\\Longleftrightarrow a^{2^s d} - 1 \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    &\\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-1} d} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    &\\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    &\\quad\\vdots \\\\\\\\\n    &\\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) \\cdots (a^{d} + 1) (a^{d} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    If $n$ is prime, then $n$ has to divide one of these factors.\n    And in the Miller-Rabin primality test we check exactly that statement, which is a more stricter version of the statement of the Fermat test.\n    For a base $2 \\le a \\le n-2$ we check if either\n\n    $$a^d \\equiv 1 \\bmod n$$\n\n    holds or\n\n    $$a^{2^r d} \\equiv -1 \\bmod n$$\n\n    holds for some $0 \\le r \\le s - 1$.\n\n    If we found a base $a$ which doesn't satisfy any of the above equalities, than we found a *witness* for the compositeness of $n$.\n    In this case we have proven that $n$ is not a prime number.\n\n    Similar to the Fermat test, it is also possible that the set of equations is satisfied for a composite number.\n    In that case the base $a$ is called a *strong liar*.\n    If a base $a$ satisfies the equations (one of them), $n$ is only *strong probable prime*.\n    However, there are no numbers like the Carmichael numbers, where all non-trivial bases lie.\n    In fact it is possible to show, that at most $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the bases can be strong liars.\n    If $n$ is composite, we have a probability of $\\ge 75\\%$ that a random base will tell us that it is composite.\n    By doing multiple iterations, choosing different random bases, we can tell with very high probability if the number is truly prime or if it is composite.\n\n    Here is an implementation for 64 bit integer.\n\n    ```cpp\n    using u64 = uint64_t;\n    using u128 = __uint128_t;\n\n    u64 binpower(u64 base, u64 e, u64 mod) {\n        u64 result = 1;\n        base %= mod;\n        while (e) {\n            if (e & 1)\n                result = (u128)result * base % mod;\n            base = (u128)base * base % mod;\n            e >>= 1;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    bool check_composite(u64 n, u64 a, u64 d, int s) {\n        u64 x = binpower(a, d, n);\n        if (x == 1 || x == n - 1)\n            return false;\n        for (int r = 1; r < s; r++) {\n            x = (u128)x * x % n;\n            if (x == n - 1)\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    };\n\n    bool MillerRabin(u64 n, int iter=5) { // returns true if n is probably prime, else returns false.\n        if (n < 4)\n            return n == 2 || n == 3;\n\n        int s = 0;\n        u64 d = n - 1;\n        while ((d & 1) == 0) {\n            d >>= 1;\n            s++;\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {\n            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);\n            if (check_composite(n, a, d, s))\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Before the Miller-Rabin test you can test additionally if one of the first few prime numbers is a divisor.\n    This can speed up the test by a lot, since most composite numbers have very small prime divisors.\n    E.g. $88\\%$ of all numbers have a prime factors smaller than $100$.\n\n    ### Deterministic version\n\n    Miller showed that it is possible to make the algorithm deterministic by only checking all bases $\\le O((\\ln n)^2)$.\n    Bach later gave a concrete bound, it is only necessary to test all bases $a \\le 2 \\ln(n)^2$.\n\n    This is still a pretty large number of bases.\n    So people have invested quite a lot of computation power into finding lower bounds.\n    It turns out, for testing a 32 bit integer it is only necessary to check the first 4 prime bases: 2, 3, 5 and 7.\n    The smallest composite number that fails this test is $3,215,031,751 = 151 \\cdot 751 \\cdot 28351$.\n    And for testing 64 bit integer it is enough to check the first 12 prime bases: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.\n\n    This results in the following deterministic implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    bool MillerRabin(u64 n) { // returns true if n is prime, else returns false.\n        if (n < 2)\n            return false;\n\n        int r = 0;\n        u64 d = n - 1;\n        while ((d & 1) == 0) {\n            d >>= 1;\n            r++;\n        }\n\n        for (int a : {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37}) {\n            if (n == a)\n                return true;\n            if (check_composite(n, a, d, r))\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Number theory\n    Section: Primes and factors\n    Part: 1/2\n    \\chapter{Number theory}\n\n    \\index{number theory}\n\n    \\key{Number theory} is a branch of mathematics\n    that studies integers.\n    Number theory is a fascinating field,\n    because many questions involving integers\n    are very difficult to solve even if they\n    seem simple at first glance.\n\n    As an example, consider the following equation:\n    \\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 33\\]\n    It is easy to find three real numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$\n    that satisfy the equation.\n    For example, we can choose\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    x = 3, \\\\\n    y = \\sqrt[3]{3}, \\\\\n    z = \\sqrt[3]{3}.\\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n    However, it is an open problem in number theory\n    if there are any three\n    \\emph{integers} $x$, $y$ and $z$\n    that would satisfy the equation \\cite{bec07}.\n\n    In this chapter, we will focus on basic concepts\n    and algorithms in number theory.\n    Throughout the chapter, we will assume that all numbers\n    are integers, if not otherwise stated.\n\n    \\section{Primes and factors}\n\n    \\index{divisibility}\n    \\index{factor}\n    \\index{divisor}\n\n    A number $a$ is called a \\key{factor} or a \\key{divisor} of a number $b$\n    if $a$ divides $b$.\n    If $a$ is a factor of $b$,\n    we write $a \\mid b$, and otherwise we write $a \\nmid b$.\n    For example, the factors of 24 are\n    1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24.\n\n    \\index{prime}\n    \\index{prime decomposition}\n\n    A number $n>1$ is a \\key{prime}\n    if its only positive factors are 1 and $n$.\n    For example, 7, 19 and 41 are primes,\n    but 35 is not a prime, because $5 \\cdot 7 = 35$.\n    For every number $n>1$, there is a unique\n    \\key{prime factorization}\n    \\[ n = p_1^{\\alpha_1} p_2^{\\alpha_2} \\cdots p_k^{\\alpha_k},\\]\n    where $p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$ are distinct primes and\n    $\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\ldots,\\alpha_k$ are positive numbers.\n    For example, the prime factorization for 84 is\n    \\[84 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 7^1.\\]\n\n    The \\key{number of factors} of a number $n$ is\n    \\[\\tau(n)=\\prod_{i=1}^k (\\alpha_i+1),\\]\n    because for each prime $p_i$, there are\n    $\\alpha_i+1$ ways to choose how many times\n    it appears in the factor.\n    For example, the number of factors\n    of 84 is\n    $\\tau(84)=3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 12$.\n    The factors are\n    1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42 and 84.\n\n    The \\key{sum of factors} of $n$ is\n    \\[\\sigma(n)=\\prod_{i=1}^k (1+p_i+\\ldots+p_i^{\\alpha_i}) = \\prod_{i=1}^k \\frac{p_i^{a_i+1}-1}{p_i-1},\\]\n    where the latter formula is based on the geometric progression formula.\n    For example, the sum of factors of 84 is\n    \\[\\sigma(84)=\\frac{2^3-1}{2-1} \\cdot \\frac{3^2-1}{3-1} \\cdot \\frac{7^2-1}{7-1} = 7 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 8 = 224.\\]\n\n    The \\key{product of factors} of $n$ is\n    \\[\\mu(n)=n^{\\tau(n)/2},\\]\n    because we can form $\\tau(n)/2$ pairs from the factors,\n    each with product $n$.\n    For example, the factors of 84\n    produce the pairs\n    $1 \\cdot 84$, $2 \\cdot 42$, $3 \\cdot 28$, etc.,\n    and the product of the factors is $\\mu(84)=84^6=351298031616$.\n\n    \\index{perfect number}\n\n    A number $n$ is called a \\key{perfect number} if $n=\\sigma(n)-n$,\n    i.e., $n$ equals the sum of its factors\n    between $1$ and $n-1$.\n    For example, 28 is a perfect number,\n    because $28=1+2+4+7+14$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Number of primes}\n\n    It is easy to show that there is an infinite number\n    of primes.\n    If the number of primes would be finite,\n    we could construct a set $P=\\{p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n\\}$\n    that would contain all the primes.\n    For example, $p_1=2$, $p_2=3$, $p_3=5$, and so on.\n    However, using $P$, we could form a new prime\n    \\[p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_n+1\\]\n    that is larger than all elements in $P$.\n    This is a contradiction, and the number of primes\n    has to be infinite.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Density of primes}\n\n    The density of primes means how often there are primes\n    among the numbers.\n    Let $\\pi(n)$ denote the number of primes between\n    $1$ and $n$. For example, $\\pi(10)=4$, because\n    there are 4 primes between $1$ and $10$: 2, 3, 5 and 7.\n\n    It is possible to show that\n    \\[\\pi(n) \\approx \\frac{n}{\\ln n},\\]\n    which means that primes are quite frequent.\n    For example, the number of primes between\n    $1$ and $10^6$ is $\\pi(10^6)=78498$,\n    and $10^6 / \\ln 10^6 \\approx 72382$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Conjectures}\n\n    There are many \\emph{conjectures} involving primes.\n    Most people think that the conjectures are true,\n    but nobody has been able to prove them.\n    For example, the following conjectures are famous:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\index{Goldbach's conjecture}\n    \\item \\key{Goldbach's conjecture}:\n    Each even integer $n>2$ can be represented as a\n    sum $n=a+b$ so that both $a$ and $b$ are primes.\n    \\index{twin prime}\n    \\item \\key{Twin prime conjecture}:\n    There is an infinite number of pairs\n    of the form $\\{p,p+2\\}$,\n    where both $p$ and $p+2$ are primes.\n    \\index{Legendre's conjecture}\n    \\item \\key{Legendre's conjecture}:\n    There is always a prime between numbers\n    $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$, where $n$ is any positive integer.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    \\subsubsection{Basic algorithms}\n\n    If a number $n$ is not prime,\n    it can be represented as a product $a \\cdot b$,\n    where $a \\le \\sqrt n$ or $b \\le \\sqrt n$,\n    so it certainly has a factor between $2$ and $\\lfloor \\sqrt n \\rfloor$.\n    Using this observation, we can both test\n    if a number is prime and find the prime factorization\n    of a number in $O(\\sqrt n)$ time.\n\n    The following function \\texttt{prime} checks\n    if the given number $n$ is prime.\n    The function attempts to divide $n$ by\n    all numbers between $2$ and $\\lfloor \\sqrt n \\rfloor$,\n    and if none of them divides $n$, then $n$ is prime.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    bool prime(int n) {\n        if (n < 2) return false;\n        for (int x = 2; x*x <= n; x++) {\n            if (n%x == 0) return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    \\noindent\n    The following function \\texttt{factors}\n    constructs a vector that contains the prime\n    factorization of $n$.\n    The function divides $n$ by its prime factors,\n    and adds them to the vector.\n    The process ends when the remaining number $n$\n    has no factors between $2$ and $\\lfloor \\sqrt n \\rfloor$.\n    If $n>1$, it is prime and the last factor.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    vector<int> factors(int n) {\n        vector<int> f;\n        for (int x = 2;
