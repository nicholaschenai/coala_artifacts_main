Pick's theorem provides a way to compute the area of this polygon through the number of vertices that are lying on the boundary and the number of vertices that lie strictly inside the polygon.\n\n    ## Formula\n\n    Given a certain lattice polygon with non-zero area.\n\n    We denote its area by $S$, the number of points with integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon by $I$ and the number of points lying on polygon sides by $B$.\n\n    Then, the **Pick's formula** states:\n\n    $$S=I+\\frac{B}{2}-1$$\n\n    In particular, if the values of $I$ and $B$ for a polygon are given, the area can be calculated in $O(1)$ without even knowing the vertices.\n\n    This formula was discovered and proven by Austrian mathematician Georg Alexander Pick in 1899.\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    The proof is carried out in many stages: from simple polygons to arbitrary ones:\n\n    - A single square: $S=1, I=0, B=4$, which satisfies the formula.\n\n    - An arbitrary non-degenerate rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes: Assume $a$ and $b$ be the length of the sides of rectangle. Then, $S=ab, I=(a-1)(b-1), B=2(a+b)$. On substituting, we see that formula is true.\n\n    - A right angle with legs parallel to the axes: To prove this, note that any such triangle can be obtained by cutting off a rectangle by a diagonal. Denoting the number of integral points lying on diagonal by $c$, it can be shown that Pick's formula holds for this triangle regardless of $c$.\n\n    - An arbitrary triangle: Note that any such triangle can be turned into a rectangle by attaching it to sides of right-angled triangles with legs parallel to the axes (you will not need more than 3 such triangles). From here, we can get correct formula for any triangle.\n\n    - An arbitrary polygon: To prove this, triangulate it, ie, divide into triangles with integral coordinates. Further, it is possible to prove that Pick's theorem retains its validity when a polygon is added to a triangle. Thus, we have proven Pick's formula for arbitrary polygon.\n\n    ## Generalization to higher dimensions\n\n    Unfortunately, this simple and beautiful formula cannot be generalized to higher dimensions.\n\n    John Reeve demonstrated this by proposing a tetrahedron (**Reeve tetrahedron**) with following vertices in 1957:\n\n    $$A=(0,0,0),\n    B=(1,0,0),\n    C=(0,1,0),\n    D=(1,1,k),$$\n\n    where $k$ can be any natural number. Then for any $k$, the tetrahedron $ABCD$ does not contain integer point inside it and has only $4$ points on its borders, $A, B, C, D$. Thus, the volume and surface area may vary in spite of unchanged number of points within and on boundary. Therefore, Pick's theorem doesn't allow generalizations.\n\n    However, higher dimensions still has a generalization using **Ehrhart polynomials** but they are quite complex and depends not only on points inside but also on the boundary of polytype.\n\n    ## Extra Resources\n    A few simple examples and a simple proof of Pick's theorem can be found [here](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/pick.pdf).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

Pick's theorem provides a way to compute the area of this polygon through the number of vertices that are lying on the boundary and the number of vertices that lie strictly inside the polygon.\n\n    ## Formula\n\n    Given a certain lattice polygon with non-zero area.\n\n    We denote its area by $S$, the number of points with integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon by $I$ and the number of points lying on polygon sides by $B$.\n\n    Then, the **Pick's formula** states:\n\n    $$S=I+\\frac{B}{2}-1$$\n\n    In particular, if the values of $I$ and $B$ for a polygon are given, the area can be calculated in $O(1)$ without even knowing the vertices.\n\n    This formula was discovered and proven by Austrian mathematician Georg Alexander Pick in 1899.\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    The proof is carried out in many stages: from simple polygons to arbitrary ones:\n\n    - A single square: $S=1, I=0, B=4$, which satisfies the formula.\n\n    - An arbitrary non-degenerate rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes: Assume $a$ and $b$ be the length of the sides of rectangle. Then, $S=ab, I=(a-1)(b-1), B=2(a+b)$. On substituting, we see that formula is true.\n\n    - A right angle with legs parallel to the axes: To prove this, note that any such triangle can be obtained by cutting off a rectangle by a diagonal. Denoting the number of integral points lying on diagonal by $c$, it can be shown that Pick's formula holds for this triangle regardless of $c$.\n\n    - An arbitrary triangle: Note that any such triangle can be turned into a rectangle by attaching it to sides of right-angled triangles with legs parallel to the axes (you will not need more than 3 such triangles). From here, we can get correct formula for any triangle.\n\n    - An arbitrary polygon: To prove this, triangulate it, ie, divide into triangles with integral coordinates. Further, it is possible to prove that Pick's theorem retains its validity when a polygon is added to a triangle. Thus, we have proven Pick's formula for arbitrary polygon.\n\n    ## Generalization to higher dimensions\n\n    Unfortunately, this simple and beautiful formula cannot be generalized to higher dimensions.\n\n    John Reeve demonstrated this by proposing a tetrahedron (**Reeve tetrahedron**) with following vertices in 1957:\n\n    $$A=(0,0,0),\n    B=(1,0,0),\n    C=(0,1,0),\n    D=(1,1,k),$$\n\n    where $k$ can be any natural number. Then for any $k$, the tetrahedron $ABCD$ does not contain integer point inside it and has only $4$ points on its borders, $A, B, C, D$. Thus, the volume and surface area may vary in spite of unchanged number of points within and on boundary. Therefore, Pick's theorem doesn't allow generalizations.\n\n    However, higher dimensions still has a generalization using **Ehrhart polynomials** but they are quite complex and depends not only on points inside but also on the boundary of polytype.\n\n    ## Extra Resources\n    A few simple examples and a simple proof of Pick's theorem can be found [here](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/pick.pdf).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Geometry\n    Section: Polygon area\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Polygon area}\n\n    A general formula for calculating the area\n    of a polygon, sometimes called the \\key{shoelace formula},\n    is as follows: \\index{shoelace formula}\n    \\[\\frac{1}{2} |\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (p_i \\times p_{i+1})| =\n    \\frac{1}{2} |\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|, \\]\n    Here the vertices are\n    $p_1=(x_1,y_1)$, $p_2=(x_2,y_2)$, $\\ldots$, $p_n=(x_n,y_n)$\n    in such an order that\n    $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ are adjacent vertices on the boundary\n    of the polygon,\n    and the first and last vertex is the same, i.e., $p_1=p_n$.\n\n    For example, the area of the polygon\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};\n    \\node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};\n    \\node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};\n    \\node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};\n    \\node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};\n    \\path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    is\n    \\[\\frac{|(2\\cdot5-5\\cdot4)+(5\\cdot3-7\\cdot5)+(7\\cdot1-4\\cdot3)+(4\\cdot3-4\\cdot1)+(4\\cdot4-2\\cdot3)|}{2} = 17/2.\\]\n\n    The idea of the formula is to go through trapezoids\n    whose one side is a side of the polygon,\n    and another side lies on the horizontal line $y=0$.\n    For example:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\path[draw,fill=lightgray] (5,5.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (7,0) -- (5,0) -- (5,5.4);\n    \\filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};\n    \\node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};\n    \\node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};\n    \\node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};\n    \\node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};\n    \\path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);\n    \\draw (0,0) -- (10,0);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    The area of such a trapezoid is\n    \\[(x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \\frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2},\\]\n    where the vertices of the polygon are $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$.\n    If $x_{i+1}>x_{i}$, the area is positive,\n    and if $x_{i+1}<x_{i}$, the area is negative.\n\n    The area of the polygon is the sum of areas of\n    all such trapezoids, which yields the formula\n    \\[|\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_{i+1}-x_{i}) \\frac{y_i+y_{i+1}}{2}| =\n    \\frac{1}{2} |\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|.\\]\n\n    Note that the absolute value of the sum is taken,\n    because the value of the sum may be positive or negative,\n    depending on whether we walk clockwise or counterclockwise\n    along the boundary of the polygon.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Pick's theorem}\n\n    \\index{Pick's theorem}\n\n    \\key{Pick's theorem} provides another way to calculate\n    the area of a polygon provided that all vertices \n    of the polygon have integer coordinates.\n    According to Pick's theorem, the area of the polygon is\n    \\[ a + b/2 -1,\\]\n    where $a$ is the number of integer points inside the polygon\n    and $b$ is the number of integer points on the boundary of the polygon.\n\n    For example, the area of the polygon\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\filldraw (4,1.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (5,5.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\node (1) at (4,1) {(4,1)};\n    \\node (2) at (7.2,3) {(7,3)};\n    \\node (3) at (5,5.8) {(5,5)};\n    \\node (4) at (2,4) {(2,4)};\n    \\node (5) at (3.5,3) {(4,3)};\n    \\path[draw] (4,1.4) -- (7,3.4) -- (5,5.4) -- (2,4.4) -- (4,3.4) -- (4,1.4);\n\n    \\filldraw (2,4.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (3,4.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (4,4.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (5,4.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (6,4.4) circle (2pt);\n\n    \\filldraw (4,3.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (5,3.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (6,3.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (7,3.4) circle (2pt);\n\n    \\filldraw (4,2.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\filldraw (5,2.4) circle (2pt);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    is $6+7/2-1=17/2$.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

y_1 x_2|$.\n    Another way to obtain the same result is to multiply $|\\mathbf a|$ (base of parallelogram) with the height, which is the projection of vector $\\mathbf b$ onto vector $\\mathbf a$ rotated by $90^\\circ$ which in turn is $\\widehat{\\mathbf a}=(-y_1;x_1)$.\n    That is, to calculate $|\\widehat{\\mathbf a}\\cdot\\mathbf b|=|x_1y_2 - y_1 x_2|$. \n\n    If we will take the sign into consideration then the area will be positive if the rotation from $\\mathbf a$ to $\\mathbf b$ (i.e. from the view of the point of $\\mathbf e_z$) is performed counter-clockwise and negative otherwise.\n    That defines the pseudo-scalar product.\n    Note that it also equals $|\\mathbf a| \\cdot |\\mathbf b| \\sin \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is angle from $\\mathbf a$ to $\\mathbf b$ count counter-clockwise (and negative if rotation is clockwise).\n\n    Let's implement all this stuff!\n\n    ```{.cpp file=crossproduct}\n    point3d cross(point3d a, point3d b) {\n        return point3d(a.y * b.z -

Pick's theorem provides a way to compute the area of this polygon through the number of vertices that are lying on the boundary and the number of vertices that lie strictly inside the polygon.\n\n    ## Formula\n\n    Given a certain lattice polygon with non-zero area.\n\n    We denote its area by $S$, the number of points with integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon by $I$ and the number of points lying on polygon sides by $B$.\n\n    Then, the **Pick's formula** states:\n\n    $$S=I+\\frac{B}{2}-1$$\n\n    In particular, if the values of $I$ and $B$ for a polygon are given, the area can be calculated in $O(1)$ without even knowing the vertices.\n\n    This formula was discovered and proven by Austrian mathematician Georg Alexander Pick in 1899.\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    The proof is carried out in many stages: from simple polygons to arbitrary ones:\n\n    - A single square: $S=1, I=0, B=4$, which satisfies the formula.\n\n    - An arbitrary non-degenerate rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes: Assume $a$ and $b$ be the length of the sides of rectangle. Then, $S=ab, I=(a-1)(b-1), B=2(a+b)$. On substituting, we see that formula is true.\n\n    - A right angle with legs parallel to the axes: To prove this, note that any such triangle can be obtained by cutting off a rectangle by a diagonal. Denoting the number of integral points lying on diagonal by $c$, it can be shown that Pick's formula holds for this triangle regardless of $c$.\n\n    - An arbitrary triangle: Note that any such triangle can be turned into a rectangle by attaching it to sides of right-angled triangles with legs parallel to the axes (you will not need more than 3 such triangles). From here, we can get correct formula for any triangle.\n\n    - An arbitrary polygon: To prove this, triangulate it, ie, divide into triangles with integral coordinates. Further, it is possible to prove that Pick's theorem retains its validity when a polygon is added to a triangle. Thus, we have proven Pick's formula for arbitrary polygon.\n\n    ## Generalization to higher dimensions\n\n    Unfortunately, this simple and beautiful formula cannot be generalized to higher dimensions.\n\n    John Reeve demonstrated this by proposing a tetrahedron (**Reeve tetrahedron**) with following vertices in 1957:\n\n    $$A=(0,0,0),\n    B=(1,0,0),\n    C=(0,1,0),\n    D=(1,1,k),$$\n\n    where $k$ can be any natural number. Then for any $k$, the tetrahedron $ABCD$ does not contain integer point inside it and has only $4$ points on its borders, $A, B, C, D$. Thus, the volume and surface area may vary in spite of unchanged number of points within and on boundary. Therefore, Pick's theorem doesn't allow generalizations.\n\n    However, higher dimensions still has a generalization using **Ehrhart polynomials** but they are quite complex and depends not only on points inside but also on the boundary of polytype.\n\n    ## Extra Resources\n    A few simple examples and a simple proof of Pick's theorem can be found [here](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/pick.pdf).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

\\mathbf r_2)=0$ for all vectors $\\mathbf a$ which is possible only when $\\mathbf r_1 = \\mathbf r_2$.\n    4.  $\\mathbf a\\cdot (\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf b\\cdot (\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf a) = -\\mathbf a\\cdot( \\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf b)$\n    5.  $(\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c = \\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$.\n        Indeed for all vectors $\\mathbf r$ the chain of equations holds:\n\n        \\[\\mathbf r\\cdot( (\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c) = (\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b) \\cdot (\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) =  \\mathbf a \\cdot(\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) + \\mathbf b\\cdot(\\mathbf c\\times \\mathbf r) = \\mathbf r\\cdot (\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c) + \\mathbf r\\cdot(\\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c) = \\mathbf r\\cdot(\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c)\\]\n\n        Which proves $(\\mathbf a + \\mathbf b)\\times \\mathbf c = \\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf c + \\mathbf b\\times \\mathbf c$ due to point 3.\n\n    6.  $|\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b|=|\\mathbf a| \\cdot |\\mathbf b| \\sin \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is angle between $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$, since $|\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b|$ equals to the area of the parallelogram formed by $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$. \n\n    Given all this and that the following equation holds for the unit vectors\n\n    $$\\mathbf e_x\\times \\mathbf e_x = \\mathbf e_y\\times \\mathbf e_y = \\mathbf e_z\\times \\mathbf e_z = \\mathbf 0,\\\\\n    \\mathbf e_x\\times \\mathbf e_y = \\mathbf e_z,~\\mathbf e_y\\times \\mathbf e_z = \\mathbf e_x,~\\mathbf e_z\\times \\mathbf e_x = \\mathbf e_y$$\n\n    we can calculate the cross product of $\\mathbf a = (x_1;y_1;z_1)$ and $\\mathbf b = (x_2;y_2;z_2)$ in coordinate form:\n\n    $$\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b = (x_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_x + y_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_y + z_1 \\cdot \\mathbf e_z)\\times (x_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_x + y_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_y + z_2 \\cdot \\mathbf e_z) =$$\n\n    $$(y_1 z_2 - z_1 y_2)\\mathbf e_x  + (z_1 x_2 - x_1 z_2)\\mathbf e_y + (x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2)$$\n\n    Which also can be written in the more elegant form:\n\n    $$\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b = \\begin{vmatrix}\\mathbf e_x & \\mathbf e_y & \\mathbf e_z \\\\ x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\end{vmatrix},~a\\cdot(b\\times c) = \\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 & z_3 \\end{vmatrix}$$\n\n    Here $| \\cdot |$ stands for the determinant of a matrix. \n\n    Some kind of cross product (namely the pseudo-scalar product) can also be implemented in the 2D case.\n    If we would like to calculate the area of parallelogram formed by vectors $\\mathbf a$ and $\\mathbf b$ we would compute $|\\mathbf e_z\\cdot(\\mathbf a\\times \\mathbf b)| = |x_1 y_2 - y_1 x_2|$.\n    Another way to obtain the same result is to multiply $|\\mathbf a|$ (base of parallelogram) with the height, which is the projection of vector $\\mathbf b$ onto vector $\\mathbf a$ rotated by $90^\\circ$ which in turn is $\\widehat{\\mathbf a}=(-y_1;x_1)$.\n    That is, to calculate $|\\widehat{\\mathbf a}\\cdot\\mathbf b|=|x_1y_2 - y_1 x_2|$. \n\n    If we will take the sign into consideration then the area will be positive if the rotation from $\\mathbf a$ to $\\mathbf b$ (i.e. from the view of the point of $\\mathbf e_z$) is performed counter-clockwise and negative otherwise.\n    That defines the pseudo-scalar product.\n    Note that it also equals $|\\mathbf a| \\cdot |\\mathbf b| \\sin \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is angle from $\\mathbf a$ to $\\mathbf b$ count counter-clockwise (and negative if rotation is clockwise).\n\n    Let's implement all this stuff!\n\n    ```{.cpp file=crossproduct}\n    point3d cross(point3d a, point3d b) {\n        return point3d(a.y * b.z -

Pick's theorem provides a way to compute the area of this polygon through the number of vertices that are lying on the boundary and the number of vertices that lie strictly inside the polygon.\n\n    ## Formula\n\n    Given a certain lattice polygon with non-zero area.\n\n    We denote its area by $S$, the number of points with integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon by $I$ and the number of points lying on polygon sides by $B$.\n\n    Then, the **Pick's formula** states:\n\n    $$S=I+\\frac{B}{2}-1$$\n\n    In particular, if the values of $I$ and $B$ for a polygon are given, the area can be calculated in $O(1)$ without even knowing the vertices.\n\n    This formula was discovered and proven by Austrian mathematician Georg Alexander Pick in 1899.\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    The proof is carried out in many stages: from simple polygons to arbitrary ones:\n\n    - A single square: $S=1, I=0, B=4$, which satisfies the formula.\n\n    - An arbitrary non-degenerate rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes: Assume $a$ and $b$ be the length of the sides of rectangle. Then, $S=ab, I=(a-1)(b-1), B=2(a+b)$. On substituting, we see that formula is true.\n\n    - A right angle with legs parallel to the axes: To prove this, note that any such triangle can be obtained by cutting off a rectangle by a diagonal. Denoting the number of integral points lying on diagonal by $c$, it can be shown that Pick's formula holds for this triangle regardless of $c$.\n\n    - An arbitrary triangle: Note that any such triangle can be turned into a rectangle by attaching it to sides of right-angled triangles with legs parallel to the axes (you will not need more than 3 such triangles). From here, we can get correct formula for any triangle.\n\n    - An arbitrary polygon: To prove this, triangulate it, ie, divide into triangles with integral coordinates. Further, it is possible to prove that Pick's theorem retains its validity when a polygon is added to a triangle. Thus, we have proven Pick's formula for arbitrary polygon.\n\n    ## Generalization to higher dimensions\n\n    Unfortunately, this simple and beautiful formula cannot be generalized to higher dimensions.\n\n    John Reeve demonstrated this by proposing a tetrahedron (**Reeve tetrahedron**) with following vertices in 1957:\n\n    $$A=(0,0,0),\n    B=(1,0,0),\n    C=(0,1,0),\n    D=(1,1,k),$$\n\n    where $k$ can be any natural number. Then for any $k$, the tetrahedron $ABCD$ does not contain integer point inside it and has only $4$ points on its borders, $A, B, C, D$. Thus, the volume and surface area may vary in spite of unchanged number of points within and on boundary. Therefore, Pick's theorem doesn't allow generalizations.\n\n    However, higher dimensions still has a generalization using **Ehrhart polynomials** but they are quite complex and depends not only on points inside but also on the boundary of polytype.\n\n    ## Extra Resources\n    A few simple examples and a simple proof of Pick's theorem can be found [here](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/pick.pdf).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
