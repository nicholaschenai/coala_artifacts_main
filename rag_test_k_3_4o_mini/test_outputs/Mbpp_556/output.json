    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many pairs of numbers in a given list have an XOR value that is odd. The function should take a list of integers and an integer representing the length of the list as input and return the count of such pairs.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   To determine if the XOR of two numbers is odd, we can use the property that the XOR of two numbers is odd if one number is even and the other is odd. Therefore, we can count the number of even and odd numbers in the list. The number of valid pairs can then be calculated by multiplying the count of even numbers by the count of odd numbers.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):\n       count_even = 0\n       count_odd = 0\n       \n       for each number in arr:\n           if number is even:\n               increment count_even\n           else:\n               increment count_odd\n       \n       return count_even * count_odd\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef count_even_odd(arr):\n    count_even = 0\n    count_odd = 0\n    \n    for number in arr:\n        if number % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even\n            count_even += 1\n        else:\n            count_odd += 1  # Otherwise, it's odd\n    \n    return count_even, count_odd\n\ndef find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):\n    count_even, count_odd = count_even_odd(arr)  # Get counts of even and odd numbers\n    return count_even * count_odd  # Return the product of counts\n```",
