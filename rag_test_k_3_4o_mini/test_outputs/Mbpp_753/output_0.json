    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a number. The function should return the smallest `k` records based on the numerical values in the tuples, sorted in ascending order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Sort the list of tuples based on the numerical values in each tuple.\n   - Select the first `k` tuples from the sorted list, as these will represent the minimum `k` records.\n   - Return the selected tuples.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function min_k(records, k):\n       sort records by the second element of each tuple\n       return the first k elements of the sorted records\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef min_k(records, k):\n    # Step 1: Sort the records based on the second element of each tuple (the number)\n    sorted_records = sorted(records, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    \n    # Step 2: Select the first k elements from the sorted list\n    return sorted_records[:k]\n\n# The function min_k is declared last as per the instructions.\n```",
