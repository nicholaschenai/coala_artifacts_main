    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a Python function that checks if two given integers have opposite signs. If one integer is positive and the other is negative, the function should return `True`. If both integers are either positive or negative, or if one or both are zero, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To determine if two integers have opposite signs, we can use the property of multiplication. If the product of the two integers is negative, it indicates that one is positive and the other is negative. If the product is zero or positive, they either have the same sign or one of them is zero.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function opposite_Signs(a, b):\n       if a * b < 0:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef opposite_Signs(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the product of a and b is negative\n    if a * b < 0:\n        return True  # They have opposite signs\n    else:\n        return False  # They do not have opposite signs\n```",
