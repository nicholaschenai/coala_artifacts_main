If they have opposite signs, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if two integers have opposite signs, we can check the product of the two integers. If the product is less than zero, it means one integer is positive and the other is negative. If the product is zero or greater, they either have the same sign or one of them is zero.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:

    Title: Linear Diophantine Equation
    Part: 1/2
    # Linear Diophantine Equation

    A Linear Diophantine Equation (in two variables) is an equation of the general form:

    $$ax + by = c$$

    where $a$, $b$, $c$ are given integers, and $x$, $y$ are unknown integers.

    In this article, we consider several classical problems on these equations:

    * finding one solution
    * finding all solutions
    * finding the number of solutions and the solutions themselves in a given interval
    * finding a solution with minimum value of $x + y$

    ## The degenerate case

    A degenerate case that need to be taken care of is when $a = b = 0$. It is easy to see that we either have no solutions or infinitely many solutions, depending on whether $c = 0$ or not. In the rest of this article, we will ignore this case.

    ## Analytic solution

    When $a \neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$, the equation $ax+by=c$ can be equivalently treated as either of the following:

    \begin{gather}
    ax \equiv c \pmod b,\newline
    by \equiv c \pmod a.
    \end{gather}

    Without loss of generality, assume that $b \neq 0$ and consider the first equation. When $a$ and $b$ are co-prime, the solution to it is given as

    $$x \equiv ca^{-1} \pmod b,$$

    where $a^{-1}$ is the [modular inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$ modulo $b$.

    When $a$ and $b$ are not co-prime, values of $ax$ modulo $b$ for all integer $x$ are divisible by $g=\gcd(a, b)$, so the solution only exists when $c$ is divisible by $g$. In this case, one of solutions can be found by reducing the equation by $g$:

    $$(a/g) x \equiv (c/g) \pmod{b/g}.$$

    By the definition of $g$, the numbers $a/g$ and $b/g$ are co-prime, so the solution is given explicitly as

    $$\begin{cases}
    x \equiv (c/g)(a/g)^{-1}\pmod{b/g},\\
    y = \frac{c-ax}{b}.
    \end{cases}$$

    ## Algorithmic solution

    To find one solution of the Diophantine equation with 2 unknowns, you can use the [Extended Euclidean algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md). First, assume that $a$ and $b$ are non-negative. When we apply Extended Euclidean algorithm for $a$ and $b$, we can find their greatest common divisor $g$ and 2 numbers $x_g$ and $y_g$ such that:

    $$a x_g + b y_g = g$$

    If $c$ is divisible by $g = \gcd(a, b)$, then the given Diophantine equation has a solution, otherwise it does not have any solution. The proof is straight-forward: a linear combination of two numbers is divisible by their common divisor.

    Now supposed that $c$ is divisible by $g$, then we have:

    $$a \cdot x_g \cdot \frac{c}{g} + b \cdot y_g \cdot \frac{c}{g} = c$$

    Therefore one of the solutions of the Diophantine equation is:

    $$x_0 = x_g \cdot \frac{c}{g},$$

    $$y_0 = y_g \cdot \frac{c}{g}.$$

    The above idea still works when $a$ or $b$ or both of them are negative. We only need to change the sign of $x_0$ and $y_0$ when necessary.

    Finally, we can implement this idea as follows (note that this code does not consider the case $a = b = 0$):

    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_any}
    int gcd(int a, int b, int& x, int& y) {
        if (b == 0) {
            x = 1;
            y = 0;
            return a;
        }
        int x1, y1;
        int d = gcd(b, a % b, x1, y1);
        x = y1;
        y = x1 - y1 * (a / b);
        return d;
    }

    bool find_any_solution(int a, int b, int c, int &x0, int &y0, int &g) {
        g = gcd(abs(a), abs(b), x0, y0);
        if (c % g) {
            return false;
        }

        x0 *= c / g;
        y0 *= c / g;
        if (a < 0) x0 = -x0;
        if (b < 0) y0 = -y0;
        return true;
    }
    ```

    ## Getting all solutions

    From one solution $(x_0, y_0)$, we can obtain all the solutions of the given equation.

    Let $g = \gcd(a, b)$ and let $x_0, y_0$ be integers which satisfy the following:

    $$a \cdot x_0 + b \cdot y_0 = c$$

    Now, we should see that adding $b / g$ to $x_0$, and, at the same time subtracting $a / g$ from $y_0$ will not break the equality:

    $$a \cdot \left(x_0 + \frac{b}{g}\right) + b \cdot \left(y_0 - \frac{a}{g}\right) = a \cdot x_0 + b \cdot y_0 + a \cdot \frac{b}{g} - b \cdot \frac{a}{g} = c$$

    Obviously, this process can be repeated again, so all the numbers of the form:

    $$x = x_0 + k \cdot \frac{b}{g}$$

    $$y = y_0 - k \cdot \frac{a}{g}$$

    are solutions of the given Diophantine equation.

    Moreover, this is the set of all possible solutions of the given Diophantine equation.

    ## Finding the number of solutions and the solutions in a given interval

    From previous section, it should be clear that if we don't impose any restrictions on the solutions, there would be infinite number of them. So in this section, we add some restrictions on the interval of $x$ and $y$, and we will try to count and enumerate all the solutions.

    Let there be two intervals: $[min_x; max_x]$ and $[min_y; max_y]$ and let's say we only want to find the solutions in these two intervals.

    Note that if $a$ or $b$ is $0$, then the problem only has one solution. We don't consider this case here.

    First, we can find a solution which have minimum value of $x$, such that $x \ge min_x$. To do this, we first find any solution of the Diophantine equation. Then, we shift this solution to get $x \ge min_x$ (using what we know about the set of all solutions in previous section). This can be done in $O(1)$.
    Denote this minimum value of $x$ by $l_{x1}$.

    Similarly, we can find the maximum value of $x$ which satisfy $x \le max_x$. Denote this maximum value of $x$ by $r_{x1}$.

    Similarly, we can find the minimum value of $y$ $(y \ge min_y)$ and maximum values of $y$ $(y \le max_y)$. Denote the corresponding values of $x$ by $l_{x2}$ and $r_{x2}$.

    The final solution is all solutions with x in intersection of $[l_{x1}, r_{x1}]$ and $[l_{x2}, r_{x2}]$. Let denote this intersection by $[l_x, r_x]$.

    Following is the code implementing this idea.
    Notice that we divide $a$ and $b$ at the beginning by $g$.
    Since the equation $a x + b y = c$ is equivalent to the equation $\frac{a}{g} x + \frac{b}{g} y = \frac{c}{g}$, we can use this one instead and have $\gcd(\frac{a}{g}, \frac{b}{g}) = 1$, which simplifies the formulas.

    ```{.cpp file=linear_diophantine_all}
    void shift_solution(int & x, int & y, int a, int b, int cnt) {
        x += cnt * b;
        y -= cnt * a;
    }

    int find_all_solutions(int a, int b, int c, int minx, int maxx, int miny, int maxy) {
        int x, y, g;
        if (!find_any_solution(a, b, c, x, y, g))
            return 0;
        a /= g;
        b /= g;

        int sign_a = a > 0 ? +1 : -1;
        int sign_b = b > 0 ? +1 : -1;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (minx - x) / b);
        if (x < minx)
            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_b);
        if (x > maxx)
            return 0;
        int lx1 = x;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, (maxx - x) / b);
        if (x > maxx)
            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_b);
        int rx1 = x;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(miny - y) / a);
        if (y < miny)
            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -sign_a);
        if (y > maxy)
            return 0;
        int lx2 = x;

        shift_solution(x, y, a, b, -(maxy - y) / a);
        if (y > maxy)
            shift_solution(x, y, a, b, sign_a);
        int rx2 = x;

        if (lx2 > rx2)
            swap(lx2, rx2);
        int lx = max(lx1, lx2);
        int rx = min(rx1, rx2);

        if (lx > rx)
            return 0;
        return (rx - lx) / abs(b) + 1;

    Title: Check if two segments intersect
    Part: 1/1
    # Check if two segments intersect

    You are given two segments $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$.
    You have to check if they intersect.
    Of course, you may find their intersection and check if it isn't empty, but this can't be done in integers for segments with integer coordinates.
    The approach described here can work in integers.

    ## Algorithm

    Firstly, consider the case when the segments are part of the same line.
    In this case it is sufficient to check if their projections on $Ox$ and $Oy$ intersect.
    In the other case $a$ and $b$ must not lie on the same side of line $(c, d)$, and $c$ and $d$ must not lie on the same side of line $(a, b)$.
    It can be checked with a couple of cross products.

    ## Implementation

    The given algorithm is implemented for integer points. Of course, it can be easily modified to work with doubles.

    ```{.cpp file=check-segments-inter}
    struct pt {
        long long x, y;
        pt() {}
        pt(long long _x, long long _y) : x(_x), y(_y) {}
        pt operator-(const pt& p) const { return pt(x - p.x, y - p.y); }
        long long cross(const pt& p) const { return x * p.y - y * p.x; }
        long long cross(const pt& a, const pt& b) const { return (a - *this).cross(b - *this); }
    };

    int sgn(const long long& x) { return x >= 0 ? x ? 1 : 0 : -1; }

    bool inter1(long long a, long long b, long long c, long long d) {
        if (a > b)
            swap(a, b);
        if (c > d)
            swap(c, d);
        return max(a, c) <= min(b, d);
    }

    bool check_inter(const pt& a, const pt& b, const pt& c, const pt& d) {
        if (c.cross(a, d) == 0 && c.cross(b, d) == 0)
            return inter1(a.x, b.x, c.x, d.x) && inter1(a.y, b.y, c.y, d.y);
        return sgn(a.cross(b, c)) != sgn(a.cross(b, d)) &&
               sgn(c.cross(d, a)) != sgn(c.cross(d, b));
    }
    ```

    ### Properties

    As for the cross product, it equals to the zero vector iff the vectors $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$ are collinear (they form a common line, i.e. they are parallel).
    The same thing holds for the triple product, it is equal to zero iff the vectors $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ are coplanar (they form a common plane).

    From this we can obtain universal equations defining lines and planes.
    A line can be defined via its direction vector $\mathbf d$ and an initial point $\mathbf r_0$ or by two points $\mathbf a$ and $\mathbf b$.
    It is defined as $(\mathbf r - \mathbf r_0)\times\mathbf d=0$ or as $(\mathbf r - \mathbf a)\times (\mathbf b - \mathbf a) = 0$.
    As for planes, it can be defined by three points $\mathbf a$, $\mathbf b$ and $\mathbf c$ as $(\mathbf r - \mathbf a)\cdot((\mathbf b - \mathbf a)\times (\mathbf c - \mathbf a))=0$ or by initial point $\mathbf r_0$ and two direction vectors lying in this plane $\mathbf d_1$ and $\mathbf d_2$: $(\mathbf r - \mathbf r_0)\cdot(\mathbf d_1\times \mathbf d_2)=0$.

    In 2D the pseudo-scalar product also may be used to check the orientation between two vectors because it is positive if the rotation from the first to the second vector is clockwise and negative otherwise.
    And, of course, it can be used to calculate areas of polygons, which is described in a different article.
    A triple product can be used for the same purpose in 3D space.

    ## Exercises

    ### Line intersection

    There are many possible ways to define a line in 2D and you shouldn't hesitate to combine them.
    For example we have two lines and we want to find their intersection points.
    We can say that all points from first line can be parameterized as $\mathbf r = \mathbf a_1 + t \cdot \mathbf d_1$ where $\mathbf a_1$ is initial point, $\mathbf d_1$ is direction and $t$ is some real parameter.
    As for second line all its points must satisfy $(\mathbf r - \mathbf a_2)\times \mathbf d_2=0$. From this we can easily find parameter $t$:

    $$(\mathbf a_1 + t \cdot \mathbf d_1 - \mathbf a_2)\times \mathbf d_2=0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad t = \dfrac{(\mathbf a_2 - \mathbf a_1)\times\mathbf d_2}{\mathbf d_1\times \mathbf d_2}$$

    Let's implement function to intersect two lines.

    ```{.cpp file=basic_line_intersection}
    point2d intersect(point2d a1, point2d d1, point2d a2, point2d d2) {
        return a1 + cross(a2 - a1, d2) / cross(d1, d2) * d1;
    }
    ```

    ### Planes intersection

    However sometimes it might be hard to use some geometric insights.
    For example, you're given three planes defined by initial points $\mathbf a_i$ and directions $\mathbf d_i$ and you want to find their intersection point.
    You may note that you just have to solve the system of equations:

    $$\begin{cases}\mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n_1 = \mathbf a_1\cdot \mathbf n_1, \\ \mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n_2 = \mathbf a_2\cdot \mathbf n_2, \\ \mathbf r\cdot \mathbf n_3 = \mathbf a_3\cdot \mathbf n_3\end{cases}$$

    Instead of thinking on geometric approach, you can work out an algebraic one which can be obtained immediately.
    For example, given that you already implemented a point class, it will be easy for you to solve this system using Cramer's rule because the triple product is simply the determinant of the matrix obtained from the vectors being its columns:

    ```{.cpp file=plane_intersection}
    point3d intersect(point3d a1, point3d n1, point3d a2, point3d n2, point3d a3, point3d n3) {
        point3d x(n1.x, n2.x, n3.x);
        point3d y(n1.y, n2.y, n3.y);
        point3d z(n1.z, n2.z, n3.z); 
        point3d d(dot(a1, n1), dot(a2, n2), dot(a3, n3));
        return point3d(triple(d, y, z),
                       triple(x, d, z),
                       triple(x, y, d)) / triple(n1, n2, n3);
    }
    ```

    Now you may try to find out approaches for common geometric operations yourself to get used to all this stuff.

       else:
           return False
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def opposite_Signs(a: int, b: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the product of a and b is negative
    if a * b < 0:
        return True  # They have opposite signs
    else:
        return False  # They do not have opposite signs
```
