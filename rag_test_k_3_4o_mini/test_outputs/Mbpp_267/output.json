    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes an integer `n` and calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the first two odd natural numbers are 1 and 3, and their squares are 1 and 9, which sum to 10.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Identify the first `n` odd natural numbers. The `k`-th odd number can be calculated using the formula `2*k - 1`.\n   - Calculate the square of each of these odd numbers.\n   - Sum all the squared values together and return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function square_Sum(n):\n       sum = 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           odd_number = 2 * i - 1\n           sum += odd_number * odd_number\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Define a function to calculate the sum of squares of the first n odd natural numbers\ndef square_Sum(n):\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    sum = 0\n    # Loop through the first n odd numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th odd number\n        odd_number = 2 * i - 1\n        # Add the square of the odd number to the sum\n        sum += odd_number * odd_number\n    # Return the final sum\n    return sum\n```",
