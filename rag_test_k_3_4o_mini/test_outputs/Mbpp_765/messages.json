Therefore we have:\n  \n    $$\\phi (p) = p - 1.$$\n\n      - If $p$ is a prime number and $k \\ge 1$, then there are exactly $p^k / p$ numbers between $1$ and $p^k$ that are divisible by $p$.\n        Which gives us:\n    \n    $$\\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}.$$\n\n      - If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, then:\n    \n        \\[\\phi(a b) = \\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi(b).\\]\n    \n        This relation is not trivial to see. It follows from the [Chinese remainder theorem](chinese-remainder-theorem.md). The Chinese remainder theorem guarantees, that for each $0 \\le x < a$ and each $0 \\le y < b$, there exists a unique $0 \\le z < a b$ with $z \\equiv x \\pmod{a}$ and $z \\equiv y \\pmod{b}$. It's not hard to show that $z$ is coprime to $a b$ if and only if $x$ is coprime to $a$ and $y$ is coprime to $b$. Therefore the amount of integers coprime to $a b$ is equal to product of the amounts of $a$ and $b$.\n\n      - In general, for not coprime $a$ and $b$, the equation\n\n        \\[\\phi(ab) = \\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi(b) \\cdot \\dfrac{d}{\\phi(d)}\\]\n\n        with $d = \\gcd(a, b)$ holds.\n\n    Thus, using the first three properties, we can compute $\\phi(n)$ through the factorization of $n$ (decomposition of $n$ into a product of its prime factors).\n    If $n = {p_1}^{a_1} \\cdot {p_2}^{a_2} \\cdots {p_k}^{a_k}$, where $p_i$ are prime factors of $n$,\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    \\phi (n) &= \\phi ({p_1}^{a_1}) \\cdot \\phi ({p_2}^{a_2}) \\cdots  \\phi ({p_k}^{a_k}) \\\\\\\\\n    &= \\left({p_1}^{a_1} - {p_1}^{a_1 - 1}\\right) \\cdot \\left({p_2}^{a_2} - {p_2}^{a_2 - 1}\\right) \\cdots \\left({p_k}^{a_k} - {p_k}^{a_k - 1}\\right) \\\\\\\\\n    &= p_1^{a_1} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_1}\\right) \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2}\\right) \\cdots p_k^{a_k} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_k}\\right) \\\\\\\\\n    &= n \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2}\\right) \\cdots \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_k}\\right)\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation using factorization in $O(\\sqrt{n})$:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int phi(int n) {\n        int result = n;\n        for (int i = 2;

i <= n; i++)\n            phi[i] = i - 1;\n    \n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)\n            for (int j = 2 * i; j <= n; j += i)\n                  phi[j] -= phi[i];\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Application in Euler's theorem { #application }\n\n    The most famous and important property of Euler's totient function is expressed in **Euler's theorem**: \n\n    $$a^{\\phi(m)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod m \\quad \\text{if } a \\text{ and } m \\text{ are relatively prime.}$$\n\n    In the particular case when $m$ is prime, Euler's theorem turns into **Fermat's little theorem**:\n\n    $$a^{m - 1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod m$$\n\n    Euler's theorem and Euler's totient function occur quite often in practical applications, for example both are used to compute the [modular multiplicative inverse](module-inverse.md).\n\n    As immediate consequence we also get the equivalence:\n\n    $$a^n \\equiv a^{n \\bmod \\phi(m)} \\pmod m$$\n\n    This allows computing $x^n \\bmod m$ for very big $n$, especially if $n$ is the result of another computation, as it allows to compute $n$ under a modulo.\n\n    ## Generalization\n\n    There is a less known version of the last equivalence, that allows computing $x^n \\bmod m$ efficiently for not coprime $x$ and $m$.\n    For arbitrary $x, m$ and $n \\geq \\log_2 m$:\n\n    $$x^{n}\\equiv x^{\\phi(m)+[n \\bmod \\phi(m)]} \\mod m$$\n\n    Proof:\n\n    Let $p_1, \\dots, p_t$ be common prime divisors of $x$ and $m$, and $k_i$ their exponents in $m$.\n    With those we define $a = p_1^{k_1} \\dots p_t^{k_t}$, which makes $\\frac{m}{a}$ coprime to $x$.\n    And let $k$ be the smallest number such that $a$ divides $x^k$.\n    Assuming $n \\ge k$, we can write:\n\n    $$\\begin{align}x^n \\bmod m &= \\frac{x^k}{a}ax^{n-k}\\bmod m \\\\\n    &= \\frac{x^k}{a}\\left(ax^{n-k}\\bmod m\\right) \\bmod m \\\\\n    &= \\frac{x^k}{a}\\left(ax^{n-k}\\bmod a \\frac{m}{a}\\right) \\bmod m \\\\\n    &=\\frac{x^k}{a} a \\left(x^{n-k} \\bmod \\frac{m}{a}\\right)\\bmod m \\\\\n    &= x^k\\left(x^{n-k} \\bmod \\frac{m}{a}\\right)\\bmod m\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    The equivalence between the third and forth line follows from the fact that $ab \\bmod ac = a(b \\bmod c)$.\n    Indeed if $b = cd + r$ with $r < c$, then $ab = acd + ar$ with $ar < ac$.\n\n    Since $x$ and $\\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime, we can apply Euler's theorem and get the efficient (since $k$ is very small; in fact $k \\le \\log_2 m$) formula:\n\n    $$x^n \\bmod m = x^k\\left(x^{n-k \\bmod \\phi(\\frac{m}{a})} \\bmod \\frac{m}{a}\\right)\\bmod m.$$\n\n    This formula is difficult to apply, but we can use it to analyze the behavior of $x^n \\bmod m$. We can see that the sequence of powers $(x^1 \\bmod m, x^2 \\bmod m, x^3 \\bmod m, \\dots)$ enters a cycle of length $\\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right)$ after the first $k$ (or less) elements. \n    $\\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right)$ divides $\\phi(m)$ (because $a$ and $\\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime we have $\\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right) = \\phi(m)$), therefore we can also say that the period has length $\\phi(m)$.\n    And since $\\phi(m) \\ge \\log_2 m \\ge k$, we can conclude the desired, much simpler, formula:\n\n    $$ x^n \\equiv x^{\\phi(m)} x^{(n - \\phi(m)) \\bmod \\phi(m)} \\bmod m \\equiv x^{\\phi(m)+[n \\bmod \\phi(m)]} \\mod m.$$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

        "content": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to write a function that finds the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The function should return the nth polite number, and it is given that the 7th polite number is 11.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: \n   - To find the nth polite number, we need to identify which numbers are polite. \n   - A number is polite if it is not a power of 2. This is because powers of 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive integers.\n   - We can generate polite numbers by iterating through positive integers, skipping those that are powers of 2, and counting until we reach the nth polite number.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function is_polite(n: int) -> int:\n       count = 0\n       current_number = 1\n       while count < n:\n           if current_number is not a power of 2:\n               count += 1\n           current_number += 1\n       return current_number - 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two(x):\n    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0\n\ndef is_polite(n: int) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    current_number = 1\n    while count < n:\n        if not is_power_of_two(current_number):\n            count += 1\n        current_number += 1\n    return current_number - 1\n```"
