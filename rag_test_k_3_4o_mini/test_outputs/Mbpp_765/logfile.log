INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/765 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that finds the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The first few polite numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc. The only numbers that are not polite are the powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...).

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To find the nth polite number, we can iterate through positive integers, checking if each number is polite. We can do this by checking if the number is a power of two. If it is not a power of two, we count it as a polite number. We continue this process until we reach the nth polite number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function is_polite(n):
       count = 0
       current_number = 1
       while count < n:
           if current_number is not a power of two:
               count += 1
           current_number += 1
       return current_number - 1
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def is_power_of_two(x):
    # A helper function to check if x is a power of two
    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0

def is_polite(n):
    # Initialize count of polite numbers found
    count = 0
    # Start checking from the first positive integer
    current_number = 1
    
    # Loop until we find the nth polite number
    while count < n:
        # Check if the current number is not a power of two
        if not is_power_of_two(current_number):
            count += 1  # Increment the count of polite numbers
        current_number += 1  # Move to the next number
    
    # Return the last found polite number
    return current_number - 1

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. 

    \subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \subsubsection{Euler's totient function}

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    Title: Euler's totient function
    Part: 1/1
    # Euler's totient function

    Euler's totient function, also known as **phi-function** $\phi (n)$, counts the number of integers between 1 and $n$ inclusive, which are coprime to $n$. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals $1$ ($1$ is considered to be coprime to any number).

    Here are values of $\phi(n)$ for the first few positive integers:

    $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 21 \\\\ \hline
    \phi(n) & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 4 & 6 & 4 & 10 & 4 & 12 & 6 & 8 & 8 & 16 & 6 & 18 & 8 & 12 \\\\ \hline
    \end{array}$$

    ## Properties

    The following properties of Euler totient function are sufficient to calculate it for any number:

      - If $p$ is a prime number, then $\gcd(p, q) = 1$ for all $1 \le q < p$. Therefore we have:
  
    $$\phi (p) = p - 1.$$

      - If $p$ is a prime number and $k \ge 1$, then there are exactly $p^k / p$ numbers between $1$ and $p^k$ that are divisible by $p$.
        Which gives us:
    
    $$\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}.$$

      - If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, then:
    
        \[\phi(a b) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b).\]
    
        This relation is not trivial to see. It follows from the [Chinese remainder theorem](chinese-remainder-theorem.md). The Chinese remainder theorem guarantees, that for each $0 \le x < a$ and each $0 \le y < b$, there exists a unique $0 \le z < a b$ with $z \equiv x \pmod{a}$ and $z \equiv y \pmod{b}$. It's not hard to show that $z$ is coprime to $a b$ if and only if $x$ is coprime to $a$ and $y$ is coprime to $b$. Therefore the amount of integers coprime to $a b$ is equal to product of the amounts of $a$ and $b$.

      - In general, for not coprime $a$ and $b$, the equation

        \[\phi(ab) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b) \cdot \dfrac{d}{\phi(d)}\]

        with $d = \gcd(a, b)$ holds.

    Thus, using the first three properties, we can compute $\phi(n)$ through the factorization of $n$ (decomposition of $n$ into a product of its prime factors).
    If $n = {p_1}^{a_1} \cdot {p_2}^{a_2} \cdots {p_k}^{a_k}$, where $p_i$ are prime factors of $n$,

    $$\begin{align}
    \phi (n) &= \phi ({p_1}^{a_1}) \cdot \phi ({p_2}^{a_2}) \cdots  \phi ({p_k}^{a_k}) \\\\
    &= \left({p_1}^{a_1} - {p_1}^{a_1 - 1}\right) \cdot \left({p_2}^{a_2} - {p_2}^{a_2 - 1}\right) \cdots \left({p_k}^{a_k} - {p_k}^{a_k - 1}\right) \\\\
    &= p_1^{a_1} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \cdots p_k^{a_k} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right) \\\\
    &= n \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \cdots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right)
    \end{align}$$

    ## Implementation

    Here is an implementation using factorization in $O(\sqrt{n})$:

    ```cpp
    int phi(int n) {
        int result = n;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                while (n % i == 0)
                    n /= i;
                result -= result / i;
            }
        }
        if (n > 1)
            result -= result / n;
        return result;
    }
    ```

    ## Euler totient function from $1$ to $n$ in $O(n \log\log{n})$ { #etf_1_to_n data-toc-label="Euler totient function from 1 to n in <script type=\"math/tex\">O(n log log n)</script>" }

    If we need all all the totient of all numbers between $1$ and $n$, then factorizing all $n$ numbers is not efficient.
    We can use the same idea as the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](sieve-of-eratosthenes.md).
    It is still based on the property shown above, but instead of updating the temporary result for each prime factor for each number, we find all prime numbers and for each one update the temporary results of all numbers that are divisible by that prime number.

    Since this approach is basically identical to the Sieve of Eratosthenes, the complexity will also be the same: $O(n \log \log n)$

    ```cpp
    void phi_1_to_n(int n) {
        vector<int> phi(n + 1);
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
            phi[i] = i;
    
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            if (phi[i] == i) {
                for (int j = i; j <= n; j += i)
                    phi[j] -= phi[j] / i;
            }
        }
    }
    ```


    ## Divisor sum property { #divsum}

    This interesting property was established by Gauss:

    $$ \sum_{d|n} \phi{(d)} = n$$

    Here the sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.

    For instance the divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10.
    Hence $\phi{(1)} + \phi{(2)} + \phi{(5)} + \phi{(10)} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10$.

    ### Finding the totient from 1 to $n$ using the divisor sum property { data-toc-label="Finding the totient from 1 to n using the divisor sum property" }

    The divisor sum property also allows us to compute the totient of all numbers between 1 and $n$.
    This implementation is a little simpler than the previous implementation based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes, however also has a slightly worse complexity: $O(n \log n)$

    ```cpp
    void phi_1_to_n(int n) {
        vector<int> phi(n + 1);
        phi[0] = 0;
        phi[1] = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
            phi[i] = i - 1;
    
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
            for (int j = 2 * i; j <= n; j += i)
                  phi[j] -= phi[i];
    }
    ```

    ## Application in Euler's theorem { #application }

    The most famous and important property of Euler's totient function is expressed in **Euler's theorem**: 

    $$a^{\phi(m)} \equiv 1 \pmod m \quad \text{if } a \text{ and } m \text{ are relatively prime.}$$

    In the particular case when $m$ is prime, Euler's theorem turns into **Fermat's little theorem**:

    $$a^{m - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod m$$

    Euler's theorem and Euler's totient function occur quite often in practical applications, for example both are used to compute the [modular multiplicative inverse](module-inverse.md).

    As immediate consequence we also get the equivalence:

    $$a^n \equiv a^{n \bmod \phi(m)} \pmod m$$

    This allows computing $x^n \bmod m$ for very big $n$, especially if $n$ is the result of another computation, as it allows to compute $n$ under a modulo.

    ## Generalization

    There is a less known version of the last equivalence, that allows computing $x^n \bmod m$ efficiently for not coprime $x$ and $m$.
    For arbitrary $x, m$ and $n \geq \log_2 m$:

    $$x^{n}\equiv x^{\phi(m)+[n \bmod \phi(m)]} \mod m$$

    Proof:

    Let $p_1, \dots, p_t$ be common prime divisors of $x$ and $m$, and $k_i$ their exponents in $m$.
    With those we define $a = p_1^{k_1} \dots p_t^{k_t}$, which makes $\frac{m}{a}$ coprime to $x$.
    And let $k$ be the smallest number such that $a$ divides $x^k$.
    Assuming $n \ge k$, we can write:

    $$\begin{align}x^n \bmod m &= \frac{x^k}{a}ax^{n-k}\bmod m \\
    &= \frac{x^k}{a}\left(ax^{n-k}\bmod m\right) \bmod m \\
    &= \frac{x^k}{a}\left(ax^{n-k}\bmod a \frac{m}{a}\right) \bmod m \\
    &=\frac{x^k}{a} a \left(x^{n-k} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m \\
    &= x^k\left(x^{n-k} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m
    \end{align}$$

    The equivalence between the third and forth line follows from the fact that $ab \bmod ac = a(b \bmod c)$.
    Indeed if $b = cd + r$ with $r < c$, then $ab = acd + ar$ with $ar < ac$.

    Since $x$ and $\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime, we can apply Euler's theorem and get the efficient (since $k$ is very small; in fact $k \le \log_2 m$) formula:

    $$x^n \bmod m = x^k\left(x^{n-k \bmod \phi(\frac{m}{a})} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m.$$

    This formula is difficult to apply, but we can use it to analyze the behavior of $x^n \bmod m$. We can see that the sequence of powers $(x^1 \bmod m, x^2 \bmod m, x^3 \bmod m, \dots)$ enters a cycle of length $\phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)$ after the first $k$ (or less) elements. 
    $\phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)$ divides $\phi(m)$ (because $a$ and $\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime we have $\phi(a) \cdot \phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right) = \phi(m)$), therefore we can also say that the period has length $\phi(m)$.
    And since $\phi(m) \ge \log_2 m \ge k$, we can conclude the desired, much simpler, formula:

    $$ x^n \equiv x^{\phi(m)} x^{(n - \phi(m)) \bmod \phi(m)} \bmod m \equiv x^{\phi(m)+[n \bmod \phi(m)]} \mod m.$$

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/765 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to write a function that finds the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The function should return the nth polite number, and it is given that the 7th polite number is 11.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: 
   - To find the nth polite number, we need to identify which numbers are polite. 
   - A number is polite if it is not a power of 2. This is because powers of 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive integers.
   - We can generate polite numbers by iterating through positive integers, skipping those that are powers of 2, and counting until we reach the nth polite number.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function is_polite(n: int) -> int:
       count = 0
       current_number = 1
       while count < n:
           if current_number is not a power of 2:
               count += 1
           current_number += 1
       return current_number - 1
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def is_power_of_two(x):
    return (x & (x - 1)) == 0

def is_polite(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    current_number = 1
    while count < n:
        if not is_power_of_two(current_number):
            count += 1
        current_number += 1
    return current_number - 1
