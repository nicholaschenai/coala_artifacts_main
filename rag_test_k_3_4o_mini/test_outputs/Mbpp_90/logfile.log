    Title: Longest increasing subsequence
    Part: 1/3
    # Longest increasing subsequence

    We are given an array with $n$ numbers: $a[0 \dots n-1]$.
    The task is to find the longest, strictly increasing, subsequence in $a$.

    Formally we look for the longest sequence of indices $i_1, \dots i_k$ such that

    $$i_1 < i_2 < \dots < i_k,\quad
    a[i_1] < a[i_2] < \dots < a[i_k]$$

    In this article we discuss multiple algorithms for solving this task.
    Also we will discuss some other problems, that can be reduced to this problem.

    ## Solution in $O(n^2)$ with dynamic programming {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n^2) with dynamic programming"}

    Dynamic programming is a very general technique that allows to solve a huge class of problems.
    Here we apply the technique for our specific task.

    First we will search only for the **length** of the longest increasing subsequence, and only later learn how to restore the subsequence itself.

    ### Finding the length

    To accomplish this task, we define an array $d[0 \dots n-1]$, where $d[i]$ is the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends in the element at index $i$.

    !!! example

        $$\begin{array}{ll}
        a &= \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} \\
        d &= \{1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 2\}
        \end{array}$$

        The longest increasing subsequence that ends at index 4 is $\{3, 4, 5\}$ with a length of 3, the longest ending at index 8 is either $\{3, 4, 5, 7, 9\}$ or $\{3, 4, 6, 7, 9\}$, both having length 5, and the longest ending at index 9 is $\{0, 1\}$ having length 2.

    We will compute this array gradually: first $d[0]$, then $d[1]$, and so on.
    After this array is computed, the answer to the problem will be the maximum value in the array $d[]$.

    So let the current index be $i$.
    I.e. we want to compute the value $d[i]$ and all previous values $d[0], \dots, d[i-1]$ are already known.
    Then there are two options:

    -   $d[i] = 1$: the required subsequence consists only of the element $a[i]$.

    -   $d[i] > 1$: The subsequence will end it $a[i]$, and right before it will be some number $a[j]$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

        It's easy to see, that the subsequence ending in $a[j]$ will itself be one of the longest increasing subsequences that ends in $a[j]$.
        The number $a[i]$ just extends that longest increasing subsequence by one number.

        Therefore, we can just iterate over all $j < i$ with $a[j] < a[i]$, and take the longest sequence that we get by appending $a[i]$ to the longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$.
        The longest increasing subsequence ending in $a[j]$ has length $d[j]$, extending it by one gives the length $d[j] + 1$.
  
        $$d[i] = \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)$$

    If we combine these two cases we get the final answer for $d[i]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(1, \max_{\substack{j < i \\\\ a[j] < a[i]}} \left(d[j] + 1\right)\right)$$

    ### Implementation

    Here is an implementation of the algorithm described above, which computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i])
                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            ans = max(ans, d[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.

    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.
    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.
    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.

    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.

    ### Implementation of restoring

    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.
    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.

    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.
    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}
    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (a[j] < a[i] && d[i] < d[j] + 1) {
                    d[i] = d[j] + 1;
                    p[i] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = d[0], pos = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (d[i] > ans) {
                ans = d[i];
                pos = i;
            }
        }

        vector<int> subseq;
        while (pos != -1) {
            subseq.push_back(a[pos]);
            pos = p[pos];
        }
        reverse(subseq.begin(), subseq.end());
        return subseq;
    }

    ### Alternative way of restoring the subsequence

    It is also possible to restore the subsequence without the auxiliary array $p[]$.
    We can simply recalculate the current value of $d[i]$ and also see how the maximum was reached.

    This method leads to a slightly longer code, but in return we save some memory.

    ## Solution in $O(n \log n)$ with dynamic programming and binary search {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n log n) with dynamic programming and binary search"}

    In order to obtain a faster solution for the problem, we construct a different dynamic programming solution that runs in $O(n^2)$, and then later improve it to $O(n \log n)$.

    We will use the dynamic programming array $d[0 \dots n]$.
    This time $d[l]$ doesn't corresponds to the element $a[i]$ or to an prefix of the array. 
    $d[l]$ will be the smallest element at which an increasing subsequence of length $l$ ends.

    Initially we assume $d[0] = -\infty$ and for all other lengths $d[l] = \infty$.

    We will again gradually process the numbers, first $a[0]$, then $a[1]$, etc, and in each step maintain the array $d[]$ so that it is up to date.

    !!! example

        Given the array $a = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\}$, here are all their prefixes and their dynamic programming array.
        Notice, that the values of the array don't always change at the end.

        $$
        \begin{array}{ll}
        \text{prefix} = \{\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 8, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 3, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 3, 4, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 3, 4, 6, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 3, 4, 5, \infty, \dots\}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 2, 4, 5, \infty, \dots \}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 0, 4, 5, \infty, \dots \}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 0, 4, 5, 7, \infty, \dots \}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 0, 4, 5, 7, 9, \infty, \dots \}\\
        \text{prefix} = \{8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 2, 0, 7, 9, 1\} &\quad d = \{-\infty, 0, 1, 5, 7, 9, \infty, \dots \}\\
        \end{array}
        $$

    When we process $a[i]$, we can ask ourselves.
    What have the conditions to be, that we write the current number $a[i]$ into the $d[0 \dots n]$ array?

    We set $d[l] = a[i]$, if there is a longest increasing sequence of length $l$ that ends in $a[i]$, and there is no longest increasing sequence of length $l$ that ends in a smaller number.
    Similar to the previous approach, if we remove the number $a[i]$ from the longest increasing sequence of length $l$, we get another longest increasing sequence of length $l -1$.
    So we want to extend a longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ by the number $a[i]$, and obviously the longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ that ends with the smallest element will work the best, in other words the sequence of length $l-1$ that ends in element $d[l-1]$.

    There is a longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ that we can extend with the number $a[i]$, exactly if $d[l-1] < a[i]$.
    So we can just iterate over each length $l$, and check if we can extend a longest increasing sequence of length $l - 1$ by checking the criteria.

    Additionally we also need to check, if we maybe have already found a longest increasing sequence of length $l$ with a smaller number at the end.
    So we only update if $a[i] < d[l]$.

    After processing all the elements of $a[]$ the length of the desired subsequence is the largest $l$ with $d[l] < \infty$.

    ```{.cpp file=lis_method2_n2}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        const int INF = 1e9;
        vector<int> d(n+1, INF);
        d[0] = -INF;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int l = 1; l <= n; l++) {
                if (d[l-1] < a[i] && a[i] < d[l])
                    d[l] = a[i];
            }
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int l = 0; l <= n; l++) {
            if (d[l] < INF)
                ans = l;
        }
        return ans;
    }
    ```

    We now make two important observations.

    1.  The array $d$ will always be sorted: 
        $d[l-1] < d[l]$ for all $i = 1 \dots n$.

        This is trivial, as you can just remove the last element from the increasing subsequence of length $l$, and you get a increasing subsequence of length $l-1$ with a smalller ending number.

    2.  The element $a[i]$ will only update at most one value $d[l]$.

        This follows immediately from the above implementation.
        There can only be one place in the array with $d[l-1] < a[i] < d[l]$.

    Thus we can find this element in the array $d[]$ using [binary search](../num_methods/binary_search.md) in $O(\log n)$.
    In fact we can simply look in the array $d[]$ for the first number that is strictly greater than $a[i]$, and we try to update this element in the same way as the above implementation.

    ### Implementation

    This gives us the improved $O(n \log n)$ implementation:

    ```{.cpp file=lis_method2_nlogn}
    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {
        int n = a.size();
        const int INF = 1e9;
        vector<int> d(n+1, INF);
        d[0] = -INF;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int l = upper_bound(d.begin(), d.end(), a[i]) - d.begin();
            if (d[l-1] < a[i] && a[i] < d[l])
                d[l] = a[i];
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int l = 0; l <= n; l++) {
            if (d[l] < INF)
                ans = l;
        }
        return ans;
    }

    Let $\texttt{length}(k)$ denote
    the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position $k$.
    Thus, if we calculate all values of
    $\texttt{length}(k)$ where $0 \le k \le n-1$,
    we will find out the length of the
    longest increasing subsequence.
    For example, the values of the function
    for the above array are as follows:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{length}(0) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{length}(4) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{length}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{length}(6) & = & 4 \\
    \texttt{length}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{length}(6)=4$,
    because the longest increasing subsequence
    that ends at position 6 consists of 4 elements.

    To calculate a value of $\texttt{length}(k)$,
    we should find a position $i<k$
    for which $\texttt{array}[i]<\texttt{array}[k]$
    and $\texttt{length}(i)$ is as large as possible.
    Then we know that
    $\texttt{length}(k)=\texttt{length}(i)+1$,
    because this is an optimal way to add
    $\texttt{array}[k]$ to a subsequence.
    However, if there is no such position $i$,
    then $\texttt{length}(k)=1$,
    which means that the subsequence only contains
    $\texttt{array}[k]$.

    Since all values of the function can be calculated
    from its smaller values,
    we can use dynamic programming.
    In the following code, the values
    of the function will be stored in an array
    $\texttt{length}$.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        length[k] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (array[i] < array[k]) {
                length[k] = max(length[k],length[i]+1);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    This code works in $O(n^2)$ time,
    because it consists of two nested loops.
    However, it is also possible to implement
    the dynamic programming calculation
    more efficiently in $O(n \log n)$ time.
    Can you find a way to do this?

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/90 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest word in that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the length of the longest word, we can iterate through each word in the list, measure its length, and keep track of the maximum length encountered during the iteration. At the end of the iteration, we will have the length of the longest word.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function len_log(words):
       max_length = 0
       for each word in words:
           current_length = length of word
           if current_length > max_length:
               max_length = current_length
       return max_length
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def len_log(words):
    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length
    max_length = 0
    
    # Iterate through each word in the list
