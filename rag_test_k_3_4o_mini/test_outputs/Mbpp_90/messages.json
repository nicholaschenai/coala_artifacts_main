i < n; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {\n                if (a[j] < a[i])\n                    d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = d[0];\n        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n            ans = max(ans, d[i]);\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    So far we only learned how to find the length of the subsequence, but not how to find the subsequence itself.\n\n    To be able to restore the subsequence we generate an additional auxiliary array $p[0 \\dots n-1]$ that we will compute alongside the array $d[]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index $j$ of the second last element in the longest increasing subsequence ending in $i$.\n    In other words the index $p[i]$ is the same index $j$ at which the highest value $d[i]$ was obtained.\n    This auxiliary array $p[]$ points in some sense to the ancestors.\n\n    Then to derive the subsequence, we just start at the index $i$ with the maximal $d[i]$, and follow the ancestors until we deduced the entire subsequence, i.e. until we reach the element with $d[i] = 1$.\n\n    ### Implementation of restoring\n\n    We will change the code from the previous sections a little bit.\n    We will compute the array $p[]$ alongside $d[]$, and afterwards compute the subsequence.\n\n    For convenience we originally assign the ancestors with $p[i] = -1$.\n    For elements with $d[i] = 1$, the ancestors value will remain $-1$, which will be slightly more convenient for restoring the subsequence.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_n2_restore}\n    vector<int> lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        vector<int> d(n, 1), p(n, -1);\n        for (int i = 0;

i < n; i++) {\n            for (int l = 1; l <= n; l++) {\n                if (d[l-1] < a[i] && a[i] < d[l])\n                    d[l] = a[i];\n            }\n        }\n\n        int ans = 0;\n        for (int l = 0; l <= n; l++) {\n            if (d[l] < INF)\n                ans = l;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We now make two important observations.\n\n    1.  The array $d$ will always be sorted: \n        $d[l-1] < d[l]$ for all $i = 1 \\dots n$.\n\n        This is trivial, as you can just remove the last element from the increasing subsequence of length $l$, and you get a increasing subsequence of length $l-1$ with a smalller ending number.\n\n    2.  The element $a[i]$ will only update at most one value $d[l]$.\n\n        This follows immediately from the above implementation.\n        There can only be one place in the array with $d[l-1] < a[i] < d[l]$.\n\n    Thus we can find this element in the array $d[]$ using [binary search](../num_methods/binary_search.md) in $O(\\log n)$.\n    In fact we can simply look in the array $d[]$ for the first number that is strictly greater than $a[i]$, and we try to update this element in the same way as the above implementation.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    This gives us the improved $O(n \\log n)$ implementation:\n\n    ```{.cpp file=lis_method2_nlogn}\n    int lis(vector<int> const& a) {\n        int n = a.size();\n        const int INF = 1e9;\n        vector<int> d(n+1, INF);\n        d[0] = -INF;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            int l = upper_bound(d.begin(), d.end(), a[i]) - d.begin();\n            if (d[l-1] < a[i] && a[i] < d[l])\n                d[l] = a[i];\n        }\n\n        int ans = 0;\n        for (int l = 0; l <= n; l++) {\n            if (d[l] < INF)\n                ans = l;\n        }\n        return ans;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Dynamic programming\n    Section: Longest increasing subsequence\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Longest increasing subsequence}\n\n    \\index{longest increasing subsequence}\n\n    Our first problem is to find the\n    \\key{longest increasing subsequence}\n    in an array of $n$ elements.\n    This is a maximum-length\n    sequence of array elements\n    that goes from left to right,\n    and each element in the sequence is larger\n    than the previous element.\n    For example, in the array\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$3$};\n\n    \\footnotesize\n    \\node at (0.5,1.4) {$0$};\n    \\node at (1.5,1.4) {$1$};\n    \\node at (2.5,1.4) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,1.4) {$3$};\n    \\node at (4.5,1.4) {$4$};\n    \\node at (5.5,1.4) {$5$};\n    \\node at (6.5,1.4) {$6$};\n    \\node at (7.5,1.4) {$7$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    the longest increasing subsequence\n    contains 4 elements:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (2,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (2,0) rectangle (3,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (4,0) rectangle (5,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (6,0) rectangle (7,1);\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$3$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (1.5,-0.25) .. controls (1.75,-1.00) and (2.25,-1.00) ..

At the end of the iteration, we will have the length of the longest word.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function len_log(words):\n       max_length = 0\n       for each word in words:\n           current_length = length of word\n           if current_length > max_length:\n               max_length = current_length\n       return max_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef len_log(words):\n    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each word in the list\n    for word in words:\n        # Get the length of the current word\n        current_length = len(word)\n        \n        # Update max_length if the current word is longer\n        if current_length > max_length:\n            max_length = current_length\n            \n    # Return the length of the longest word found\n    return max_length\n```"
