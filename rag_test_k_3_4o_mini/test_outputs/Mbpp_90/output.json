    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest word in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the length of the longest word, we can iterate through each word in the list, measure its length, and keep track of the maximum length encountered during the iteration. At the end of the iteration, we will have the length of the longest word.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function len_log(words):\n       max_length = 0\n       for each word in words:\n           current_length = length of word\n           if current_length > max_length:\n               max_length = current_length\n       return max_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef len_log(words):\n    # Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each word in the list\n    for word in words:\n        # Get the length of the current word\n        current_length = len(word)\n        \n        # Update max_length if the current word is longer\n        if current_length > max_length:\n            max_length = current_length\n            \n    # Return the length of the longest word found\n    return max_length\n```",
