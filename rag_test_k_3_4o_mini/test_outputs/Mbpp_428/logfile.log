INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/428 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that sorts an array of numbers using the Shell sort algorithm. The function should take a list of integers as input and return a new list that is sorted in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   Shell sort is an optimization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The algorithm starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. The process continues until the gap is reduced to one, at which point the list is sorted using a simple insertion sort.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function shell_sort(arr):
       n = length of arr
       gap = n // 2  // Start with a big gap, then reduce the gap
       while gap > 0:
           for i from gap to n-1:
               temp = arr[i]
               j = i
               // Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found
               while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                   arr[j] = arr[j - gap]
                   j -= gap
               arr[j] = temp
           gap //= 2  // Reduce the gap for the next element
       return arr
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def shell_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)  # Get the length of the array
    gap = n // 2  # Start with a big gap, then reduce the gap
    while gap > 0:  # Continue until the gap is reduced to zero
        for i in range(gap, n):  # Start from the gap to the end of the array
            temp = arr[i]  # Store the current element
            j = i  # Initialize j to the current index
            # Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found
            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:
                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]  # Move the element at j-gap to position j
                j -= gap  # Move j back by the gap
            arr[j] = temp  # Place the stored element in its correct position
        gap //= 2  # Reduce the gap for the next iteration
    return arr  # Return the sorted array

    \index{sorting}

    \key{Sorting}
    is a fundamental algorithm design problem.
    Many efficient algorithms
    use sorting as a subroutine,
    because it is often easier to process
    data if the elements are in a sorted order.

    For example, the problem ''does an array contain
    two equal elements?'' is easy to solve using sorting.
    If the array contains two equal elements,
    they will be next to each other after sorting,
    so it is easy to find them.
    Also, the problem ''what is the most frequent element
    in an array?'' can be solved similarly.

    There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are
    also good examples of how to apply
    different algorithm design techniques.
    The efficient general sorting algorithms
    work in $O(n \log n)$ time,
    and many algorithms that use sorting
    as a subroutine also
    have this time complexity.

    \section{Sorting theory}

    The basic problem in sorting is as follows:
    \begin{framed}
    \noindent
    Given an array that contains $n$ elements,
    your task is to sort the elements
    in increasing order.
    \end{framed}
    \noindent
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    will be as follows after sorting:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{$O(n^2)$ algorithms}

    \index{bubble sort}

    Simple algorithms for sorting an array
    work in $O(n^2)$ time.
    Such algorithms are short and usually
    consist of two nested loops.
    A famous $O(n^2)$ time sorting algorithm
    is \key{bubble sort} where the elements
    ''bubble'' in the array according to their values.

    Bubble sort consists of $n$ rounds.
    On each round, the algorithm iterates through
    the elements of the array.
    Whenever two consecutive elements are found
    that are not in correct order,
    the algorithm swaps them.
    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) {
            if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
                swap(array[j],array[j+1]);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    After the first round of the algorithm,
    the largest element will be in the correct position,
    and in general, after $k$ rounds, the $k$ largest
    elements will be in the correct positions.
    Thus, after $n$ rounds, the whole array
    will be sorted.

    For example, in the array

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \noindent
    the first round of bubble sort swaps elements
    as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Inversions}

    \index{inversion}

    Bubble sort is an example of a sorting
    algorithm that always swaps \emph{consecutive}
    elements in the array.
    It turns out that the time complexity
    of such an algorithm is \emph{always}
    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,
    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.

    A useful concept when analyzing sorting
    algorithms is an \key{inversion}:
    a pair of array elements
    $(\texttt{array}[a],\texttt{array}[b])$ such that
    $a<b$ and $\texttt{array}[a]>\texttt{array}[b]$,
    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    has three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.
    The number of inversions indicates
    how much work is needed to sort the array.
    An array is completely sorted when
    there are no inversions.
    On the other hand, if the array elements
    are in the reverse order,
    the number of inversions is the largest possible:
    \[1+2+\cdots+(n-1)=\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\]

    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are
    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion
    from the array.
    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only
    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes
    at most one inversion, and the time complexity
    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{$O(n \log n)$ algorithms}

    \index{merge sort}

    It is possible to sort an array efficiently
    in $O(n \log n)$ time using algorithms
    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.
    One such algorithm is \key{merge sort}\footnote{According to \cite{knu983},
    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},
    which is based on recursion.

    Merge sort sorts a subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$ as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.
    \item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\lfloor (a+b)/2 \rfloor$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$.
    \item \emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and
    \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    into a sorted subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$.
    \end{enumerate}

    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it
    halves the size of the subarray at each step.
    The recursion consists of $O(\log n)$ levels,
    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.
    Merging the subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.

    For example, consider sorting the following array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9
[/Textbook Reference Material]


[Textbook Reference Material]:
    Chapter: Sorting
    Section: Sorting theory
    Part: 2/2
    $};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    The array will be divided into two subarrays
    as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,1);
    \draw (5,0) grid (9,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};

    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Then, the subarrays will be sorted recursively
    as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (4,1);
    \draw (5,0) grid (9,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};

    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Finally, the algorithm merges the sorted
    subarrays and creates the final sorted array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Sorting lower bound}

    Is it possible to sort an array faster
    than in $O(n \log n)$ time?
    It turns out that this is \emph{not} possible
    when we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms
    that are based on comparing array elements.

    The lower bound for the time complexity
    can be proved by considering sorting
    as a process where each comparison of two elements
    gives more information about the contents of the array.
    The process creates the following tree:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) rectangle (3,1);
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (-2.5,-1.5);
    \draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (5.5,-1.5);

    \draw (-4,-2.5) rectangle (-1,-1.5);
    \draw (4,-2.5) rectangle (7,-1.5);
    \node at (-2.5,-2) {$x < y?$};
    \node at (5.5,-2) {$x < y?$};

    \draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-4.5,-4);

    Here ''$x<y?$'' means that some elements
    $x$ and $y$ are compared.
    If $x<y$, the process continues to the left,
    and otherwise to the right.
    The results of the process are the possible
    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.
    For this reason, the height of the tree
    must be at least
    \[ \log_2(n!) = \log_2(1)+\log_2(2)+\cdots+\log_2(n).\]
    We get a lower bound for this sum
    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and
    changing the value of each element to $\log_2(n/2)$.
    This yields an estimate
    \[ \log_2(n!) \ge (n/2) \cdot \log_2(n/2),\]
    so the height of the tree and the minimum
    possible number of steps in a sorting
    algorithm in the worst case
    is at least $n \log n$.

    \subsubsection{Counting sort}

    \index{counting sort}

    The lower bound $n \log n$ does not apply to
    algorithms that do not compare array elements
    but use some other information.
    An example of such an algorithm is
    \key{counting sort} that sorts an array in
    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array
    is an integer between $0 \ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.

    The algorithm creates a \emph{bookkeeping} array,
    whose indices are elements of the original array.
    The algorithm iterates through the original array
    and calculates how many times each element
    appears in the array.
    \newpage

    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    corresponds to the following bookkeeping array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (9,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$0$};
    \node at (8.5,0.5) {$3$};

    \footnotesize

    \node at (0.5,1.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,1.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,1.5) {$3$};
    \node at (3.5,1.5) {$4$};
    \node at (4.5,1.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,1.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,1.5) {$7$};
    \node at (7.5,1.5) {$8$};
    \node at (8.5,1.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    For example, the value at position 3
    in the bookkeeping array is 2,
    because the element 3 appears 2 times
    in the original array.

    Construction of the bookkeeping array
    takes $O(n)$ time. After this, the sorted array
    can be created in $O(n)$ time because
    the number of occurrences of each element can be retrieved
    from the bookkeeping array.
    Thus, the total time complexity of counting
    sort is $O(n)$.

    Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm
    but it can only be used when the constant $c$
    is small enough, so that the array elements can
    be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.

    Chapter: Sorting
    Section: Binary search
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Binary search}

    \index{binary search}

    A general method for searching for an element
    in an array is to use a \texttt{for} loop
    that iterates through the elements of the array.
    For example, the following code searches for
    an element $x$ in an array:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (array[i] == x) {
            // x found at index i
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The time complexity of this approach is $O(n)$,
    because in the worst case, it is necessary to check
    all elements of the array.
    If the order of the elements is arbitrary,
    this is also the best possible approach, because
    there is no additional information available where
    in the array we should search for the element $x$.

    However, if the array is \emph{sorted},
    the situation is different.
    In this case it is possible to perform the
    search much faster, because the order of the
    elements in the array guides the search.
    The following \key{binary search} algorithm
    efficiently searches for an element in a sorted array
    in $O(\log n)$ time.

    \subsubsection{Method 1}

    The usual way to implement binary search
    resembles looking for a word in a dictionary.
    The search maintains an active region in the array,
    which initially contains all array elements.
    Then, a number of steps is performed,
    each of which halves the size of the region.

    At each step, the search checks the middle element
    of the active region.
    If the middle element is the target element,
    the search terminates.
    Otherwise, the search recursively continues
    to the left or right half of the region,
    depending on the value of the middle element.

    The above idea can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int a = 0, b = n-1;
    while (a <= b) {
        int k = (a+b)/2;
        if (array[k] == x) {
            // x found at index k
        }
        if (array[k] > x) b = k-1;
        else a = k+1;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    In this implementation, the active region is $a \ldots b$,
    and initially the region is $0 \ldots n-1$.
    The algorithm halves the size of the region at each step,
    so the time complexity is $O(\log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Method 2}

    An alternative method to implement binary search
    is based on an efficient way to iterate through
    the elements of the array.
    The idea is to make jumps and slow the speed
    when we get closer to the target element.

    The search goes through the array from left to
    right, and the initial jump length is $n/2$.
    At each step, the jump length will be halved:
    first $n/4$, then $n/8$, $n/16$, etc., until
    finally the length is 1.
    After the jumps, either the target element has
    been found or we know that it does not appear in the array.

    The following code implements the above idea:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int k = 0;
    for (int b = n/2; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (k+b < n && array[k+b] <= x) k += b;
    }
    if (array[k] == x) {
        // x found at index k
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    During the search, the variable $b$
    contains the current jump length.
    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(\log n)$,
    because the code in the \texttt{while} loop
    is performed at most twice for each jump length.

    \subsubsection{C++ functions}

    The C++ standard library contains the following functions
    that are based on binary search and work in logarithmic time:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{lower\_bound} returns a pointer to the
    first array element whose value is at least $x$.
    \item \texttt{upper\_bound} returns a pointer to the
    first array element whose value is larger than $x$.
    \item \texttt{equal\_range} returns both above pointers.
    \end{itemize}

    The functions assume that the array is sorted.
    If there is no such element, the pointer points to
    the element after the last array element.
    For example, the following code finds out whether
    an array contains an element with value $x$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto k = lower_bound(array,array+n,x)-array;
    if (k < n && array[k] == x) {
        // x found at index k
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Then, the following code counts the number of elements
    whose value is $x$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto a = lower_bound(array, array+n, x);
    auto b = upper_bound(array, array+n, x);
    cout << b-a << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    Using \texttt{equal\_range}, the code becomes shorter:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    auto r = equal_range(array, array+n, x);
    cout << r.second-r.first << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Finding the smallest solution}

    An important use for binary search is
    to find the position where the value of a \emph{function} changes.
    Suppose that we wish to find the smallest value $k$
    that is a valid solution for a problem.
    We are given a function $\texttt{ok}(x)$
    that returns \texttt{true} if $x$ is a valid solution
    and \texttt{false} otherwise.
    In addition, we know that $\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \texttt{false}
    when $x<k$ and \texttt{true} when $x \ge k$.
    The situation looks as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{r|rrrrrrrr}
    $x$ & 0 & 1 & $\cdots$ & $k-1$ & $k$ & $k+1$ & $\cdots$ \\
    \hline
    $\texttt{ok}(x)$ & \texttt{false} & \texttt{false}
    & $\cdots$ & \texttt{false} & \texttt{true} & \texttt{true} & $\cdots$ \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \noindent
    Now, the value of $k$ can be found using binary search:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int x = -1;
    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (!ok(x+b)) x += b;
    }
    int k = x+1;
    \end{lstlisting}

    The search finds the largest value of $x$ for which
    $\texttt{ok}(x)$ is \texttt{false}.
    Thus, the next value $k=x+1$
    is the smallest possible value for which
    $\texttt{ok}(k)$ is \texttt{true}.
    The initial jump length $z$ has to be
    large enough, for example some value
    for which we know beforehand that $\texttt{ok}(z)$ is \texttt{true}.

    The algorithm calls the function \texttt{ok}
    $O(\log z)$ times, so the total time complexity
    depends on the function \texttt{ok}.
    For example, if the function works in $O(n)$ time,
    the total time complexity is $O(n \log z)$.

    \subsubsection{Finding the maximum value}

    Binary search can also be used to find
    the maximum value for a function that is
    first increasing and then decreasing.
    Our task is to find a position $k$ such that

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    $f(x)<f(x+1)$ when $x<k$, and
    \item
    $f(x)>f(x+1)$ when $x \ge k$.
    \end{itemize}

    The idea is to use binary search
    for finding the largest value of $x$
    for which $f(x)<f(x+1)$.
    This implies that $k=x+1$
    because $f(x+1)>f(x+2)$.
    The following code implements the search: 

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int x = -1;
    for (int b = z; b >= 1; b /= 2) {
        while (f(x+b) < f(x+b+1)) x += b;
    }
    int k = x+1;
    \end{lstlisting}

    Note that unlike in the ordinary binary search,
    here it is not allowed that consecutive values
    of the function are equal.
    In this case it would not be possible to know
    how to continue the search.
