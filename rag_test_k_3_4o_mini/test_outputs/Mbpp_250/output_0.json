    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers and a specific number (element) as inputs. The function should count how many times that specific number appears in the tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the tuple and maintain a count of how many times we encounter the specified element. At the end of the iteration, we will return the count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_X(tuple, element):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each item in tuple:\n           if item is equal to element:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_X(tup, element):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through each item in the tuple\n    for item in tup:\n        # Check if the current item is equal to the specified element\n        if item == element:\n            # Increment the count if it matches\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n```",
