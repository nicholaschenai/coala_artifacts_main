This can be done using a simple loop or a list comprehension.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function split(string):\n       create an empty list called result\n       for each character in the string:\n           append the character to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef split(string: str) -> list:\n    # Create an empty list to hold the characters\n    result = []\n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in string:\n        # Append the character to the result list\n        result.append(char)\n    # Return the list of characters\n    return result\n```",
