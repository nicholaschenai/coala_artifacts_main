INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/96 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes an integer as input and returns the count of its divisors. A divisor of a number is any integer that can divide that number without leaving a remainder.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the number of divisors of a given integer, we can iterate through all integers from 1 to that number. For each integer, we check if it divides the given number evenly (i.e., the remainder when dividing the number by this integer is zero). We will keep a count of how many integers satisfy this condition.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function divisor(n):
       initialize count to 0
       for i from 1 to n:
           if n mod i equals 0:
               increment count
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def divisor(n):
    # Initialize a count variable to keep track of the number of divisors
    count = 0
    # Loop through all integers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # If it is, increment the count
            count += 1
    # Return the total count of divisors
    return count

    Title: Number of divisors / sum of divisors
    Part: 1/1
    # Number of divisors / sum of divisors

    In this article we discuss how to compute the number of divisors $d(n)$ and the sum of divisors $\sigma(n)$ of a given number $n$.

    ## Number of divisors

    It should be obvious that the prime factorization of a divisor $d$ has to be a subset of the prime factorization of $n$, e.g. $6 = 2 \cdot 3$ is a divisor of $60 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$.
    So we only need to find all different subsets of the prime factorization of $n$.

    Usually the number of subsets is $2^x$ for a set with $x$ elements.
    However this is no longer true, if there are repeated elements in the set. In our case some prime factors may appear multiple times in the prime factorization of $n$.

    If a prime factor $p$ appears $e$ times in the prime factorization of $n$, then we can use the factor $p$ up to $e$ times in the subset.
    Which means we have $e+1$ choices.

    Therefore if the prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers, then the number of divisors is:

    $$d(n) = (e_1 + 1) \cdot (e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)$$

    A way of thinking about it is the following:

    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then there are obviously $e_1 + 1$ divisors ($1, p_1, p_1^2, \dots, p_1^{e_1}$).

    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then you can arrange all divisors in form of a tabular.

    $$\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
    & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\hline
    1 & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    p_1 & p_1 & p_1 \cdot p_2 & p_1 \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1 \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    p_1^2 & p_1^2 & p_1^2 \cdot p_2 & p_1^2 \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1^2 \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\
    p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2 & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^2 & \dots & p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\
    \end{array}$$

    So the number of divisors is trivially $(e_1 + 1) \cdot (e_2 + 1)$.

    * A similar argument can be made if there are more then two distinct prime factors.


    ```cpp
    long long numberOfDivisors(long long num) {
        long long total = 1;
        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                int e = 0;
                do {
                    e++;
                    num /= i;
                } while (num % i == 0);
                total *= e + 1;
            }
        }
        if (num > 1) {
            total *= 2;
        }
        return total;
    }
    ```

    ## Sum of divisors

    We can use the same argument of the previous section.

    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then the sum is:

    $$1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{e_1} = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1}$$

    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then we can make the same table as before.
      The only difference is that now we now want to compute the sum instead of counting the elements.
      It is easy to see, that the sum of each combination can be expressed as:

    $$\left(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{e_1}\right) \cdot \left(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_2^{e_2}\right)$$

    $$ = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \cdot \frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1}$$

    * In general, for $n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}$ we receive the formula:

    $$\sigma(n) = \frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \cdot \frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1} \cdots \frac{p_k^{e_k + 1} - 1}{p_k - 1}$$

    ```cpp
    long long SumOfDivisors(long long num) {
        long long total = 1;

        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                int e = 0;
                do {
                    e++;
                    num /= i;
                } while (num % i == 0);

                long long sum = 0, pow = 1;
                do {
                    sum += pow;
                    pow *= i;
                } while (e-- > 0);
                total *= sum;
            }
        }
        if (num > 1) {
            total *= (1 + num);
        }
        return total;
    }
    ```

    ## Multiplicative functions

    A multiplicative function is a function $f(x)$ which satisfies

    $$f(a \cdot b) = f(a) \cdot f(b)$$

    if $a$ and $b$ are coprime.

    Both $d(n)$ and $\sigma(n)$ are multiplicative functions.

    Multiplicative functions have a huge variety of interesting properties, which can be very useful in number theory problems.
    For instance the Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is also multiplicative.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    Title: Euler's totient function
    Part: 1/1
    # Euler's totient function

    Euler's totient function, also known as **phi-function** $\phi (n)$, counts the number of integers between 1 and $n$ inclusive, which are coprime to $n$. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals $1$ ($1$ is considered to be coprime to any number).

    Here are values of $\phi(n)$ for the first few positive integers:

    $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 21 \\\\ \hline
    \phi(n) & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 4 & 6 & 4 & 10 & 4 & 12 & 6 & 8 & 8 & 16 & 6 & 18 & 8 & 12 \\\\ \hline
    \end{array}$$

    ## Properties

    The following properties of Euler totient function are sufficient to calculate it for any number:

      - If $p$ is a prime number, then $\gcd(p, q) = 1$ for all $1 \le q < p$. Therefore we have:
  
    $$\phi (p) = p - 1.$$

      - If $p$ is a prime number and $k \ge 1$, then there are exactly $p^k / p$ numbers between $1$ and $p^k$ that are divisible by $p$.
        Which gives us:
    
    $$\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}.$$

      - If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, then:
    
        \[\phi(a b) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b).\]
    
        This relation is not trivial to see. It follows from the [Chinese remainder theorem](chinese-remainder-theorem.md). The Chinese remainder theorem guarantees, that for each $0 \le x < a$ and each $0 \le y < b$, there exists a unique $0 \le z < a b$ with $z \equiv x \pmod{a}$ and $z \equiv y \pmod{b}$. It's not hard to show that $z$ is coprime to $a b$ if and only if $x$ is coprime to $a$ and $y$ is coprime to $b$. Therefore the amount of integers coprime to $a b$ is equal to product of the amounts of $a$ and $b$.

      - In general, for not coprime $a$ and $b$, the equation

        \[\phi(ab) = \phi(a) \cdot \phi(b) \cdot \dfrac{d}{\phi(d)}\]

        with $d = \gcd(a, b)$ holds.

    Thus, using the first three properties, we can compute $\phi(n)$ through the factorization of $n$ (decomposition of $n$ into a product of its prime factors).
    If $n = {p_1}^{a_1} \cdot {p_2}^{a_2} \cdots {p_k}^{a_k}$, where $p_i$ are prime factors of $n$,

    $$\begin{align}
    \phi (n) &= \phi ({p_1}^{a_1}) \cdot \phi ({p_2}^{a_2}) \cdots  \phi ({p_k}^{a_k}) \\\\
    &= \left({p_1}^{a_1} - {p_1}^{a_1 - 1}\right) \cdot \left({p_2}^{a_2} - {p_2}^{a_2 - 1}\right) \cdots \left({p_k}^{a_k} - {p_k}^{a_k - 1}\right) \\\\
    &= p_1^{a_1} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdot p_2^{a_2} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \cdots p_k^{a_k} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right) \\\\
    &= n \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_1}\right) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_2}\right) \cdots \left(1 - \frac{1}{p_k}\right)
    \end{align}$$

    ## Implementation

    Here is an implementation using factorization in $O(\sqrt{n})$:

    ```cpp
    int phi(int n) {
        int result = n;
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                while (n % i == 0)
                    n /= i;
                result -= result / i;
            }
        }
        if (n > 1)
            result -= result / n;
        return result;
    }
    ```

    ## Euler totient function from $1$ to $n$ in $O(n \log\log{n})$ { #etf_1_to_n data-toc-label="Euler totient function from 1 to n in <script type=\"math/tex\">O(n log log n)</script>" }

    If we need all all the totient of all numbers between $1$ and $n$, then factorizing all $n$ numbers is not efficient.
    We can use the same idea as the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](sieve-of-eratosthenes.md).
    It is still based on the property shown above, but instead of updating the temporary result for each prime factor for each number, we find all prime numbers and for each one update the temporary results of all numbers that are divisible by that prime number.

    Since this approach is basically identical to the Sieve of Eratosthenes, the complexity will also be the same: $O(n \log \log n)$

    ```cpp
    void phi_1_to_n(int n) {
        vector<int> phi(n + 1);
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
            phi[i] = i;
    
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            if (phi[i] == i) {
                for (int j = i; j <= n; j += i)
                    phi[j] -= phi[j] / i;
            }
        }
    }
    ```


    ## Divisor sum property { #divsum}

    This interesting property was established by Gauss:

    $$ \sum_{d|n} \phi{(d)} = n$$

    Here the sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.

    For instance the divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10.
    Hence $\phi{(1)} + \phi{(2)} + \phi{(5)} + \phi{(10)} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10$.

    ### Finding the totient from 1 to $n$ using the divisor sum property { data-toc-label="Finding the totient from 1 to n using the divisor sum property" }

    The divisor sum property also allows us to compute the totient of all numbers between 1 and $n$.
    This implementation is a little simpler than the previous implementation based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes, however also has a slightly worse complexity: $O(n \log n)$

    ```cpp
    void phi_1_to_n(int n) {
        vector<int> phi(n + 1);
        phi[0] = 0;
        phi[1] = 1;

    ## Application in Euler's theorem { #application }

    The most famous and important property of Euler's totient function is expressed in **Euler's theorem**: 

    $$a^{\phi(m)} \equiv 1 \pmod m \quad \text{if } a \text{ and } m \text{ are relatively prime.}$$

    In the particular case when $m$ is prime, Euler's theorem turns into **Fermat's little theorem**:

    $$a^{m - 1} \equiv 1 \pmod m$$

    Euler's theorem and Euler's totient function occur quite often in practical applications, for example both are used to compute the [modular multiplicative inverse](module-inverse.md).

    As immediate consequence we also get the equivalence:

    $$a^n \equiv a^{n \bmod \phi(m)} \pmod m$$

    This allows computing $x^n \bmod m$ for very big $n$, especially if $n$ is the result of another computation, as it allows to compute $n$ under a modulo.

    ## Generalization

    There is a less known version of the last equivalence, that allows computing $x^n \bmod m$ efficiently for not coprime $x$ and $m$.
    For arbitrary $x, m$ and $n \geq \log_2 m$:

    $$x^{n}\equiv x^{\phi(m)+[n \bmod \phi(m)]} \mod m$$

    Proof:

    Let $p_1, \dots, p_t$ be common prime divisors of $x$ and $m$, and $k_i$ their exponents in $m$.
    With those we define $a = p_1^{k_1} \dots p_t^{k_t}$, which makes $\frac{m}{a}$ coprime to $x$.
    And let $k$ be the smallest number such that $a$ divides $x^k$.
    Assuming $n \ge k$, we can write:

    $$\begin{align}x^n \bmod m &= \frac{x^k}{a}ax^{n-k}\bmod m \\
    &= \frac{x^k}{a}\left(ax^{n-k}\bmod m\right) \bmod m \\
    &= \frac{x^k}{a}\left(ax^{n-k}\bmod a \frac{m}{a}\right) \bmod m \\
    &=\frac{x^k}{a} a \left(x^{n-k} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m \\
    &= x^k\left(x^{n-k} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m
    \end{align}$$

    The equivalence between the third and forth line follows from the fact that $ab \bmod ac = a(b \bmod c)$.
    Indeed if $b = cd + r$ with $r < c$, then $ab = acd + ar$ with $ar < ac$.

    Since $x$ and $\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime, we can apply Euler's theorem and get the efficient (since $k$ is very small; in fact $k \le \log_2 m$) formula:

    $$x^n \bmod m = x^k\left(x^{n-k \bmod \phi(\frac{m}{a})} \bmod \frac{m}{a}\right)\bmod m.$$

    This formula is difficult to apply, but we can use it to analyze the behavior of $x^n \bmod m$. We can see that the sequence of powers $(x^1 \bmod m, x^2 \bmod m, x^3 \bmod m, \dots)$ enters a cycle of length $\phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)$ after the first $k$ (or less) elements. 
    $\phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right)$ divides $\phi(m)$ (because $a$ and $\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime we have $\phi(a) \cdot \phi\left(\frac{m}{a}\right) = \phi(m)$), therefore we can also say that the period has length $\phi(m)$.
    And since $\phi(m) \ge \log_2 m \ge k$, we can conclude the desired, much simpler, formula:

    $$ x^n \equiv x^{\phi(m)} x^{(n - \phi(m)) \bmod \phi(m)} \bmod m \equiv x^{\phi(m)+[n \bmod \phi(m)]} \mod m.$$

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/96 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a Python function that calculates the number of divisors for a given integer. For example, if the input is 15, the function should return 4 because the divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the number of divisors of a number, we can iterate through all integers from 1 to the square root of the number. For each integer, we check if it divides the number evenly. If it does, we count both the divisor and its complement (the result of dividing the number by the divisor) unless they are the same (which happens when the divisor is the square root of the number).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function divisor(n):
       count = 0
       for i from 1 to sqrt(n):
           if n % i == 0:
               count += 1  // i is a divisor
               if i != n / i:
                   count += 1  // n / i is also a divisor
       return count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:

def divisor(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0  # Initialize the count of divisors
    # Iterate from 1 to the square root of n
