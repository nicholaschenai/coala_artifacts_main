In our case some prime factors may appear multiple times in the prime factorization of $n$.\n\n    If a prime factor $p$ appears $e$ times in the prime factorization of $n$, then we can use the factor $p$ up to $e$ times in the subset.\n    Which means we have $e+1$ choices.\n\n    Therefore if the prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers, then the number of divisors is:\n\n    $$d(n) = (e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$$\n\n    A way of thinking about it is the following:\n\n    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then there are obviously $e_1 + 1$ divisors ($1, p_1, p_1^2, \\dots, p_1^{e_1}$).\n\n    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then you can arrange all divisors in form of a tabular.\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n    & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\\hline\n    1 & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    p_1 & p_1 & p_1 \\cdot p_2 & p_1 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    p_1^2 & p_1^2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\\\\\n    p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2 & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    So the number of divisors is trivially $(e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1)$.\n\n    * A similar argument can be made if there are more then two distinct prime factors.\n\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long numberOfDivisors(long long num) {\n        long long total = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {\n            if (num % i == 0) {\n                int e = 0;\n                do {\n                    e++;\n                    num /= i;\n                } while (num % i == 0);\n                total *= e + 1;\n            }\n        }\n        if (num > 1) {\n            total *= 2;\n        }\n        return total;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Sum of divisors\n\n    We can use the same argument of the previous section.\n\n    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then the sum is:\n\n    $$1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\dots + p_1^{e_1} = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1}$$\n\n    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then we can make the same table as before.\n      The only difference is that now we now want to compute the sum instead of counting the elements.\n      It is easy to see, that the sum of each combination can be expressed as:\n\n    $$\\left(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\dots + p_1^{e_1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\dots + p_2^{e_2}\\right)$$\n\n    $$ = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \\cdot \\frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1}$$\n\n    * In general, for $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ we receive the formula:\n\n    $$\\sigma(n) = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \\cdot \\frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1} \\cdots \\frac{p_k^{e_k + 1} - 1}{p_k - 1}$$\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long SumOfDivisors(long long num) {\n        long long total = 1;\n\n        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {\n            if (num % i == 0) {\n                int e = 0;\n                do {\n                    e++;\n                    num /= i;\n                } while (num % i == 0);\n\n                long long sum = 0, pow = 1;\n                do {\n                    sum += pow;\n                    pow *= i;\n                } while (e-- > 0);\n                total *= sum;\n            }\n        }\n        if (num > 1) {\n            total *= (1 + num);\n        }\n        return total;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Multiplicative functions\n\n    A multiplicative function is a function $f(x)$ which satisfies\n\n    $$f(a \\cdot b) = f(a) \\cdot f(b)$$\n\n    if $a$ and $b$ are coprime.\n\n    Both $d(n)$ and $\\sigma(n)$ are multiplicative functions.\n\n    Multiplicative functions have a huge variety of interesting properties, which can be very useful in number theory problems.\n    For instance the Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is also multiplicative.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\n    Part: 2/5\n    <div id=\"the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation\"></div>\n    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }\n\n    Consider the following equation:\n\n    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$\n\n    where $0 \\le x_i \\le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\\ldots 6)$.\n\n    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.\n\n    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):\n    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:\n\n    $$N_0 = \\binom{25}{5}$$\n\n    We will now calculate the number of \"bad\" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The \"bad\" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.\n\n    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \\ge 9$, and all other $x_i \\ge 0 ~ (i \\ne k)$ (they may be $\\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:\n\n    $$ | A_k | = \\binom{16}{5} $$\n\n    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \\ne p$) is equal to:\n\n    $$ \\left| A_k \\cap A_p \\right| = \\binom{7}{5}$$\n\n    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.\n\n    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:\n\n    $$\\binom{25}{5} - \\left(\\binom{6}{1} \\cdot \\binom{16}{5} - \\binom{6}{2} \\cdot \\binom{7}{5}\\right) $$\n\n    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval\n\n    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).\n\n    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.\n\n    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\\cdots k)$.\n\n    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:\n\n    $$ \\left\\lfloor \\frac{ r }{ p_i } \\right\\rfloor $$\n\n    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors).

It follows from the [Chinese remainder theorem](chinese-remainder-theorem.md). The Chinese remainder theorem guarantees, that for each $0 \\le x < a$ and each $0 \\le y < b$, there exists a unique $0 \\le z < a b$ with $z \\equiv x \\pmod{a}$ and $z \\equiv y \\pmod{b}$. It's not hard to show that $z$ is coprime to $a b$ if and only if $x$ is coprime to $a$ and $y$ is coprime to $b$. Therefore the amount of integers coprime to $a b$ is equal to product of the amounts of $a$ and $b$.\n\n      - In general, for not coprime $a$ and $b$, the equation\n\n        \\[\\phi(ab) = \\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi(b) \\cdot \\dfrac{d}{\\phi(d)}\\]\n\n        with $d = \\gcd(a, b)$ holds.\n\n    Thus, using the first three properties, we can compute $\\phi(n)$ through the factorization of $n$ (decomposition of $n$ into a product of its prime factors).\n    If $n = {p_1}^{a_1} \\cdot {p_2}^{a_2} \\cdots {p_k}^{a_k}$, where $p_i$ are prime factors of $n$,\n\n    $$\\begin{align}\n    \\phi (n) &= \\phi ({p_1}^{a_1}) \\cdot \\phi ({p_2}^{a_2}) \\cdots  \\phi ({p_k}^{a_k}) \\\\\\\\\n    &= \\left({p_1}^{a_1} - {p_1}^{a_1 - 1}\\right) \\cdot \\left({p_2}^{a_2} - {p_2}^{a_2 - 1}\\right) \\cdots \\left({p_k}^{a_k} - {p_k}^{a_k - 1}\\right) \\\\\\\\\n    &= p_1^{a_1} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_1}\\right) \\cdot p_2^{a_2} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2}\\right) \\cdots p_k^{a_k} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_k}\\right) \\\\\\\\\n    &= n \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_2}\\right) \\cdots \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{p_k}\\right)\n    \\end{align}$$\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Here is an implementation using factorization in $O(\\sqrt{n})$:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int phi(int n) {\n        int result = n;\n        for (int i = 2;

in fact $k \\le \\log_2 m$) formula:\n\n    $$x^n \\bmod m = x^k\\left(x^{n-k \\bmod \\phi(\\frac{m}{a})} \\bmod \\frac{m}{a}\\right)\\bmod m.$$\n\n    This formula is difficult to apply, but we can use it to analyze the behavior of $x^n \\bmod m$. We can see that the sequence of powers $(x^1 \\bmod m, x^2 \\bmod m, x^3 \\bmod m, \\dots)$ enters a cycle of length $\\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right)$ after the first $k$ (or less) elements. \n    $\\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right)$ divides $\\phi(m)$ (because $a$ and $\\frac{m}{a}$ are coprime we have $\\phi(a) \\cdot \\phi\\left(\\frac{m}{a}\\right) = \\phi(m)$), therefore we can also say that the period has length $\\phi(m)$.\n    And since $\\phi(m) \\ge \\log_2 m \\ge k$, we can conclude the desired, much simpler, formula:\n\n    $$ x^n \\equiv x^{\\phi(m)} x^{(n - \\phi(m)) \\bmod \\phi(m)} \\bmod m \\equiv x^{\\phi(m)+[n \\bmod \\phi(m)]} \\mod m.$$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

For each integer, we check if it divides the number evenly.
