\\emph{consecutive}\n    elements in the array.\n    It turns out that the time complexity\n    of such an algorithm is \\emph{always}\n    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,\n    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.\n\n    A useful concept when analyzing sorting\n    algorithms is an \\key{inversion}:\n    a pair of array elements\n    $(\\texttt{array}[a],\\texttt{array}[b])$ such that\n    $a<b$ and $\\texttt{array}[a]>\\texttt{array}[b]$,\n    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at

three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.\n    The number of inversions indicates\n    how much work is needed to sort the array.\n    An array is completely sorted when\n    there are no inversions.\n    On the other hand, if the array elements\n    are in the reverse order,\n    the number of inversions is the largest possible:\n    \\[1+2+\\cdots+(n-1)=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\\]\n\n    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are\n    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion\n    from the array.\n    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only\n    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes\n    at most one inversion, and the time complexity\n    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{$O(n \\log n)$ algorithms}\n\n    \\index{merge sort}\n\n    It is possible to sort an array efficiently\n    in $O(n \\log n)$ time using algorithms\n    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.\n    One such algorithm is \\key{merge sort}\\footnote{According to \\cite{knu983},\n    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},\n    which is based on recursion.\n\n    Merge sort sorts a subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$ as follows:\n\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.\n    \\item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\\lfloor (a+b)/2 \\rfloor$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$.\n    \\item \\emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and\n    \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    into a sorted subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it\n    halves the size of the subarray at each step.\n    The recursion consists of $O(\\log n)$ levels,\n    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.\n    Merging the subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.\n\n    For example, consider sorting the following array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at

into two subarrays\n    as follows:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (4,1);\n    \\draw (5,0) grid (9,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node

(8.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Then, the subarrays will be sorted recursively\n    as follows:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (4,1);\n    \\draw (5,0) grid (9,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};\n\n    \\node at

sorted\n    subarrays and creates the final sorted array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at

out that this is \\emph{not} possible\n    when we restrict ourselves to sorting algorithms\n    that are based on comparing array elements.\n\n    The lower bound for the time complexity\n    can be proved by considering sorting\n    as a process where each comparison of two elements\n    gives more information about the contents of the array.\n    The process creates the following tree:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) rectangle (3,1);\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$x < y?$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (1.5,0) -- (-2.5,-1.5);\n    \\draw[thick,->]

\\draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-4.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-2.5,-2.5) -- (-0.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (3.5,-4);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (5.5,-2.5) -- (7.5,-4);\n\n    \\draw (-6,-5) rectangle (-3,-4);\n    \\draw (-2,-5) rectangle (1,-4);\n    \\draw (2,-5) rectangle (5,-4);\n    \\draw (6,-5) rectangle (9,-4);\n    \\node at (-4.5,-4.5) {$x < y?$};\n    \\node at

\\draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (0.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (-0.5,-5) -- (-1.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (2.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (3.5,-5) -- (4.5,-6);\n    \\draw[thick,->]

$x<y$, the process continues to the left,\n    and otherwise to the right.\n    The results of the process are the possible\n    ways to sort the array, a total of $n!$ ways.\n    For this reason, the height of the tree\n    must be at least\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) = \\log_2(1)+\\log_2(2)+\\cdots+\\log_2(n).\\]\n    We get a lower bound for this sum\n    by choosing the last $n/2$ elements and\n    changing the value of each element to $\\log_2(n/2)$.\n    This yields an estimate\n    \\[ \\log_2(n!) \\ge (n/2) \\cdot \\log_2(n/2),\\]\n    so the height of the tree and the minimum\n    possible number of steps in a sorting\n    algorithm in the worst case\n    is at least $n \\log n$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Counting sort}\n\n    \\index{counting sort}\n\n    The lower bound $n \\log n$ does not apply to\n    algorithms that do not compare array elements\n    but use some other information.\n    An example of such an algorithm is\n    \\key{counting sort} that sorts an array in\n    $O(n)$ time assuming that every element in the array\n    is an integer between $0 \\ldots c$ and $c=O(n)$.\n\n    The algorithm creates a \\emph{bookkeeping} array,\n    whose indices are elements of

$O(n)$ time.

It is required to find a subarray $a[l \\ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:\n\n    $$ \\max_{ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.\n    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\n    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.\n\n    ## Algorithm 1\n\n    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm is very simple.\n\n    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.\n\n    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \\ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.\n\n    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.\n\n    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.\n\n    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ \u2014 we will only need the current element from it.\n\n    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.\n\n    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        int cur = sum - min_sum;\n        if (cur > ans) {\n            ans = cur;\n            ans_l = min_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < min_sum) {\n            min_sum = sum;\n            min_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Algorithm 2\n\n    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.\n\n    **Proof:**\n\n    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum \u2014 so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.\n\n    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.\n\n    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a \"critical\" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \\ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.\n\n    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum);\n        sum = max(sum, 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        if (sum > ans) {\n            ans = sum;\n            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < 0) {\n            sum = 0;\n            minus_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
