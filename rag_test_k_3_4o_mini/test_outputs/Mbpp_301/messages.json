Note that there may be several maximum-length paths.\n    In the above path, we could replace node 6 with node 5\n    to obtain another path with length 4.\n\n    Next we will discuss two $O(n)$ time algorithms\n    for calculating the diameter of a tree.\n    The first algorithm is based on dynamic programming,\n    and the second algorithm uses two depth-first searches.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    A general way to approach many tree problems\n    is to first root the tree arbitrarily.\n    After this, we can try to solve the problem\n    separately for each subtree.\n    Our first algorithm for calculating the diameter\n    is based on this idea.\n\n    An important observation is that every path\n    in a rooted tree has a \\emph{highest point}:\n    the highest node that belongs to the path.\n    Thus, we can calculate for each node the length\n    of the longest path whose highest point is the node.\n    One of those paths corresponds to the diameter of the tree.\n\n    For example, in the following tree,\n    node 1 is the highest point on the path\n    that corresponds to the diameter:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]\n    \\node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,1) {$4$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (3) at (-2,1) {$2$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (4) at (0,1) {$3$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (5) at (2,-1) {$7$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (6) at (-3,-1) {$5$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (7) at (-1,-1) {$6$};\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);\n\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    We calculate for each node $x$ two values:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\texttt{toLeaf}(x)$: the maximum length of a path from $x$ to any leaf\n    \\item $\\texttt{maxLength}(x)$: the maximum length of a path\n    whose highest point is $x$\n    \\end{itemize}\n    For example, in the above tree,\n    $\\texttt{toLeaf}(1)=2$, because there is a path\n    $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 6$,\n    and $\\texttt{maxLength}(1)=4$,\n    because there is a path\n    $6 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 7$.\n    In this case, $\\texttt{maxLength}(1)$ equals the diameter.\n\n    Dynamic programming can be used to calculate the above\n    values for all nodes in $O(n)$ time.\n    First, to calculate $\\texttt{toLeaf}(x)$,\n    we go through the children of $x$,\n    choose a child $c$ with maximum $\\texttt{toLeaf}(c)$\n    and add one to this value.\n    Then, to calculate $\\texttt{maxLength}(x)$,\n    we choose two distinct children $a$ and $b$\n    such that the sum $\\texttt{toLeaf}(a)+\\texttt{toLeaf}(b)$\n    is maximum and add two to this sum.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    Another efficient way to calculate the diameter\n    of a tree is based on two depth-first searches.\n    First, we choose an arbitrary node $a$ in the tree\n    and find the farthest node $b$ from $a$.\n    Then, we find the farthest node $c$ from $b$.\n    The diameter of the tree is the distance between $b$ and $c$.\n\n    In the following graph, $a$, $b$ and $c$ could be:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]\n    \\node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,3) {$4$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (3) at (0,1) {$2$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (4) at (2,1) {$3$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (5) at (4,1) {$7$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (6) at (-2,3) {$5$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (7) at (-2,1) {$6$};\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);\n    \\node[color=red] at (2,1.6) {$a$};\n    \\node[color=red] at (-2,1.6) {$b$};\n    \\node[color=red] at (4,1.6) {$c$};\n\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    This is an elegant method, but why does it work?\n\n    It helps to draw the tree differently so that\n    the path that corresponds to the diameter\n    is horizontal, and all other\n    nodes hang from it:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]\n

circle] (5) at (6,1) {$7$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (6) at (0,-1) {$5$};\n    \\node[draw, circle] (7) at (-2,1) {$6$};\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);\n    \\node[color=red] at (2,-1.6) {$a$};\n    \\node[color=red] at (-2,1.6) {$b$};\n    \\node[color=red] at (6,1.6) {$c$};\n    \\node[color=red] at (2,1.6) {$x$};\n\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);\n    \\path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Node $x$ indicates the place where the path\n    from node $a$ joins the path that corresponds\n    to the diameter.\n    The farthest node from $a$\n    is node $b$, node $c$ or some other node\n    that is at least as far from node $x$.\n    Thus, this node is always a valid choice for\n    an endpoint of a path that corresponds to the diameter.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Longest increasing subsequence\n    Part: 3/3\n    ```\n\n    ### Restoring the subsequence\n\n    It is also possible to restore the subsequence using this approach.\n    This time we have to maintain two auxiliary arrays.\n    One that tells us the index of the elements in $d[]$.\n    And again we have to create an array of \"ancestors\" $p[i]$.\n    $p[i]$ will be the index of the previous element for the optimal subsequence ending in element $i$.\n\n    It's easy to maintain these two arrays in the course of iteration over the array $a[]$ alongside the computations of $d[]$.\n    And at the end it is not difficult to restore the desired subsequence using these arrays.\n\n    ## Solution in $O(n \\log n)$ with data structures {data-toc-label=\"Solution in O(n log n) with data structures\"}\n\n    Instead of the above method for computing the longest increasing subsequence in $O(n \\log n)$ we can also solve the problem in a different way: using some simple data structures.\n\n    Let's go back to the first method.\n    Remember that $d[i]$ is the value $d[j] + 1$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.\n\n    Thus if we define an additional array $t[]$ such that\n\n    $$t[a[i]] = d[i],$$\n\n    then the problem of computing the value $d[i]$ is equivalent to finding the **maximum value in a prefix** of the array $t[]$:\n\n    $$d[i] = \\max\\left(t[0 \\dots a[i] - 1] + 1\\right)$$\n\n    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. \n    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).\n\n    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:\n    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.\n    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).\n    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.\n\n    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:\n    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.\n    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).\n\n    ## Related tasks\n\n    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence\n\n    This is in fact nearly the same problem.\n    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.\n\n    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.\n    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.\n\n    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences\n\n    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.\n    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.\n\n    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.\n    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.\n\n    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.\n\n    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence\n\n    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \\dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.\n\n    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n    **Proof**:\n    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.\n\n    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.\n    We need to prove that $x = y$.\n\n    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.\n    Therefore we have $y \\ge x$.\n\n    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.\n    Suppose that $y > x$.\n    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.\n    We transform this in set in the following way:\n    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.\n    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.\n    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.\n\n    Thus it follows that $y = x$.\n\n    **Restoring the sequences**:\n    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.\n    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Tree algorithms\n    Section: Tree traversal\n

(u != e) dfs(u, s);\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function is given two parameters: the current node $s$\n    and the previous node $e$.\n    The purpose of the parameter $e$ is to make sure\n    that the search only moves to nodes\n    that have not been visited yet.\n\n    The following function call starts the search\n    at node $x$:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    dfs(x, 0);\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    In the first call $e=0$, because there is no\n    previous node, and it is allowed\n    to proceed to any direction in the tree.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Dynamic programming}\n\n    Dynamic programming can be used to calculate\n    some information during a tree traversal.\n    Using dynamic programming, we can, for example,\n    calculate in $O(n)$ time for each node of a rooted tree the\n    number of nodes in its subtree\n    or the length of the longest path from the node\n    to a leaf.\n\n    As an example, let us calculate for each node $s$\n    a value $\\texttt{count}[s]$: the number of nodes in its subtree.\n    The subtree contains the node itself and\n    all nodes in the subtrees of its children,\n    so we can calculate the number of nodes\n    recursively using the following code:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    void dfs(int s, int e) {\n        count[s] = 1;\n        for (auto u : adj[s]) {\n            if (u == e) continue;\n            dfs(u, s);\n            count[s] += count[u];\n        }\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The depth is defined as the maximum level of nesting within the dictionary. For example, in the dictionary `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`, the depth is 4 because the innermost dictionary is nested 4 levels deep.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: \n   To find the depth of a dictionary, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to check each key-value pair in the dictionary. If the value is another dictionary, we recursively calculate its depth and keep track of the maximum depth found. If the value is not a dictionary, we simply return the current depth level. The overall depth will be the maximum depth found among all the nested dictionaries plus one for the current level.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function dict_depth(d):\n       if d is not a dictionary:\n           return 0\n       max_depth = 0\n       for each key in d:\n           depth = dict_depth(d[key])\n           if depth > max_depth:\n               max_depth = depth\n       return max_depth + 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef dict_depth(d):\n    # Base case: if d is not a dictionary, return 0\n    if not isinstance(d, dict):\n        return 0\n    \n    max_depth = 0  # Initialize maximum depth\n    # Iterate through each key in the dictionary\n    for key in d:\n        # Recursively calculate the depth of the value\n        depth = dict_depth(d[key])\n        # Update max_depth if the current depth is greater\n        if depth > max_depth:\n            max_depth = depth\n            \n    # Return the maximum depth found plus one for the current level\n    return max_depth + 1\n```"
