INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/301 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates how deep a dictionary is nested. The depth is defined as the number of levels of nested dictionaries. For example, in the dictionary `{'a':1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`, the depth is 4 because there are four levels of nesting.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the depth of a dictionary, we can use a recursive approach. We will check each key-value pair in the dictionary. If the value is another dictionary, we will call the function recursively on that value to find its depth. We will keep track of the maximum depth found during these recursive calls and return the highest depth plus one for the current level.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function dict_depth(d):
       if d is not a dictionary:
           return 0
       max_depth = 0
       for each key-value pair in d:
           if value is a dictionary:
               depth = dict_depth(value)
               if depth > max_depth:
                   max_depth = depth
       return max_depth + 1

    \section{Diameter}

    \index{diameter}

    The \key{diameter} of a tree
    is the maximum length of a path between two nodes.
    For example, consider the following tree:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,3) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (0,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (2,1) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (4,1) {$7$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (-2,3) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (7) at (-2,1) {$6$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    The diameter of this tree is 4,
    which corresponds to the following path:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,3) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (0,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (2,1) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (4,1) {$7$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (-2,3) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (7) at (-2,1) {$6$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);

    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Note that there may be several maximum-length paths.
    In the above path, we could replace node 6 with node 5
    to obtain another path with length 4.

    Next we will discuss two $O(n)$ time algorithms
    for calculating the diameter of a tree.
    The first algorithm is based on dynamic programming,
    and the second algorithm uses two depth-first searches.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    A general way to approach many tree problems
    is to first root the tree arbitrarily.
    After this, we can try to solve the problem
    separately for each subtree.
    Our first algorithm for calculating the diameter
    is based on this idea.

    An important observation is that every path
    in a rooted tree has a \emph{highest point}:
    the highest node that belongs to the path.
    Thus, we can calculate for each node the length
    of the longest path whose highest point is the node.
    One of those paths corresponds to the diameter of the tree.

    For example, in the following tree,
    node 1 is the highest point on the path
    that corresponds to the diameter:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (-2,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (0,1) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (2,-1) {$7$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (-3,-1) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (7) at (-1,-1) {$6$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);

    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    We calculate for each node $x$ two values:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\texttt{toLeaf}(x)$: the maximum length of a path from $x$ to any leaf
    \item $\texttt{maxLength}(x)$: the maximum length of a path
    whose highest point is $x$
    \end{itemize}
    For example, in the above tree,
    $\texttt{toLeaf}(1)=2$, because there is a path
    $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 6$,
    and $\texttt{maxLength}(1)=4$,
    because there is a path
    $6 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 7$.
    In this case, $\texttt{maxLength}(1)$ equals the diameter.

    Dynamic programming can be used to calculate the above
    values for all nodes in $O(n)$ time.
    First, to calculate $\texttt{toLeaf}(x)$,
    we go through the children of $x$,
    choose a child $c$ with maximum $\texttt{toLeaf}(c)$
    and add one to this value.
    Then, to calculate $\texttt{maxLength}(x)$,
    we choose two distinct children $a$ and $b$
    such that the sum $\texttt{toLeaf}(a)+\texttt{toLeaf}(b)$
    is maximum and add two to this sum.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    Another efficient way to calculate the diameter
    of a tree is based on two depth-first searches.
    First, we choose an arbitrary node $a$ in the tree
    and find the farthest node $b$ from $a$.
    Then, we find the farthest node $c$ from $b$.
    The diameter of the tree is the distance between $b$ and $c$.

    In the following graph, $a$, $b$ and $c$ could be:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,3) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (0,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (2,1) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (4,1) {$7$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (-2,3) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (7) at (-2,1) {$6$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);
    \node[color=red] at (2,1.6) {$a$};
    \node[color=red] at (-2,1.6) {$b$};
    \node[color=red] at (4,1.6) {$c$};

    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    This is an elegant method, but why does it work?

    It helps to draw the tree differently so that
    the path that corresponds to the diameter
    is horizontal, and all other
    nodes hang from it:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (2,1) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (4,1) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (0,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (2,-1) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (6,1) {$7$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (0,-1) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (7) at (-2,1) {$6$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);
    \node[color=red] at (2,-1.6) {$a$};
    \node[color=red] at (-2,1.6) {$b$};
    \node[color=red] at (6,1.6) {$c$};
    \node[color=red] at (2,1.6) {$x$};

    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (7) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (3) -- (1);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-,color=red,line width=2pt] (2) -- (5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    Node $x$ indicates the place where the path
    from node $a$ joins the path that corresponds
    to the diameter.
    The farthest node from $a$
    is node $b$, node $c$ or some other node
    that is at least as far from node $x$.
    Thus, this node is always a valid choice for
    an endpoint of a path that corresponds to the diameter.

    ### Restoring the subsequence

    It is also possible to restore the subsequence using this approach.
    This time we have to maintain two auxiliary arrays.
    One that tells us the index of the elements in $d[]$.
    And again we have to create an array of "ancestors" $p[i]$.
    $p[i]$ will be the index of the previous element for the optimal subsequence ending in element $i$.

    It's easy to maintain these two arrays in the course of iteration over the array $a[]$ alongside the computations of $d[]$.
    And at the end it is not difficult to restore the desired subsequence using these arrays.

    ## Solution in $O(n \log n)$ with data structures {data-toc-label="Solution in O(n log n) with data structures"}

    Instead of the above method for computing the longest increasing subsequence in $O(n \log n)$ we can also solve the problem in a different way: using some simple data structures.

    Let's go back to the first method.
    Remember that $d[i]$ is the value $d[j] + 1$ with $j < i$ and $a[j] < a[i]$.

    Thus if we define an additional array $t[]$ such that

    $$t[a[i]] = d[i],$$

    then the problem of computing the value $d[i]$ is equivalent to finding the **maximum value in a prefix** of the array $t[]$:

    $$d[i] = \max\left(t[0 \dots a[i] - 1] + 1\right)$$

    The problem of finding the maximum of a prefix of an array (which changes) is a standard problem that can be solved by many different data structures. 
    For instance we can use a [Segment tree](../data_structures/segment_tree.md) or a [Fenwick tree](../data_structures/fenwick.md).

    This method has obviously some **shortcomings**:
    in terms of length and complexity of the implementation this approach will be worse than the method using binary search.
    In addition if the input numbers $a[i]$ are especially large, then we would have to use some tricks, like compressing the numbers (i.e. renumber them from $0$ to $n-1$), or use a dynamic segment tree (only generate the branches of the tree that are important).
    Otherwise the memory consumption will be too high.

    On the other hand this method has also some **advantages**:
    with this method you don't have to think about any tricky properties in the dynamic programming solution.
    And this approach allows us to generalize the problem very easily (see below).

    ## Related tasks

    Here are several problems that are closely related to the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence.

    ### Longest non-decreasing subsequence

    This is in fact nearly the same problem.
    Only now it is allowed to use identical numbers in the subsequence.

    The solution is essentially also nearly the same.
    We just have to change the inequality signs, and make a slightly modification to the binary search.

    ### Number of longest increasing subsequences

    We can use the first discussed method, either the $O(n^2)$ version or the version using data structures.
    We only have to additionally store in how many ways we can obtain longest increasing subsequences ending in the values $d[i]$.

    The number of ways to form a longest increasing subsequences ending in $a[i]$ is the sum of all ways for all longest increasing subsequences ending in $j$ where $d[j]$ is maximal.
    There can be multiple such $j$, so we need to sum all of them.

    Using a Segment tree this approach can also be implemented in $O(n \log n)$.

    It is not possible to use the binary search approach for this task.

    ### Smallest number of non-increasing subsequences covering a sequence

    For a given array with $n$ numbers $a[0 \dots n - 1]$ we have to colorize the numbers in the smallest number of colors, so that each color forms a non-increasing subsequence.

    To solve this, we notice that the minimum number of required colors is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

    **Proof**:
    We need to prove the **duality** of these two problems.

    Let's denote by $x$ the length of the longest increasing subsequence and by $y$ the least number of non-increasing subsequences that form a cover.
    We need to prove that $x = y$.

    It is clear that $y < x$ is not possible, because if we have $x$ strictly increasing elements, than no two can be part of the same non-increasing subsequence.
    Therefore we have $y \ge x$.

    We now show that $y > x$ is not possible by contradiction.
    Suppose that $y > x$.
    Then we consider any optimal set of $y$ non-increasing subsequences.
    We transform this in set in the following way:
    as long as there are two such subsequences such that the first begins before the second subsequence, and the first sequence start with a number greater than or equal to the second, then we unhook this starting number and attach it to the beginning of second.
    After a finite number of steps we have $y$ subsequences, and their starting numbers will form an increasing subsequence of length $y$.
    Since we assumed that $y > x$ we reached a contradiction.

    Thus it follows that $y = x$.

    **Restoring the sequences**:
    The desired partition of the sequence into subsequences can be done greedily.
    I.e. go from left to right and assign the current number or that subsequence ending with the minimal number which is greater than or equal to the current one.

    \index{tree}

    A \key{tree} is a connected, acyclic graph
    that consists of $n$ nodes and $n-1$ edges.
    Removing any edge from a tree divides it
    into two components,
    and adding any edge to a tree creates a cycle.
    Moreover, there is always a unique path between any
    two nodes of a tree.

    For example, the following tree consists of 8 nodes and 7 edges:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (1) at (0,3) {$1$};
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (2,3) {$4$};
    \node[draw, circle] (3) at (0,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (4) at (2,1) {$3$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (4,1) {$7$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (-2,3) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (7) at (-2,1) {$6$};
    \node[draw, circle] (8) at (-4,1) {$8$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (2);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (3);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (1) -- (4);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (3) -- (7);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (7) -- (8);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \index{leaf}

    The \key{leaves} of a tree are the nodes
    with degree 1, i.e., with only one neighbor.
    For example, the leaves of the above tree
    are nodes 3, 5, 7 and 8.

    \index{root}
    \index{rooted tree}

    In a \key{rooted} tree, one of the nodes
    is appointed the \key{root} of the tree,
    and all other nodes are
    placed underneath the root.
    For example, in the following tree,
    node 1 is the root node.

    \index{child}
    \index{parent}

    In a rooted tree, the \key{children} of a node
    are its lower neighbors, and the \key{parent} of a node
    is its upper neighbor.
    Each node has exactly one parent,
    except for the root that does not have a parent.
    For example, in the above tree,
    the children of node 2 are nodes 5 and 6,
    and its parent is node 1.

    \index{subtree}

    The structure of a rooted tree is \emph{recursive}:
    each node of the tree acts as the root of a \key{subtree}
    that contains the node itself and all nodes
    that are in the subtrees of its children.
    For example, in the above tree, the subtree of node 2
    consists of nodes 2, 5, 6 and 8:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
    \node[draw, circle] (2) at (-2,1) {$2$};
    \node[draw, circle] (5) at (-3,-1) {$5$};
    \node[draw, circle] (6) at (-1,-1) {$6$};
    \node[draw, circle] (8) at (-1,-3) {$8$};
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (5);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (2) -- (6);
    \path[draw,thick,-] (6) -- (8);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \section{Tree traversal}

    General graph traversal algorithms
    can be used to traverse the nodes of a tree.
    However, the traversal of a tree is easier to implement than
    that of a general graph, because
    there are no cycles in the tree and it is not
    possible to reach a node from multiple directions.

    The typical way to traverse a tree is to start
    a depth-first search at an arbitrary node.
    The following recursive function can be used:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    void dfs(int s, int e) {
        // process node s
        for (auto u : adj[s]) {
            if (u != e) dfs(u, s);
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function is given two parameters: the current node $s$
    and the previous node $e$.
    The purpose of the parameter $e$ is to make sure
    that the search only moves to nodes
    that have not been visited yet.

    The following function call starts the search
    at node $x$:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    dfs(x, 0);
    \end{lstlisting}

    In the first call $e=0$, because there is no
    previous node, and it is allowed
    to proceed to any direction in the tree.

    \subsubsection{Dynamic programming}

    Dynamic programming can be used to calculate
    some information during a tree traversal.
    Using dynamic programming, we can, for example,
    calculate in $O(n)$ time for each node of a rooted tree the
    number of nodes in its subtree
    or the length of the longest path from the node
    to a leaf.

    As an example, let us calculate for each node $s$
    a value $\texttt{count}[s]$: the number of nodes in its subtree.
    The subtree contains the node itself and
    all nodes in the subtrees of its children,
    so we can calculate the number of nodes
    recursively using the following code:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    void dfs(int s, int e) {
        count[s] = 1;
        for (auto u : adj[s]) {
            if (u == e) continue;
            dfs(u, s);
            count[s] += count[u];
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/301 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the depth of a nested dictionary. The depth is defined as the maximum level of nesting within the dictionary. For example, in the dictionary `{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': {'d': {}}}}`, the depth is 4 because the innermost dictionary is nested 4 levels deep.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: 
   To find the depth of a dictionary, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to check each key-value pair in the dictionary. If the value is another dictionary, we recursively calculate its depth and keep track of the maximum depth found. If the value is not a dictionary, we simply return the current depth level. The overall depth will be the maximum depth found among all the nested dictionaries plus one for the current level.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function dict_depth(d):
       if d is not a dictionary:
           return 0
       max_depth = 0
       for each key in d:
           depth = dict_depth(d[key])
           if depth > max_depth:
               max_depth = depth
       return max_depth + 1
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def dict_depth(d):
    # Base case: if d is not a dictionary, return 0
    if not isinstance(d, dict):
        return 0
    
    max_depth = 0  # Initialize maximum depth
    # Iterate through each key in the dictionary
