INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/237 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input and returns a dictionary. This dictionary should map each unique tuple to the number of times it appears in the input list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of tuples and keep track of how many times each tuple appears. We can use a dictionary to store the tuples as keys and their counts as values. For each tuple in the list, we will check if it is already in the dictionary. If it is, we will increment its count; if it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, we will return the dictionary.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function check_occurences(tuples_list):
       create an empty dictionary called occurrences
       for each tuple in tuples_list:
           if tuple is in occurrences:
               increment occurrences[tuple] by 1
           else:
               set occurrences[tuple] to 1
       return occurrences
   ```

        else:
            # Add the tuple to the dictionary with a count of 1
            occurrences[tup] = 1

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    Title: Finding repetitions
    Part: 2/2
    Then the length $k_1$ will be defined as the largest number of characters before the position $cntr$ (inclusive) that coincide with the last characters of the string $u$.
    And the length $k_2$ will be defined as the largest number of characters starting at $cntr + 1$ that coincide with the characters of the string $v$.

    Thus we can find the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ by computing the Z-function for the strings $\overline{u} + \# + \overline{v}$ and $v$.

    After that we can find the repetitions by looking at all positions $cntr$, and use the same criterion as we had for left crossing repetitions.

    ### Implementation

    The implementation of the Main-Lorentz algorithm finds all repetitions in form of peculiar tuples of size four: $(cntr,~ l,~ k_1,~ k_2)$ in $O(n \log n)$ time.
    If you only want to find the number of repetitions in a string, or only want to find the longest repetition in a string, this information is enough and the runtime will still be $O(n \log n)$.

    Notice that if you want to expand these tuples to get the starting and end position of each repetition, then the runtime will be the runtime will be $O(n^2)$ (remember that there can be $O(n^2)$ repetitions).
    In this implementation we will do so, and store all found repetition in a vector of pairs of start and end indices.

    ```{.cpp file=main_lorentz}
    vector<int> z_function(string const& s) {
        int n = s.size();

            if (i <= r)
                z[i] = min(r-i+1, z[i-l]);
            while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i+z[i]])
                z[i]++;
            if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
                l = i;
                r = i + z[i] - 1;

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 2/4
    ```

    This is an **online** algorithm, i.e. it processes the data as it arrives - for example, you can read the string characters one by one and process them immediately, finding the value of prefix function for each next character.
    The algorithm still requires storing the string itself and the previously calculated values of prefix function, but if we know beforehand the maximum value $M$ the prefix function can take on the string, we can store only $M+1$ first characters of the string and the same number of values of the prefix function.

    ## Applications

    ### Search for a substring in a string. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm

    The task is the classical application of the prefix function.

    Given a text $t$ and a string $s$, we want to find and display the positions of all occurrences of the string $s$ in the text $t$.

    For convenience we denote with $n$ the length of the string s and with $m$ the length of the text $t$.

    We generate the string $s + \# + t$, where $\#$ is a separator that appears neither in $s$ nor in $t$.
    Let us calculate the prefix function for this string.
    Now think about the meaning of the values of the prefix function, except for the first $n + 1$ entries (which belong to the string $s$ and the separator).
    By definition the value $\pi[i]$ shows the longest length of a substring ending in position $i$ that coincides with the prefix.
    But in our case this is nothing more than the largest block that coincides with $s$ and ends at position $i$.
    This length cannot be bigger than $n$ due to the separator.
    But if equality $\pi[i] = n$ is achieved, then it means that the string $s$ appears completely in at this position, i.e. it ends at position $i$.
    Just do not forget that the positions are indexed in the string $s + \# + t$.

    Thus if at some position $i$ we have $\pi[i] = n$, then at the position $i - (n + 1) - n + 1 = i - 2n$ in the string $t$ the string $s$ appears.

    As already mentioned in the description of the prefix function computation, if we know that the prefix values never exceed a certain value, then we do not need to store the entire string and the entire function, but only its beginning.
    In our case this means that we only need to store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it.
    We can read one character at a time of the string $t$ and calculate the current value of the prefix function.

    Thus the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm solves the problem in $O(n + m)$ time and $O(n)$ memory.

    ### Counting the number of occurrences of each prefix

    Here we discuss two problems at once.
    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    In the first variation of the problem we want to count the number of appearances of each prefix $s[0 \dots i]$ in the same string.
    In the second variation of the problem another string $t$ is given and we want to count the number of appearances of each prefix $s[0 \dots i]$ in $t$.

    First we solve the first problem.
    Consider the value of the prefix function $\pi[i]$ at a position $i$.
    By definition it means that the prefix of length $\pi[i]$ of the string $s$ occurs and ends at position $i$, and there is no longer prefix that follows this definition.
    At the same time shorter prefixes can end at this position.
    It is not difficult to see, that we have the same question that we already answered when we computed the prefix function itself:
    Given a prefix of length $j$ that is a suffix ending at position $i$, what is the next smaller prefix $\lt j$ that is also a suffix ending at position $i$.
    Thus at the position $i$ ends the prefix of length $\pi[i]$, the prefix of length $\pi[\pi[i] - 1]$, the prefix $\pi[\pi[\pi[i] - 1] - 1]$, and so on, until the index becomes zero.
    Thus we can compute the answer in the following way.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_count_each_prefix}
    vector<int> ans(n + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        ans[pi[i]]++;
    for (int i = n-1; i > 0; i--)
        ans[pi[i-1]] += ans[i];
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
        ans[i]++;

   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each tuple. We will iterate through the list of tuples, and for each tuple, we will check if it is already in the dictionary. If it is, we will increment its count; if it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, we will return the dictionary containing the counts of each unique tuple.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function check_occurences(tuples_list):
       create an empty dictionary called counts
       for each tuple in tuples_list:
           if tuple is in counts:
               increment counts[tuple] by 1
           else:
               set counts[tuple] to 1
       return counts
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def check_occurences(tuples_list):
    # Create an empty dictionary to store counts
    counts = {}
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the input list
    for tup in tuples_list:
        # If the tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if tup in counts:
            counts[tup] += 1
        # If the tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
        else:
            counts[tup] = 1
            
    # Return the dictionary containing counts of each unique tuple
    return counts

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/237 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to identify why the code did not pass the tests.

1. **Understanding the Expected Output**: 
   The assertion states that the function should return a dictionary mapping each unique tuple to the number of times it occurs in the list. The expected output for the input `[(3, 1), (1, 3), (2, 5), (5, 2), (6, 3)]` is `{(1, 3): 2, (2, 5): 2, (3, 6): 1}`. This indicates that the tuples `(1, 3)` and `(2, 5)` should be counted twice, while `(3, 6)` should be counted once.

2. **Identifying the Mistake**: 
   The mistake in the previous solution is that it does not account for the fact that tuples `(3, 1)` and `(1, 3)` are considered the same for counting purposes. The function should treat tuples as unordered pairs, meaning `(a, b)` is equivalent to `(b, a)`. Therefore, when counting occurrences, we need to ensure that we are counting both `(3, 1)` and `(1, 3)` as the same tuple.

3. **Correcting the Approach**: 
   To fix this, we can sort the elements of each tuple before counting them. By sorting, we can ensure that `(3, 1)` and `(1, 3)` are both represented as `(1, 3)`. This way, we can accurately count the occurrences of each unique unordered pair.

Now, let's implement this corrected logic in the code. 

```python
def check_occurences(tuples_list):
    # Create an empty dictionary to store counts
    counts = {}
    
    # Iterate through each tuple in the input list
    for tup in tuples_list:
        # Sort the tuple to treat (a, b) and (b, a) as the same
        sorted_tup = tuple(sorted(tup))
        
        # If the sorted tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if sorted_tup in counts:
            counts[sorted_tup] += 1
        # If the sorted tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
        else:
            counts[sorted_tup] = 1
            
    # Return the dictionary containing counts of each unique tuple
    return counts
```

    Chapter: Data structures
    Section: Comparison to sorting
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Comparison to sorting}

    It is often possible to solve a problem
    using either data structures or sorting.
    Sometimes there are remarkable differences
    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,
    which may be hidden in their time complexities.

    Let us consider a problem where
    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$
    that both contain $n$ elements.
    Our task is to calculate the number of elements
    that belong to both of the lists.
    For example, for the lists
    \[A = [5,2,8,9] \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\]
    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5
    and 9 belong to both of the lists.

    A straightforward solution to the problem is
    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,
    but next we will focus on
    more efficient algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,
    and after this, we iterate through the elements
    of $B$ and check for each elements if it
    also belongs to $A$.
    This is efficient because the elements of $A$
    are in a set.
    Using the \texttt{set} structure,
    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,
    so instead of the \texttt{set} structure
    we can also use the \texttt{unordered\_set} structure.
    This is an easy way to make the algorithm
    more efficient, because we only have to change
    the underlying data structure.
    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.
    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.
    After this, we iterate through both the lists
    at the same time and find the common elements.
    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n)$,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    so the total time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    The following table shows how efficient
    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and
    the elements of the lists are random
    integers between $1 \ldots 10^9$:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\
    $2 \cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\
    $3 \cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\
    $4 \cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\
    $5 \cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that
    they use different set structures.
    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on
    the running time, because Algorithm 2
    is 4â€“5 times faster than Algorithm 1.

    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3
    which uses sorting.
    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.
    Interestingly, the time complexity of both
    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \log n)$,
    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.
    This can be explained by the fact that
    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done
    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.
    On the other hand,
    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree
    during the whole algorithm.

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    Title: Finding repetitions
    Part: 2/2
    Then the length $k_1$ will be defined as the largest number of characters before the position $cntr$ (inclusive) that coincide with the last characters of the string $u$.
    And the length $k_2$ will be defined as the largest number of characters starting at $cntr + 1$ that coincide with the characters of the string $v$.

    Thus we can find the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ by computing the Z-function for the strings $\overline{u} + \# + \overline{v}$ and $v$.

    After that we can find the repetitions by looking at all positions $cntr$, and use the same criterion as we had for left crossing repetitions.

    ### Implementation

    The implementation of the Main-Lorentz algorithm finds all repetitions in form of peculiar tuples of size four: $(cntr,~ l,~ k_1,~ k_2)$ in $O(n \log n)$ time.
    If you only want to find the number of repetitions in a string, or only want to find the longest repetition in a string, this information is enough and the runtime will still be $O(n \log n)$.

    Notice that if you want to expand these tuples to get the starting and end position of each repetition, then the runtime will be the runtime will be $O(n^2)$ (remember that there can be $O(n^2)$ repetitions).
    In this implementation we will do so, and store all found repetition in a vector of pairs of start and end indices.

    ```{.cpp file=main_lorentz}
    vector<int> z_function(string const& s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> z(n);
        for (int i = 1, l = 0, r = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i <= r)
                z[i] = min(r-i+1, z[i-l]);
            while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i+z[i]])
                z[i]++;
            if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
                l = i;
                r = i + z[i] - 1;
            }
        }
        return z;
    }

    int get_z(vector<int> const& z, int i) {
        if (0 <= i && i < (int)z.size())
            return z[i];
        else
            return 0;
    }

    vector<pair<int, int>> repetitions;

    void convert_to_repetitions(int shift, bool left, int cntr, int l, int k1, int k2) {
        for (int l1 = max(1, l - k2); l1 <= min(l, k1); l1++) {
            if (left && l1 == l) break;
            int l2 = l - l1;
            int pos = shift + (left ? cntr - l1 : cntr - l - l1 + 1);
            repetitions.emplace_back(pos, pos + 2*l - 1);
        }
    }

    void find_repetitions(string s, int shift = 0) {
        int n = s.size();
        if (n == 1)
            return;

        int nu = n / 2;
        int nv = n - nu;
        string u = s.substr(0, nu);
        string v = s.substr(nu);
        string ru(u.rbegin(), u.rend());
        string rv(v.rbegin(), v.rend());

        find_repetitions(u, shift);
        find_repetitions(v, shift + nu);

        vector<int> z1 = z_function(ru);

        vector<int> z3 = z_function(ru + '#' + rv);
        vector<int> z4 = z_function(v);

            } else {
                l = cntr - nu + 1;
                k1 = get_z(z3, nu + 1 + nv - 1 - (cntr - nu));
                k2 = get_z(z4, (cntr - nu) + 1);
            }
            if (k1 + k2 >= l)
                convert_to_repetitions(shift, cntr < nu, cntr, l, k1, k2);
