    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples and counts how many times each unique tuple appears in that list. The output should be a dictionary where the keys are the unique tuples and the values are their respective counts.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of the Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each tuple. We will iterate through the list of tuples, and for each tuple, we will check if it is already in the dictionary. If it is, we will increment its count; if it is not, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1. Finally, we will return the dictionary containing the counts of each unique tuple.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_occurences(tuples_list):\n       create an empty dictionary called counts\n       for each tuple in tuples_list:\n           if tuple is in counts:\n               increment counts[tuple] by 1\n           else:\n               set counts[tuple] to 1\n       return counts\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef check_occurences(tuples_list):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store counts\n    counts = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the input list\n    for tup in tuples_list:\n        # If the tuple is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if tup in counts:\n            counts[tup] += 1\n        # If the tuple is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n        else:\n            counts[tup] = 1\n            \n    # Return the dictionary containing counts of each unique tuple\n    return counts\n```",
