    "raw_msg": "After reviewing the problem and the provided memories, I realize that the expected output for the function `Diff` is not simply the elements from the first list that are not in the second list. Instead, the output should also maintain the order of the elements that are not in the second list, but it should also include the elements that were originally in the first list and were not filtered out.\n\nThe expected output for the test case indicates that the elements should be returned in the order they appear in the first list, but with the elements that are in the second list removed. The output should include the elements from the first list that are not in the second list, but it should also include the elements that were originally in the first list and were not filtered out.\n\nTo achieve this, I will:\n1. Create a result list.\n2. Iterate through the first list and check if each element is in the second list.\n3. If an element is not in the second list, I will add it to the result list.\n4. Finally, I will return the result list.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Create a set from list2 for faster lookup\n    set_list2 = set(list2)\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not in the second list\n        if element not in set_list2:\n            # If not, add it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the final result list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly return the elements from the first list that are not in the second list while maintaining the order specified in the test case.",
