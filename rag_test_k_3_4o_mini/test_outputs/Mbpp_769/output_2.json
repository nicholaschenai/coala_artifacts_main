    "raw_msg": "Given the insights from the previous analysis and the requirements of the problem, I realize that the output should not only contain the elements from the first list that are not in the second list but also maintain a specific order. The expected output for the test case indicates that the elements should be returned in the order they appear in the first list, but with the elements that are in the second list removed.\n\nTo achieve this, I will:\n1. Create a result list.\n2. Iterate through the first list and check if each element is in the second list.\n3. If an element is not in the second list, I will add it to the result list.\n4. The order of the elements in the result list will be the same as their order in the first list.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    # Create an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Create a set from list2 for faster lookup\n    set_list2 = set(list2)\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not in the second list\n        if element not in set_list2:\n            # If not, add it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the final result list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly return the elements from the first list that are not in the second list while maintaining the order specified in the test case.",
