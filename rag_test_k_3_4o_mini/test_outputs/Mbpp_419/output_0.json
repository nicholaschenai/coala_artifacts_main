    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of floating-point numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, sums these rounded integers, and then multiplies the sum by the number of elements in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - First, we will iterate through the list of numbers.\n   - For each number, we will round it to the nearest integer using Python's built-in `round()` function.\n   - We will keep a running total of these rounded integers.\n   - After processing all numbers, we will multiply the total sum by the length of the list.\n   - Finally, we will return this final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function round_and_sum(numbers):\n       total_sum = 0\n       for each number in numbers:\n           rounded_number = round(number)\n           total_sum += rounded_number\n       result = total_sum * length of numbers\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef round_and_sum(numbers):\n    # Initialize the total sum to zero\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Round the number to the nearest integer\n        rounded_number = round(number)\n        # Add the rounded number to the total sum\n        total_sum += rounded_number\n    \n    # Multiply the total sum by the length of the list\n    result = total_sum * len(numbers)\n    \n    # Return the final result\n    return result\n```",
