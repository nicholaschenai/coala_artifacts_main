Pick's theorem provides a way to compute the area of this polygon through the number of vertices that are lying on the boundary and the number of vertices that lie strictly inside the polygon.\n\n    ## Formula\n\n    Given a certain lattice polygon with non-zero area.\n\n    We denote its area by $S$, the number of points with integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon by $I$ and the number of points lying on polygon sides by $B$.\n\n    Then, the **Pick's formula** states:\n\n    $$S=I+\\frac{B}{2}-1$$\n\n    In particular, if the values of $I$ and $B$ for a polygon are given, the area can be calculated in $O(1)$ without even knowing the vertices.\n\n    This formula was discovered and proven by Austrian mathematician Georg Alexander Pick in 1899.\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    The proof is carried out in many stages: from simple polygons to arbitrary ones:\n\n    - A single square: $S=1, I=0, B=4$, which satisfies the formula.\n\n    - An arbitrary non-degenerate rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes: Assume $a$ and $b$ be the length of the sides of rectangle. Then, $S=ab, I=(a-1)(b-1), B=2(a+b)$. On substituting, we see that formula is true.\n\n    - A right angle with legs parallel to the axes: To prove this, note that any such triangle can be obtained by cutting off a rectangle by a diagonal. Denoting the number of integral points lying on diagonal by $c$, it can be shown that Pick's formula holds for this triangle regardless of $c$.\n\n    - An arbitrary triangle: Note that any such triangle can be turned into a rectangle by attaching it to sides of right-angled triangles with legs parallel to the axes (you will not need more than 3 such triangles). From here, we can get correct formula for any triangle.\n\n    - An arbitrary polygon: To prove this, triangulate it, ie, divide into triangles with integral coordinates. Further, it is possible to prove that Pick's theorem retains its validity when a polygon is added to a triangle. Thus, we have proven Pick's formula for arbitrary polygon.\n\n    ## Generalization to higher dimensions\n\n    Unfortunately, this simple and beautiful formula cannot be generalized to higher dimensions.\n\n    John Reeve demonstrated this by proposing a tetrahedron (**Reeve tetrahedron**) with following vertices in 1957:\n\n    $$A=(0,0,0),\n    B=(1,0,0),\n    C=(0,1,0),\n    D=(1,1,k),$$\n\n    where $k$ can be any natural number. Then for any $k$, the tetrahedron $ABCD$ does not contain integer point inside it and has only $4$ points on its borders, $A, B, C, D$. Thus, the volume and surface area may vary in spite of unchanged number of points within and on boundary. Therefore, Pick's theorem doesn't allow generalizations.\n\n    However, higher dimensions still has a generalization using **Ehrhart polynomials** but they are quite complex and depends not only on points inside but also on the boundary of polytype.\n\n    ## Extra Resources\n    A few simple examples and a simple proof of Pick's theorem can be found [here](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/pick.pdf).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Introduction\n    Section: Mathematics\n    Part: 1/2\n    \\section{Mathematics}\n\n    Mathematics plays an important role in competitive\n    programming, and it is not possible to become\n    a successful competitive programmer without\n    having good mathematical skills.\n    This section discusses some important\n    mathematical concepts and formulas that\n    are needed later in the book.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Sum formulas}\n\n    Each sum of the form\n    \\[\\sum_{x=1}^n x^k = 1^k+2^k+3^k+\\ldots+n^k,\\]\n    where $k$ is a positive integer,\n    has a closed-form formula that is a\n    polynomial of degree $k+1$.\n    For example\\footnote{\\index{Faulhaber's formula}\n    There is even a general formula for such sums, called \\key{Faulhaber's formula},\n    but it is too complex to be presented here.},\n    \\[\\sum_{x=1}^n x = 1+2+3+\\ldots+n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\]\n    and\n    \\[\\sum_{x=1}^n x^2 = 1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+n^2 = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}.\\]\n\n    An \\key{arithmetic progression} is a \\index{arithmetic progression}\n    sequence of numbers\n    where the difference between any two consecutive\n    numbers is constant.\n    For example,\n    \\[3, 7, 11, 15\\]\n    is an arithmetic progression with constant 4.\n    The sum of an arithmetic progression can be calculated\n    using the formula\n    \\[\\underbrace{a + \\cdots + b}_{n \\,\\, \\textrm{numbers}} = \\frac{n(a+b)}{2}\\]\n    where $a$ is the first number,\n    $b$ is the last number and\n    $n$ is the amount of numbers.\n    For example,\n    \\[3+7+11+15=\\frac{4 \\cdot (3+15)}{2} = 36.\\]\n    The formula is based on the fact\n    that the sum consists of $n$ numbers and\n    the value of each number is $(a+b)/2$ on average.\n\n    \\index{geometric progression}\n    A \\key{geometric progression} is a sequence\n    of numbers\n    where the ratio between any two consecutive\n    numbers is constant.\n    For example,\n    \\[3,6,12,24\\]\n    is a geometric progression with constant 2.\n    The sum of a geometric progression can be calculated\n    using the formula\n    \\[a + ak + ak^2 + \\cdots + b = \\frac{bk-a}{k-1}\\]\n    where $a$ is the first number,\n    $b$ is the last number and the\n    ratio between consecutive numbers is $k$.\n    For example,\n    \\[3+6+12+24=\\frac{24 \\cdot 2 - 3}{2-1} = 45.\\]\n\n    This formula can be derived as follows. Let\n    \\[ S = a + ak + ak^2 + \\cdots + b .\\]\n    By multiplying both sides by $k$, we get\n    \\[ kS = ak + ak^2 + ak^3 + \\cdots + bk,\\]\n    and solving the equation\n    \\[ kS-S = bk-a\\]\n    yields the formula.\n\n    A special case of a sum of a geometric progression is the formula\n    \\[1+2+4+8+\\ldots+2^{n-1}=2^n-1.\\]\n\n    \\index{harmonic sum}\n\n    A \\key{harmonic

 modify each term $1/k$ so that $k$ becomes\n    the nearest power of two that does not exceed $k$.\n    For example, when $n=6$, we can estimate\n    the sum as follows:\n    \\[ 1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{1}{6} \\le\n    1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}.\\]\n    This upper bound consists of $\\log_2(n)+1$ parts\n    ($1$, $2 \\cdot 1/2$, $4 \\cdot 1/4$, etc.),\n    and the value of each part is at most 1.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Set theory}\n\n    \\index{set theory}\n    \\index{set}\n

example, the set\n    \\[X=\\{2,4,7\\}\\]\n    contains elements 2, 4 and 7.\n    The symbol $\\emptyset$ denotes an empty set,\n    and $|S|$ denotes the size of a set $S$,\n    i.e., the number of elements in the set.\n    For example, in the above set, $|X|=3$.\n\n    If a set $S$ contains an element $x$,\n    we write $x \\in S$,\n    and otherwise we write $x \\notin S$.\n    For example, in the above set\n    \\[4 \\in X \\hspace{10px}\\textrm{and}\\hspace{10px} 5 \\notin X.\\]\n\n    \\begin{samepage}\n    New sets can be constructed using set operations:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The \\key{intersection} $A \\cap B$ consists of elements\n    that are in both $A$ and $B$.\n    For example, if $A=\\{1,2,5\\}$ and $B=\\{2,4\\}$,\n    then $A \\cap B = \\{2\\}$.\n    \\item The \\key{union} $A \\cup B$ consists of elements\n    that are in $A$ or $B$ or both.\n    For example, if $A=\\{3,7\\}$ and $B=\\{2,3,8\\}$,\n    then $A \\cup B = \\{2,3,7,8\\}$.\n    \\item The \\key{complement} $\\bar A$ consists of elements\n    that are not in $A$.\n    The interpretation of a complement depends on\n    the \\key{universal set}, which contains all possible elements.\n    For example, if $A=\\{1,2,5,7\\}$ and the universal set is\n    $\\{1,2,\\ldots,10\\}$, then $\\bar A = \\{3,4,6,8,9,10\\}$.\n    \\item The \\key{difference} $A \\setminus B = A \\cap \\bar B$\n    consists of elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.\n    Note that $B$ can contain elements that are not in $A$.\n    For example, if $A=\\{2,3,7,8\\}$ and $B=\\{3,5,8\\}$,\n    then $A \\setminus B = \\{2,7\\}$.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\end{samepage}\n\n    If each element of $A$ also belongs to $S$,\n    we say that $A$ is a \\key{subset} of $S$,\n    denoted by $A \\subset S$.\n    A set $S$ always has $2^{|S|}$ subsets,\n    including the empty set.\n    For example, the subsets of the set $\\{2,4,7\\}$ are\n    \\begin{center}\n    $\\emptyset$,\n    $\\{2\\}$, $\\{4\\}$, $\\{7\\}$, $\\{2,4\\}$, $\\{2,7\\}$, $\\{4,7\\}$ and $\\{2,4,7\\}$.\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Some often used sets are\n    $\\mathbb{N}$ (natural numbers),\n    $\\mathbb{Z}$ (integers),\n    $\\mathbb{Q}$ (rational numbers) and\n    $\\mathbb{R}$ (real numbers).\n    The set $\\mathbb{N}$\n    can be defined in two ways, depending\n    on the situation:\n    either $\\mathbb{N}=\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}$\n    or $\\mathbb{N}=\\{1,2,3,...\\}$.\n\n    We can also construct a set using a rule of the form\n    \\[\\{f(n) : n \\in S\\},\\]\n    where $f(n)$ is some function.\n    This set contains all elements of the form $f(n)$,\n    where $n$ is an element in $S$.\n    For example, the set\n    \\[X=\\{2n : n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\\]\n    contains all even integers.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Logic}\n\n    \\index{logic}\n    \\index{negation}\n    \\index{conjuction}\n    \\index{disjunction}\n    \\index{implication}\n    \\index{equivalence}\n\n    The value of a logical expression is either\n    \\key{true} (1) or \\key{false} (0).\n    The most important logical operators are\n    $\\lnot$ (\\key{negation}),\n    $\\land$ (\\key{conjunction}),\n    $\\lor$ (\\key{disjunction}),\n    $\\Rightarrow$ (\\key{implication}) and\n    $\\Leftrightarrow$ (\\key{equivalence}).\n    The following table shows the meanings of these operators:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rr|rrrrrrr}\n    $A$ & $B$ & $\\lnot A$ & $\\lnot B$ & $A \\land B$ & $A \\lor B$ & $A \\Rightarrow B$ & $A \\Leftrightarrow B$ \\\\\n    \\hline\n    0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1

the opposite value of $A$.\n    The expression $A \\land B$ is true if both $A$ and $B$\n    are true,\n    and the expression $A \\lor B$ is true if $A$ or $B$ or both\n    are true.\n    The expression $A \\Rightarrow B$ is true\n    if whenever $A$ is true, also $B$ is true.\n    The expression $A \\Leftrightarrow B$ is true\n    if $A$ and $B$ are both true or both false.\n\n    \\index{predicate}\n\n    A \\key{predicate} is an expression that is true or false\n    depending on its parameters.\n    Predicates are usually denoted by capital letters.\n    For example, we can define a predicate $P(x)$\n    that is true exactly when $x$ is a prime number.\n    Using this definition, $P(7)$ is true but $P(8)$ is false.\n\n    \\index{quantifier}\n\n    A \\key{quantifier} connects a logical expression\n    to the elements of a set.\n    The most important quantifiers are\n    $\\forall$ (\\key{for all}) and $\\exists$ (\\key{there is}).\n    For example,\n    \\[\\forall x (\\exists y (y < x))\\]\n    means that for each element $x$ in the set,\n    there is an element $y$ in the set\n    such that $y$ is smaller than $x$.\n    This is true in the set of integers,\n    but false in the set of natural numbers.\n\n    Using the notation described above,\n    we can express many kinds of logical propositions.\n    For example,\n    \\[\\forall x ((x>1 \\land \\lnot P(x)) \\Rightarrow (\\exists a (\\exists b (a > 1 \\land b > 1 \\land x = ab))))\\]\n    means that if a number $x$ is larger than 1\n    and not a prime number,\n    then there are

The lateral surface area of a cube is the total area of its four vertical sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of the Solution**: \n   - A cube has six faces, but the lateral surface area only considers the four vertical faces.\n   - Each face of the cube is a square, and the area of a square is calculated as the side length squared.\n   - Therefore, the lateral surface area can be calculated as four times the area of one face (which is the side length squared).\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function lateralsurface_cube(side_length):\n       # Calculate the area of one face\n       area_of_one_face = side_length * side_length\n       \n       # Calculate the lateral surface area (4 faces)\n       lateral_surface_area = 4 * area_of_one_face\n       \n       return lateral_surface_area\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef lateral_surface_area(side_length):\n    # Calculate the area of one face\n    area_of_one_face = side_length * side_length\n    \n    # Calculate the lateral surface area (4 faces)\n    lateral_surface_area = 4 * area_of_one_face\n    \n    return lateral_surface_area\n\ndef lateralsurface_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    return lateral_surface_area(side_length)\n```"
