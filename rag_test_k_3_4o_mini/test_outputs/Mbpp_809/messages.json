Each point $p_i$ is defined by its coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$. It is required to find among them two such points, such that the distance between them is minimal:\n\n    $$ \\min_{\\scriptstyle i, j=0 \\ldots n-1,\\atop \\scriptstyle i \\neq j } \\rho (p_i, p_j). $$\n\n    We take the usual Euclidean distances:\n\n    $$ \\rho (p_i,p_j) = \\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2} .$$\n\n    The trivial algorithm - iterating over all pairs and calculating the distance for each \u2014 works in $O(n^2)$. \n\n    The algorithm running in time $O(n \\log n)$ is described below. This algorithm was proposed by Shamos and Hoey in 1975. (Source: Ch. 5 Notes of _Algorithm Design_ by Kleinberg & Tardos, also see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4567872)) Preparata and Shamos also showed that this algorithm is optimal in the decision tree model.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n    We construct an algorithm according to the general scheme of **divide-and-conquer** algorithms: the algorithm is designed as a recursive function, to which we pass a set of points; this recursive function splits this set in half, calls itself recursively on each half, and then performs some operations to combine the answers. The operation of combining consist of  detecting the cases when one point of the optimal solution fell into one half, and the other point into the other (in this case, recursive calls from each of the halves cannot detect this pair separately). The main difficulty, as always in case of divide and conquer algorithms, lies in the effective implementation of the merging stage. If a set of $n$ points is passed to the recursive function, then the merge stage should work no more than $O(n)$, then the asymptotics of the whole algorithm $T(n)$ will be found from the equation:\n\n    $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).$$ \n\n    The solution to this equation, as is known, is $T(n) = O(n \\log n).$\n\n    So, we proceed on to the construction of the algorithm. In order to come to an effective implementation of the merge stage in the future, we will divide the set of points into two subsets, according to their $x$-coordinates: In fact, we draw some vertical line dividing the set of points into two subsets of approximately the same size. It is convenient to make such a partition as follows: We sort the points in the standard way as pairs of numbers, ie.:\n\n    $$p_i < p_j \\Longleftrightarrow (x_i < x_j) \\lor \\Big(\\left(x_i = x_j\\right) \\wedge \\left(y_i < y_j \\right) \\Big) $$\n\n    Then take the middle point after sorting $p_m (m = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor)$, and all the points before it and the $p_m$ itself are assigned to the first half, and all the points after it - to the second half:\n\n    $$A_1 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = 0 \\ldots m \\}$$\n\n    $$A_2 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = m + 1 \\ldots n-1 \\}.$$ \n\n    Now, calling recursively on each of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, we will find the answers $h_1$ and $h_2$ for each of the halves. And take the best of them: $h = \\min(h_1, h_2)$.\n\n    Now we need to make a **merge stage**, i.e. we try to find such pairs of points, for which the distance between which is less than $h$ and one point is lying in $A_1$ and the other in $A_2$.\n    It is obvious that it is sufficient to consider only those points that are separated from the vertical line by a distance less than $h$, i.e. the set $B$ of the points considered at this stage is equal to:\n\n    $$B = \\{ p_i\\ | \\ | x_i - x_m\\ | < h \\}.$$ \n\n    For each point in the set $B$, we try to find the points that are closer to it than $h$. For example, it is sufficient to consider only those points whose $y$-coordinate differs by no more than $h$. Moreover, it makes no sense to consider those points whose $y$-coordinate is greater than the $y$-coordinate of the current point. Thus, for each point $p_i$ we define the set of considered points $C(p_i)$ as follows:\n\n    $$C(p_i) = \\{ p_j\\ |\\ p_j \\in B,\\ \\ y_i - h < y_j \\le y_i \\}.$$\n\n    If we sort the points of the set $B$ by $y$-coordinate, it will be very easy to find $C(p_i)$: these are several points in a row ahead to the point $p_i$.\n\n    So, in the new notation, the **merging stage** looks like this: build a set $B$, sort the points in it by $y$-coordinate, then for each point $p_i \\in B$ consider all points $p_j \\in C(p_i)$, and for each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ calculate the distance and compare with the current best distance.\n\n    At first glance, this is still a non-optimal algorithm: it seems that the sizes of sets $C(p_i)$ will be of order $n$, and the required asymptotics will not work. However, surprisingly, it can be proved that the size of each of the sets $C(p_i)$ is a quantity $O(1)$, i.e. it does not exceed some small constant regardless of the points themselves. Proof of this fact is given in the next section.\n\n    Finally, we pay attention to the sorting, which the above algorithm contains: first,sorting by pairs $(x, y)$, and then second, sorting the elements of the set $B$ by $y$. In fact, both of these sorts inside the recursive function can be eliminated (otherwise we would not reach the $O(n)$ estimate for the **merging stage**, and the general asymptotics of the algorithm would be $O(n \\log^2 n)$). It is easy to get rid of the first sort \u2014 it is enough to perform this sort before starting the recursion: after all, the elements themselves do not change inside the recursion, so there is no need to sort again. With the second sorting a little more difficult to perform, performing it previously will not work. But, remembering the merge sort, which also works on the principle of divide-and-conquer, we can simply embed this sort in our recursion. Let recursion, taking some set of points (as we remember,ordered by pairs $(x, y)$), return the same set, but sorted by the $y$-coordinate. To do this, simply merge (in $O(n)$) the two results returned by recursive calls. This will result in a set sorted by $y$-coordinate.\n\n    ## Evaluation of the asymptotics\n\n    To show that the above algorithm is actually executed in $O(n \\log n)$, we need to prove the following fact: $|C(p_i)| = O(1)$.\n\n    So, let us consider some point $p_i$; recall that the set $C(p_i)$ is a set of points whose $y$-coordinate lies in the segment $[y_i-h; y_i]$, and, moreover, along the $x$ coordinate, the point $p_i$ itself, and all the points of the set $C(p_i)$ lie in the band width $2h$. In other words, the points we are considering $p_i$ and $C(p_i)$ lie in a rectangle of size $2h \\times h$.\n\n    Our task is to estimate the maximum number of points that can lie in this rectangle $2h \\times h$; thus, we estimate the maximum size of the set $C(p_i)$. At the same time, when evaluating, we must not forget that there may be repeated points.\n\n    Remember that $h$ was obtained from the results of two recursive calls \u2014 on sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ contains points to the left of the partition line and partially on it, $A_2$ contains the remaining points of the partition line and points to the right of it. For any pair of points from $A_1$, as well as from $A_2$, the distance can not be less than $h$ \u2014 otherwise it would mean incorrect operation of the recursive function.\n\n    To estimate the maximum number of points in the rectangle $2h \\times h$ we divide it into two squares $h \\times h$, the first square include all points $C(p_i) \\cap A_1$, and the second contains all the others, i.e. $C(p_i) \\cap A_2$. It follows from the above considerations that in each of these squares the distance between any two points is at least $h$.\n\n    We show that there are at most four points in each square. For example, this can be done as follows: divide the square into $4$ sub-squares with sides $h/2$. Then there can be no more than one point in each of these sub-squares (since even the diagonal is equal to $h / \\sqrt{2}$, which is less than $h$). Therefore, there can be no more than $4$ points in the whole square.\n\n    So, we have proved that in a rectangle $2h \\times h$ can not be more than $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ points, and, therefore, the size of the set $C(p_i)$ cannot exceed $7$, as required.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: 2-SAT\n    Part: 1/2\n    # 2-SAT \n\n    SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) is the problem of assigning Boolean values to variables to satisfy a given Boolean formula.\n    The Boolean formula will usually be given in CNF (conjunctive normal form), which is a conjunction of multiple clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals (variables or negation of variables).\n    2-SAT (2-satisfiability) is a restriction of the SAT problem, in 2-SAT every clause has exactly two literals.\n    Here is an example of such a 2-SAT problem.\n    Find an assignment of $a, b, c$ such that the following formula is true:\n\n    $$(a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (a \\lor \\lnot c)$$\n\n    SAT is NP-complete, there is no known efficient solution known for it.\n    However 2SAT can be solved efficiently in $O(n + m)$ where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$ is the number of clauses.\n\n    ## Algorithm:\n\n    First we need to convert the problem to a different form, the so-called implicative normal form.\n    Note that the expression $a \\lor b$ is equivalent to $\\lnot a \\Rightarrow b \\land \\lnot b \\Rightarrow a$ (if one of the two variables is false, then the other one must be true).\n\n    We now construct a directed graph of these implications:\n    for each variable $x$ there will be two vertices $v_x$ and $v_{\\lnot x}$.\n    The edges will correspond to the implications.\n\n    Let's look at the example in 2-CNF form:\n\n    $$(a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (a \\lor \\lnot c)$$\n\n    The oriented graph will contain the following vertices and edges:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{cccc}\n    \\lnot a \\Rightarrow \\lnot b & a \\Rightarrow b & a \\Rightarrow \\lnot b & \\lnot a \\Rightarrow \\lnot c\\\\\n    b \\Rightarrow a & \\lnot b \\Rightarrow \\lnot a & b \\Rightarrow \\lnot a & c \\Rightarrow a\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    You can see the implication graph in the following image:\n\n    <center>![\"Implication Graph of 2-SAT example\"](2SAT.png)</center>\n\n    It is worth paying attention to the property of the implication graph:\n    if there is an edge $a \\Rightarrow b$, then there also is an edge $\\lnot b \\Rightarrow \\lnot a$. \n\n    Also note, that if $x$ is reachable from $\\lnot x$, and $\\lnot x$ is reachable from $x$, then the problem has no solution.\n    Whatever value we choose for the variable $x$, it will always end in a contradiction - if $x$ will be assigned $\\text{true}$ then the implication tell us that $\\lnot x$ should also be $\\text{true}$ and visa versa.\n    It turns out, that this condition is not only necessary, but also sufficient.\n    We will prove this in a few paragraphs below.\n    First recall, if a vertex is reachable from a second one, and the second one is reachable from the first one, then these two vertices are in the same strongly connected component.\n    Therefore we can formulate the criterion for the existence of a solution as follows:\n\n    In order for this 2-SAT problem to have a solution, it is necessary and sufficient that for any variable $x$ the vertices $x$ and $\\lnot x$ are in different strongly connected components of the strong connection of the implication graph.\n\n    This criterion can be verified in $O(n + m)$ time by finding all strongly connected components.\n\n    The following image shows all strongly connected components for the example.\n    As we can check easily, neither of the four components contain a vertex $x$ and its negation $\\lnot x$, therefore the example has a solution.\n    We will learn in the next paragraphs how to compute a valid assignment, but just for demonstration purposes the solution $a = \\text{false}$, $b = \\text{false}$, $c = \\text{false}$ is given.\n\n    <center>![\"Strongly Connected Components of the 2-SAT example\"](2SAT_SCC.png)</center>\n\n    Now we construct the algorithm for finding the solution of the 2-SAT problem on the assumption that the solution exists.\n\n    Note that, in spite of the fact that the solution exists, it can happen that $\\lnot x$ is reachable from $x$ in the implication graph, or that (but not simultaneously) $x$ is reachable from $\\lnot x$.\n    In that case the choice of either $\\text{true}$ or $\\text{false}$ for $x$ will lead to a contradiction, while the choice of the other one will not.\n    Let's learn how to choose a value, such that we don't generate a contradiction.\n\n    Let us sort the strongly connected components in topological order (i.e. $\\text{comp}[v] \\le \\text{comp}[u]$ if there is a path from $v$ to $u$) and let $\\text{comp}[v]$ denote the index of strongly connected component to which the vertex $v$ belongs.\n    Then, if $\\text{comp}[x] < \\text{comp}[\\lnot x]$ we assign $x$ with $\\text{false}$ and $\\text{true}$ otherwise.\n\n    Let us prove that with this assignment of the variables we do not arrive at a contradiction.\n    Suppose $x$ is assigned with $\\text{true}$.\n    The other case can be proven in a similar way.\n\n    First we prove that the vertex $x$ cannot reach the vertex $\\lnot x$.\n    Because we assigned $\\text{true}$ it has to hold that the index of strongly connected component of $x$ is greater than the index of the component of $\\lnot x$.\n    This means that $\\lnot x$ is located on the left of the component containing $x$, and the later vertex cannot reach the first.\n\n    Secondly we prove that there doesn't exist a variable $y$, such that the vertices $y$ and $\\lnot y$ are both reachable from $x$ in the implication graph.\n    This would cause a contradiction, because $x = \\text{true}$ implies that $y = \\text{true}$ and $\\lnot y = \\text{true}$.\n    Let us prove this by contradiction.\n    Suppose that $y$ and $\\lnot y$ are both reachable from $x$, then by the property of the implication graph $\\lnot x$ is reachable from both $y$ and $\\lnot y$.\n    By transitivity this results that $\\lnot x$ is reachable by $x$, which contradicts the assumption.\n\n    So we have constructed an algorithm that finds the required values of variables under the assumption that for any variable $x$ the vertices $x$ and $\\lnot x$ are in different strongly connected components.\n    Above showed the correctness of this algorithm.\n    Consequently we simultaneously proved the above criterion for the existence of a solution.\n\n    ## Implementation:\n\n    Now we can implement the entire algorithm.\n    First we construct the graph of implications and find all strongly connected components.\n    This can be accomplished with Kosaraju's algorithm in $O(n + m)$ time.\n    In the second traversal of the graph Kosaraju's algorithm visits the strongly connected components in topological order, therefore it is easy to compute $\\text{comp}[v]$ for each vertex $v$.\n\n    Afterwards we can choose the assignment of $x$ by comparing $\\text{comp}[x]$ and $\\text{comp}[\\lnot x]$. \n    If $\\text{comp}[x] = \\text{comp}[\\lnot x]$ we return $\\text{false}$ to indicate that there doesn't exist a valid assignment that satisfies the 2-SAT problem.\n\n    Below is the implementation of the solution of the 2-SAT problem for the already constructed graph of implication $adj$ and the transpose graph $adj^{\\intercal}$ (in which the direction of each edge is reversed).\n    In the graph the vertices with indices $2k$ and $2k+1$ are the two vertices corresponding to variable $k$ with $2k+1$ corresponding to the negated variable.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=2sat}\n    int n;\n    vector<vector<int>> adj, adj_t;\n    vector<bool> used;\n    vector<int> order, comp;\n    vector<bool> assignment;\n\n    void dfs1(int v) {\n
