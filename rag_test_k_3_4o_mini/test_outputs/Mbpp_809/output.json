    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: We need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. The first tuple contains a set of numbers, and the second tuple contains another set of numbers. The function should check if every number in the second tuple is smaller than the corresponding number in the first tuple. If all numbers in the second tuple are smaller, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through both tuples simultaneously. For each pair of corresponding elements (one from the first tuple and one from the second), we will check if the element from the second tuple is smaller than the element from the first tuple. If we find any element in the second tuple that is not smaller, we will return `False`. If we finish checking all pairs and they all satisfy the condition, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n       for each index i from 0 to length of tuple1:\n           if tuple2[i] is not less than tuple1[i]:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Iterate through the indices of the tuples\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Check if the element in tuple2 is not smaller than the corresponding element in tuple1\n        if tuple2[i] >= tuple1[i]:\n            return False  # Return False if any element in tuple2 is not smaller\n    return True  # Return True if all elements in tuple2 are smaller\n```",
