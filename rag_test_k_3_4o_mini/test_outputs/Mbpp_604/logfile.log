    Title: Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$
    Part: 1/2
    # Manacher's Algorithm - Finding all sub-palindromes in $O(N)$

    ## Statement

    Given string $s$ with length $n$. Find all the pairs $(i, j)$ such that substring $s[i\dots j]$ is a palindrome. String $t$ is a palindrome when $t = t_{rev}$ ($t_{rev}$ is a reversed string for $t$).

    ## More precise statement

    In the worst case string might have up to $O(n^2)$ palindromic substrings, and at the first glance it seems that there is no linear algorithm for this problem.

    But the information about the palindromes can be kept **in a compact way**: for each position $i$ we will find the number of non-empty palindromes centered at this position.

    Palindromes with a common center form a contiguous chain, that is if we have a palindrome of length $l$ centered in $i$, we also have palindromes of lengths $l-2$, $l-4$ and so on also centered in $i$. Therefore, we will collect the information about all palindromic substrings in this way.

    Palindromes of odd and even lengths are accounted for separately as $d_{odd}[i]$ and $d_{even}[i]$. For the palindromes of even length we assume that they're centered in the position $i$ if their two central characters are $s[i]$ and $s[i-1]$.

    For instance, string $s = abababc$ has three palindromes with odd length with centers in the position $s[3] = b$, i. e. $d_{odd}[3] = 3$:

    $$a\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{b}_{s_3}\ a\ b}^{d_{odd}[3]=3} c$$

    And string $s = cbaabd$ has two palindromes with even length with centers in the position $s[3] = a$, i. e. $d_{even}[3] = 2$:

    $$c\ \overbrace{b\ a\ \underbrace{a}_{s_3}\ b}^{d_{even}[3]=2} d$$

    It's a surprising fact that there is an algorithm, which is simple enough, that calculates these "palindromity arrays" $d_{odd}[]$ and $d_{even}[]$ in linear time. The algorithm is described in this article.

    ## Solution

    In general, this problem has many solutions: with [String Hashing](/string/string-hashing.html) it can be solved in $O(n\cdot \log n)$, and with [Suffix Trees](/string/suffix-tree-ukkonen.html) and fast LCA this problem can be solved in $O(n)$.

    But the method described here is **sufficiently** simpler and has less hidden constant in time and memory complexity. This algorithm was discovered by **Glenn K. Manacher** in 1975.

    Another modern way to solve this problem and to deal with palindromes in general is through the so-called palindromic tree, or eertree.

    ## Trivial algorithm

    To avoid ambiguities in the further description we denote what "trivial algorithm" is.

    It's the algorithm that does the following. For each center position $i$ it tries to increase the answer by one as long as it's possible, comparing a pair of corresponding characters each time.

    Such an algorithm is slow, it can calculate the answer only in $O(n^2)$.

    The implementation of the trivial algorithm is:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> manacher_odd(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        s = "$" + s + "^";
        vector<int> p(n + 2);
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            while(s[i - p[i]] == s[i + p[i]]) {
                p[i]++;
            }
        }
        return vector<int>(begin(p) + 1, end(p) - 1);
    }

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.

        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

    Title: String Hashing
    Part: 1/2
    # String Hashing

    Hashing algorithms are helpful in solving a lot of problems.

    We want to solve the problem of comparing strings efficiently.
    The brute force way of doing so is just to compare the letters of both strings, which has a time complexity of $O(\min(n_1, n_2))$ if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sizes of the two strings.
    We want to do better.
    The idea behind the string hashing is the following: we map each string into an integer and compare those instead of the strings.
    Doing this allows us to reduce the execution time of the string comparison to $O(1)$.

    For the conversion, we need a so-called **hash function**.
    The goal of it is to convert a string into an integer, the so-called **hash** of the string.
    The following condition has to hold: if two strings $s$ and $t$ are equal ($s = t$), then also their hashes have to be equal ($\text{hash}(s) = \text{hash}(t)$).
    Otherwise, we will not be able to compare strings.

    Notice, the opposite direction doesn't have to hold.
    If the hashes are equal ($\text{hash}(s) = \text{hash}(t)$), then the strings do not necessarily have to be equal.
    E.g. a valid hash function would be simply $\text{hash}(s) = 0$ for each $s$.
    Now, this is just a stupid example, because this function will be completely useless, but it is a valid hash function.
    The reason why the opposite direction doesn't have to hold, is because there are exponentially many strings.
    If we only want this hash function to distinguish between all strings consisting of lowercase characters of length smaller than 15, then already the hash wouldn't fit into a 64-bit integer (e.g. unsigned long long) any more, because there are so many of them.
    And of course, we don't want to compare arbitrary long integers, because this will also have the complexity $O(n)$.

    So usually we want the hash function to map strings onto numbers of a fixed range $[0, m)$, then comparing strings is just a comparison of two integers with a fixed length.
    And of course, we want $\text{hash}(s) \neq \text{hash}(t)$ to be very likely if $s \neq t$.

    That's the important part that you have to keep in mind.
    Using hashing will not be 100% deterministically correct, because two complete different strings might have the same hash (the hashes collide).
    However, in a wide majority of tasks, this can be safely ignored as the probability of the hashes of two different strings colliding is still very small.
    And we will discuss some techniques in this article how to keep the probability of collisions very low.

    ## Calculation of the hash of a string

    The good and widely used way to define the hash of a string $s$ of length $n$ is

    $$\begin{align}
    \text{hash}(s) &= s[0] + s[1] \cdot p + s[2] \cdot p^2 + ... + s[n-1] \cdot p^{n-1} \mod m \\
    &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \cdot p^i \mod m,
    \end{align}$$

    where $p$ and $m$ are some chosen, positive numbers.
    It is called a **polynomial rolling hash function**.

    It is reasonable to make $p$ a prime number roughly equal to the number of characters in the input alphabet.
    For example, if the input is composed of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, $p = 31$ is a good choice.
    If the input may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, then $p = 53$ is a possible choice.
    The code in this article will use $p = 31$.

    Obviously $m$ should be a large number since the probability of two random strings colliding is about $\approx \frac{1}{m}$.
    Sometimes $m = 2^{64}$ is chosen, since then the integer overflows of 64-bit integers work exactly like the modulo operation.
    However, there exists a method, which generates colliding strings (which work independently from the choice of $p$).
    So in practice, $m = 2^{64}$ is not recommended.
    A good choice for $m$ is some large prime number.
    The code in this article will just use $m = 10^9+9$.
    This is a large number, but still small enough so that we can perform multiplication of two values using 64-bit integers.

    Here is an example of calculating the hash of a string $s$, which contains only lowercase letters.
    We convert each character of $s$ to an integer.
    Here we use the conversion $a \rightarrow 1$, $b \rightarrow 2$, $\dots$, $z \rightarrow 26$.
    Converting $a \rightarrow 0$ is not a good idea, because then the hashes of the strings $a$, $aa$, $aaa$, $\dots$ all evaluate to $0$.

    ```{.cpp file=hashing_function}
    long long compute_hash(string const& s) {
        const int p = 31;
        const int m = 1e9 + 9;
        long long hash_value = 0;
        long long p_pow = 1;
        for (char c : s) {
            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;
            p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;
        }
        return hash_value;
    }
    ```

    Precomputing the powers of $p$ might give a performance boost.

    ## Example tasks

    ### Search for duplicate strings in an array of strings

    Problem: Given a list of $n$ strings $s_i$, each no longer than $m$ characters, find all the duplicate strings and divide them into groups.

    From the obvious algorithm involving sorting the strings, we would get a time complexity of $O(n m \log n)$ where the sorting requires $O(n \log n)$ comparisons and each comparison take $O(m)$ time.
    However, by using hashes, we reduce the comparison time to $O(1)$, giving us an algorithm that runs in $O(n m + n \log n)$ time.

    We calculate the hash for each string, sort the hashes together with the indices, and then group the indices by identical hashes.

    ```{.cpp file=hashing_group_identical_strings}
    vector<vector<int>> group_identical_strings(vector<string> const& s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<pair<long long, int>> hashes(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            hashes[i] = {compute_hash(s[i]), i};

        sort(hashes.begin(), hashes.end());

        vector<vector<int>> groups;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i == 0 || hashes[i].first != hashes[i-1].first)
                groups.emplace_back();
            groups.back().push_back(hashes[i].second);
        }
        return groups;
    }
