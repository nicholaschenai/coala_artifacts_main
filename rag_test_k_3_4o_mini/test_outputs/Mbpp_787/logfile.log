    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    Title: Finding repetitions
    Part: 1/2
    # Finding repetitions

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.

    A **repetition** is two occurrences of a string in a row.
    In other words a repetition can be described by a pair of indices $i < j$ such that the substring $s[i \dots j]$ consists of two identical strings written after each other.

    The challenge is to **find all repetitions** in a given string $s$.
    Or a simplified task: find **any** repetition or find the **longest** repetition.

    The algorithm described here was published in 1982 by Main and Lorentz.

    ## Example

    Consider the repetitions in the following example string:

    $$acababaee$$

    The string contains the following three repetitions:

    - $s[2 \dots 5] = abab$
    - $s[3 \dots 6] = baba$
    - $s[7 \dots 7] = ee$

    Another example:

    $$abaaba$$

    Here there are only two repetitions

    - $s[0 \dots 5] = abaaba$
    - $s[2 \dots 3] = aa$

    ## Number of repetitions

    In general there can be up to $O(n^2)$ repetitions in a string of length $n$.
    An obvious example is a string consisting of $n$ times the same letter, in this case any substring of even length is a repetition.
    In general any periodic string with a short period will contain a lot of repetitions.

    On the other hand this fact does not prevent computing the number of repetitions in $O(n \log n)$ time, because the algorithm can give the repetitions in compressed form, in groups of several pieces at once.

    There is even the concept, that describes groups of periodic substrings with tuples of size four.
    It has been proven that we the number of such groups is at most linear with respect to the string length.

    Also, here are some more interesting results related to the number of repetitions:

      - The number of primitive repetitions (those whose halves are not repetitions) is at most $O(n \log n)$.
      - If we encode repetitions with tuples of numbers (called Crochemore triples) $(i,~ p,~ r)$ (where $i$ is the position of the beginning, $p$ the length of the repeating substring, and $r$ the number of repetitions), then all repetitions can be described with $O(n \log n)$ such triples.
      - Fibonacci strings, defined as 
    
        \[\begin{align}
        t_0 &= a, \\\\
        t_1 &= b, \\\\
        t_i &= t_{i-1} + t_{i-2},
        \end{align}\]
    
        are "strongly" periodic.
        The number of repetitions in the Fibonacci string $f_i$, even in the compressed with Crochemore triples, is $O(f_n \log f_n)$.
        The number of primitive repetitions is also $O(f_n \log f_n)$.

    ## Main-Lorentz algorithm

    The idea behind the Main-Lorentz algorithm is **divide-and-conquer**.

    It splits the initial string into halves, and computes the number of repetitions that lie completely in each halve by two recursive calls.
    Then comes the difficult part.
    The algorithm finds all repetitions starting in the first half and ending in the second half (which we will call **crossing repetitions**).
    This is the essential part of the Main-Lorentz algorithm, and we will discuss it in detail here.

    The complexity of divide-and-conquer algorithms is well researched.
    The [master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)) says, that we will end up with an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm, if we can compute the crossing repetitions in $O(n)$ time.

    ### Search for crossing repetitions

    So we want to find all such repetitions that start in the first half of the string, let's call it $u$, and end in the second half, let's call it $v$:

    $$s = u + v$$

    Their lengths are approximately equal to the length of $s$ divided by two.

    Consider an arbitrary repetition and look at the middle character (more precisely the first character of the second half of the repetition).
    I.e. if the repetition is a substring $s[i \dots j]$, then the middle character is $(i + j + 1) / 2$.

    We call a repetition **left** or **right** depending on which string this character is located - in the string $u$ or in the string $v$.
    In other words a string is called left, if the majority of it lies in $u$, otherwise we call it right.

    We will now discuss how to find **all left repetitions**.
    Finding all right repetitions can be done in the same way.

    Let us denote the length of the left repetition by $2l$ (i.e. each half of the repetition has length $l$).
    Consider the first character of the repetition falling into the string $v$ (it is at position $|u|$ in the string $s$).
    It coincides with the character $l$ positions before it, let's denote this position $cntr$.

    We will fixate this position $cntr$, and **look for all repetitions at this position** $cntr$.

    For example:

    $$c ~ \underset{cntr}{a} ~ c ~ | ~ a ~ d ~ a$$

    The vertical lines divides the two halves.
    Here we fixated the position $cntr = 1$, and at this position we find the repetition $caca$.

    It is clear, that if we fixate the position $cntr$, we simultaneously fixate the length of the possible repetitions: $l = |u| - cntr$.
    Once we know how to find these repetitions, we will iterate over all possible values for $cntr$ from $0$ to $|u|-1$, and find all left crossover repetitions of length $l = |u|,~ |u|-1,~ \dots, 1$.

    ### Criterion for left crossing repetitions

    Now, how can we find all such repetitions for a fixated $cntr$?
    Keep in mind that there still can be multiple such repetitions.

    Let's again look at a visualization, this time for the repetition $abcabc$:

    $$\overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ \overbrace{\underset{cntr}{b} ~ c}^{l_2} ~ \overbrace{a}^{l_1} ~ | ~ \overbrace{b ~ c}^{l_2}$$

    Here we denoted the lengths of the two pieces of the repetition with $l_1$ and $l_2$:
    $l_1$ is the length of the repetition up to the position $cntr-1$, and $l_2$ is the length of the repetition from $cntr$ to the end of the half of the repetition.
    We have $2l = l_1 + l_2 + l_1 + l_2$ as the total length of the repetition.

    Let us generate **necessary and sufficient** conditions for such a repetition at position $cntr$ of length $2l = 2(l_1 + l_2) = 2(|u| - cntr)$:

    - Let $k_1$ be the largest number such that the first $k_1$ characters before the position $cntr$ coincide with the last $k_1$ characters in the string $u$:
  
    $$
    u[cntr - k_1 \dots cntr - 1] = u[|u| - k_1 \dots |u| - 1]
    $$
  
    - Let $k_2$ be the largest number such that the $k_2$ characters starting at position $cntr$ coincide with the first $k_2$ characters in the string $v$:

    $$  
      u[cntr \dots cntr + k_2 - 1] = v[0 \dots k_2 - 1]
    $$
  
    - Then we have a repetition exactly for any pair $(l_1,~ l_2)$ with

    $$
      \begin{align}
      l_1 &\le k_1, \\\\
      l_2 &\le k_2. \\\\
      \end{align}
    $$

    To summarize:

    - We fixate a specific position $cntr$.
    - All repetition which we will find now have length $2l = 2(|u| - cntr)$.
      There might be multiple such repetitions, they depend on the lengths $l_1$ and $l_2 = l - l_1$.
    - We find $k_1$ and $k_2$ as described above.
    - Then all suitable repetitions are the ones for which the lengths of the pieces $l_1$ and $l_2$ satisfy the conditions:

    $$
      \begin{align}
      l_1 + l_2 &= l = |u| - cntr \\\\
      l_1 &\le k_1, \\\\
      l_2 &\le k_2. \\\\
      \end{align}
    $$

    Therefore the only remaining part is how we can compute the values $k_1$ and $k_2$ quickly for every position $cntr$.
    Luckily we can compute them in $O(1)$ using the [Z-function](../string/z-function.md):

    - To can find the value $k_1$ for each position by calculating the Z-function for the string $\overline{u}$ (i.e. the reversed string $u$).
      Then the value $k_1$ for a particular $cntr$ will be equal to the corresponding value of the array of the Z-function.
    - To precompute all values $k_2$, we calculate the Z-function for the string $v + \# + u$ (i.e. the string $u$ concatenated with the separator character $\#$ and the string $v$).
      Again we just need to look up the corresponding value in the Z-function to get the $k_2$ value.

    So this is enough to find all left crossing repetitions.

    ### Right crossing repetitions

    For computing the right crossing repetitions we act similarly:
    we define the center $cntr$ as the character corresponding to the last character in the string $u$.

    Title: Balanced bracket sequences
    Part: 1/2
    # Balanced bracket sequences

    A **balanced bracket sequence** is a string consisting of only brackets, such that this sequence, when inserted certain numbers and mathematical operations, gives a valid mathematical expression.
    Formally you can define balanced bracket sequence with:

    - $e$ (the empty string) is a balanced bracket sequence.
    - if $s$ is a balanced bracket sequence, then so is $(s)$.
    - if $s$ and $t$ are balanced bracket sequences, then so is $s t$.

    For instance $(())()$ is a balanced bracket sequence, but $())($ is not.

    Of course you can define other bracket sequences also with multiple bracket types in a similar fashion.

    In this article we discuss some classic problems involving balanced bracket sequences (for simplicity we will only call them sequences): validation, number of sequences, finding the lexicographical next sequence, generating all sequences of a certain size, finding the index of sequence, and generating the $k$-th sequences.
    We will also discuss two variations for the problems, the simpler version when only one type of brackets is allowed, and the harder case when there are multiple types.

    ## Balance validation

    We want to check if a given string is balanced or not.

    At first suppose there is only one type of bracket.
    For this case there exists a very simple algorithm.
    Let $\text{depth}$ be the current number of open brackets.
    Initially $\text{depth} = 0$.
    We iterate over all character of the string, if the current bracket character is an opening bracket, then we increment $\text{depth}$, otherwise we decrement it.
    If at any time the variable $\text{depth}$ gets negative, or at the end it is different from $0$, then the string is not a balanced sequence.
    Otherwise it is.

    If there are several bracket types involved, then the algorithm needs to be changes.
    Instead of a counter $\text{depth}$ we create a stack, in which we will store all opening brackets that we meet.
    If the current bracket character is an opening one, we put it onto the stack.
    If it is a closing one, then we check if the stack is non-empty, and if the top element of the stack is of the same type as the current closing bracket.
    If both conditions are fulfilled, then we remove the opening bracket from the stack.
    If at any time one of the conditions is not fulfilled, or at the end the stack is not empty, then the string is not balanced.
    Otherwise it is.

    ## Number of balanced sequences

    ### Formula

    The number of balanced bracket sequences with only one bracket type can be calculated using the [Catalan numbers](catalan-numbers.md).
    The number of balanced bracket sequences of length $2n$ ($n$ pairs of brackets) is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$$

    If we allow $k$ types of brackets, then each pair be of any of the $k$ types (independently of the others), thus the number of balanced bracket sequences is:

    $$\frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} k^n$$

    ### Dynamic programming

    On the other hand these numbers can be computed using **dynamic programming**.
    Let $d[n]$ be the number of regular bracket sequences with $n$ pairs of bracket.
    Note that in the first position there is always an opening bracket.
    And somewhere later is the corresponding closing bracket of the pair.
    It is clear that inside this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence, and similarly after this pair there is a balanced bracket sequence.
    So to compute $d[n]$, we will look at how many balanced sequences of $i$ pairs of brackets are inside this first bracket pair, and how many balanced sequences with $n-1-i$ pairs are after this pair.
    Consequently the formula has the form:

    $$d[n] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d[i] \cdot d[n-1-i]$$

    The initial value for this recurrence is $d[0] = 1$.

    ## Finding the lexicographical next balanced sequence

    Here we only consider the case with one valid bracket type.

    Given a balanced sequence, we have to find the next (in lexicographical order) balanced sequence.

    It should be obvious, that we have to find the rightmost opening bracket, which we can replace by a closing bracket without violation the condition, that there are more closing brackets than opening brackets up to this position.
    After replacing this position, we can fill the remaining part of the string with the lexicographically minimal one: i.e. first with as much opening brackets as possible, and then fill up the remaining positions with closing brackets.
    In other words we try to leave a long as possible prefix unchanged, and the suffix gets replaced by the lexicographically minimal one.

    To find this position, we can iterate over the character from right to left, and maintain the balance $\text{depth}$ of open and closing brackets.
    When we meet an opening brackets, we will decrement $\text{depth}$, and when we meet a closing bracket, we increase it.
    If we are at some point meet an opening bracket, and the balance after processing this symbol is positive, then we have found the rightmost position that we can change.
    We change the symbol, compute the number of opening and closing brackets that we have to add to the right side, and arrange them in the lexicographically minimal way.

    If we find do suitable position, then this sequence is already the maximal possible one, and there is no answer.

    ```{.cpp file=next_balanced_brackets_sequence}
    bool next_balanced_sequence(string & s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int depth = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s[i] == '(')
                depth--;
            else
                depth++;

            if (s[i] == '(' && depth > 0) {
                depth--;
                int open = (n - i - 1 - depth) / 2;
                int close = n - i - 1 - open;
                string next = s.substr(0, i) + ')' + string(open, '(') + string(close, ')');
                s.swap(next);
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/787 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string contains the specific pattern of an 'a' followed by exactly three 'b's (i.e., "abbb"). If the string does not match this pattern, the function should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: 
   The function will take a string as input and check if it contains the substring "abbb". If it does, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`. We can achieve this by using string slicing and checking the length of the string to ensure it matches the required pattern.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function text_match_three(s: str) -> bool:
       if length of s is less than 4:
           return False
       if s[0] is 'a' and s[1:4] is 'bbb':
           return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def text_match_three(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the string is at least 4 characters long
    if len(s) < 4:
        return False
    # Check if the string starts with 'a' and is followed by exactly three 'b's
    if s[0] == 'a' and s[1:4] == 'bbb':
        return True
    return False
