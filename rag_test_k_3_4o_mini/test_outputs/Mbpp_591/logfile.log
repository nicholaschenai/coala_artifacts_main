INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/591 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of elements and swaps the first and last elements of that list. 

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we will check if the list has at least two elements (since we cannot swap if there is only one or no elements). If it does, we will store the first element, replace the first element with the last element, and then replace the last element with the stored first element. Finally, we will return the modified list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function swap_List(input_list):
       if length of input_list is less than 2:
           return input_list
       store first_element as input_list[0]
       set input_list[0] to input_list[-1]  // last element
       set input_list[-1] to first_element
       return input_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def swap_List(input_list):
    # Check if the list has less than 2 elements
    if len(input_list) < 2:
        return input_list  # No swap needed, return the original list
    
    # Store the first element
    first_element = input_list[0]
    # Swap the first element with the last element
    input_list[0] = input_list[-1]  # Set first element to last element
    input_list[-1] = first_element  # Set last element to the stored first element
    
    return input_list  # Return the modified list

    \index{sorting}

    \key{Sorting}
    is a fundamental algorithm design problem.
    Many efficient algorithms
    use sorting as a subroutine,
    because it is often easier to process
    data if the elements are in a sorted order.

    For example, the problem ''does an array contain
    two equal elements?'' is easy to solve using sorting.
    If the array contains two equal elements,
    they will be next to each other after sorting,
    so it is easy to find them.
    Also, the problem ''what is the most frequent element
    in an array?'' can be solved similarly.

    There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are
    also good examples of how to apply
    different algorithm design techniques.
    The efficient general sorting algorithms
    work in $O(n \log n)$ time,
    and many algorithms that use sorting
    as a subroutine also
    have this time complexity.

    \section{Sorting theory}

    The basic problem in sorting is as follows:
    \begin{framed}
    \noindent
    Given an array that contains $n$ elements,
    your task is to sort the elements
    in increasing order.
    \end{framed}
    \noindent
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    will be as follows after sorting:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{$O(n^2)$ algorithms}

    \index{bubble sort}

    Simple algorithms for sorting an array
    work in $O(n^2)$ time.
    Such algorithms are short and usually
    consist of two nested loops.
    A famous $O(n^2)$ time sorting algorithm
    is \key{bubble sort} where the elements
    ''bubble'' in the array according to their values.

    Bubble sort consists of $n$ rounds.
    On each round, the algorithm iterates through
    the elements of the array.
    Whenever two consecutive elements are found
    that are not in correct order,
    the algorithm swaps them.
    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n-1; j++) {
            if (array[j] > array[j+1]) {
                swap(array[j],array[j+1]);
            }
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    After the first round of the algorithm,
    the largest element will be in the correct position,
    and in general, after $k$ rounds, the $k$ largest
    elements will be in the correct positions.
    Thus, after $n$ rounds, the whole array
    will be sorted.

    For example, in the array

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$8$};

    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \noindent
    the first round of bubble sort swaps elements
    as follows:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Inversions}

    \index{inversion}

    Bubble sort is an example of a sorting
    algorithm that always swaps \emph{consecutive}
    elements in the array.
    It turns out that the time complexity
    of such an algorithm is \emph{always}
    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,
    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.

    A useful concept when analyzing sorting
    algorithms is an \key{inversion}:
    a pair of array elements
    $(\texttt{array}[a],\texttt{array}[b])$ such that
    $a<b$ and $\texttt{array}[a]>\texttt{array}[b]$,
    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.
    For example, the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$9$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    has three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.
    The number of inversions indicates
    how much work is needed to sort the array.
    An array is completely sorted when
    there are no inversions.
    On the other hand, if the array elements
    are in the reverse order,
    the number of inversions is the largest possible:
    \[1+2+\cdots+(n-1)=\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\]

    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are
    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion
    from the array.
    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only
    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes
    at most one inversion, and the time complexity
    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{$O(n \log n)$ algorithms}

    \index{merge sort}

    It is possible to sort an array efficiently
    in $O(n \log n)$ time using algorithms
    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.
    One such algorithm is \key{merge sort}\footnote{According to \cite{knu983},
    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},
    which is based on recursion.

    Merge sort sorts a subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$ as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.
    \item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\lfloor (a+b)/2 \rfloor$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$.
    \item Recursively sort the subarray \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$.
    \item \emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and
    \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    into a sorted subarray \texttt{array}$[a \ldots b]$.
    \end{enumerate}

    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it
    halves the size of the subarray at each step.
    The recursion consists of $O(\log n)$ levels,
    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.
    Merging the subarrays \texttt{array}$[a \ldots k]$ and \texttt{array}$[k+1 \ldots b]$
    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.

    For example, consider sorting the following array:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);
    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$6$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$8$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$9

    Chapter: Data structures
    Section: Comparison to sorting
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Comparison to sorting}

    It is often possible to solve a problem
    using either data structures or sorting.
    Sometimes there are remarkable differences
    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,
    which may be hidden in their time complexities.

    Let us consider a problem where
    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$
    that both contain $n$ elements.
    Our task is to calculate the number of elements
    that belong to both of the lists.
    For example, for the lists
    \[A = [5,2,8,9] \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\]
    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5
    and 9 belong to both of the lists.

    A straightforward solution to the problem is
    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,
    but next we will focus on
    more efficient algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,
    and after this, we iterate through the elements
    of $B$ and check for each elements if it
    also belongs to $A$.
    This is efficient because the elements of $A$
    are in a set.
    Using the \texttt{set} structure,
    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,
    so instead of the \texttt{set} structure
    we can also use the \texttt{unordered\_set} structure.
    This is an easy way to make the algorithm
    more efficient, because we only have to change
    the underlying data structure.
    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.
    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.
    After this, we iterate through both the lists
    at the same time and find the common elements.
    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n)$,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    so the total time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    The following table shows how efficient
    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and
    the elements of the lists are random
    integers between $1 \ldots 10^9$:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\
    $2 \cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\
    $3 \cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\
    $4 \cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\
    $5 \cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that
    they use different set structures.
    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on
    the running time, because Algorithm 2
    is 4–5 times faster than Algorithm 1.

    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3
    which uses sorting.
    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.
    Interestingly, the time complexity of both
    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \log n)$,
    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.
    This can be explained by the fact that
    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done
    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.
    On the other hand,
    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree
    during the whole algorithm.

    Title: Minimum stack / Minimum queue
    Part: 1/1
    # Minimum stack / Minimum queue

    In this article we will consider three problems: 
    first we will modify a stack in a way that allows us to find the smallest element of the stack in $O(1)$, then we will do the same thing with a queue, and finally we will use these data structures to find the minimum in all subarrays of a fixed length in an array in $O(n)$

    ## Stack modification

    We want to modify the stack data structure in such a way, that it possible to find the smallest element in the stack in $O(1)$ time, while maintaining the same asymptotic behavior for adding and removing elements from the stack.
    Quick reminder, on a stack we only add and remove elements on one end.

    To do this, we will not only store the elements in the stack, but we will store them in pairs: the element itself and the minimum in the stack starting from this element and below.

    ```cpp
    stack<pair<int, int>> st;
    ```

    It is clear that finding the minimum in the whole stack consists only of looking at the value `stack.top().second`.

    It is also obvious that adding or removing a new element to the stack can be done in constant time.

    Implementation:

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    int new_min = st.empty() ? new_elem : min(new_elem, st.top().second);
    st.push({new_elem, new_min});
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    int removed_element = st.top().first;
    st.pop();
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = st.top().second;
    ```

    ## Queue modification (method 1)

    Now we want to achieve the same operations with a queue, i.e. we want to add elements at the end and remove them from the front.

    Here we consider a simple method for modifying a queue.
    It has a big disadvantage though, because the modified queue will actually not store all elements.

    The key idea is to only store the items in the queue that are needed to determine the minimum.
    Namely we will keep the queue in nondecreasing order (i.e. the smallest value will be stored in the head), and of course not in any arbitrary way, the actual minimum has to be always contained in the queue.
    This way the smallest element will always be in the head of the queue.
    Before adding a new element to the queue, it is enough to make a "cut":
    we will remove all trailing elements of the queue that are larger than the new element, and afterwards add the new element to the queue. 
    This way we don't break the order of the queue, and we will also not loose the current element if it is at any subsequent step the minimum. 
    All the elements that we removed can never be a minimum itself, so this operation is allowed.
    When we want to extract an element from the head, it actually might not be there (because we removed it previously while adding a smaller element). 
    Therefore when deleting an element from a queue we need to know the value of the element.
    If the head of the queue has the same value, we can safely remove it, otherwise we do nothing.

    Consider the implementations of the above operations:

    ```cpp
    deque<int> q;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = q.front();
    ```

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    while (!q.empty() && q.back() > new_element)
        q.pop_back();
    q.push_back(new_element);
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (!q.empty() && q.front() == remove_element)
        q.pop_front();
    ```

    It is clear that on average all these operation only take $O(1)$ time (because every element can only be pushed and popped once).

    ## Queue modification (method 2)

    This is a modification of method 1.
    We want to be able to remove elements without knowing which element we have to remove.
    We can accomplish that by storing the index for each element in the queue.
    And we also remember how many elements we already have added and removed.

    ```cpp
    deque<pair<int, int>> q;
    int cnt_added = 0;
    int cnt_removed = 0;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = q.front().first;
    ```

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    while (!q.empty() && q.back().first > new_element)
        q.pop_back();
    q.push_back({new_element, cnt_added});
    cnt_added++;
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (!q.empty() && q.front().second == cnt_removed) 
        q.pop_front();
    cnt_removed++;
    ```

    ## Queue modification (method 3)

    Here we consider another way of modifying a queue to find the minimum in $O(1)$.
    This way is somewhat more complicated to implement, but this time we actually store all elements.
    And we also can remove an element from the front without knowing its value.

    The idea is to reduce the problem to the problem of stacks, which was already solved by us.
    So we only need to learn how to simulate a queue using two stacks.

    We make two stacks, `s1` and `s2`. 
    Of course these stack will be of the modified form, so that we can find the minimum in $O(1)$. 
    We will add new elements to the stack `s1`, and remove elements from the stack `s2`.
    If at any time the stack `s2` is empty, we move all elements from `s1` to `s2` (which essentially reverses the order of those elements).
    Finally finding the minimum in a queue involves just finding the minimum of both stacks.

    Thus we perform all operations in $O(1)$ on average (each element will be once added to stack `s1`, once transferred to `s2`, and once popped from `s2`)

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    stack<pair<int, int>> s1, s2;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    if (s1.empty() || s2.empty()) 
        minimum = s1.empty() ? s2.top().second : s1.top().second;
    else
        minimum = min(s1.top().second, s2.top().second);
    ```

    * Add element:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = s1.empty() ? new_element : min(new_element, s1.top().second);
    s1.push({new_element, minimum});
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (s2.empty()) {
        while (!s1.empty()) {
            int element = s1.top().first;
            s1.pop();
            int minimum = s2.empty() ? element : min(element, s2.top().second);
            s2.push({element, minimum});
        }
    }
    int remove_element = s2.top().first;
    s2.pop();
    ```

    ## Finding the minimum for all subarrays of fixed length

    Suppose we are given an array $A$ of length $N$ and a given $M \le N$.
    We have to find the minimum of each subarray of length $M$ in this array, i.e. we have to find:

    $$\min_{0 \le i \le M-1} A[i], \min_{1 \le i \le M} A[i], \min_{2 \le i \le M+1} A[i],~\dots~, \min_{N-M \le i \le N-1} A[i]$$

    We have to solve this problem in linear time, i.e. $O(n)$.

    We can use any of the three modified queues to solve the problem.
    The solutions should be clear:
    we add the first $M$ element of the array, find and output its minimum, then add the next element to the queue and remove the first element of the array, find and output its minimum, etc. 
    Since all operations with the queue are performed in constant time on average, the complexity of the whole algorithm will be $O(n)$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/591 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of elements and swaps the first and last elements of that list. For example, if the input list is `[12, 35, 9, 56, 24]`, the output should be `[24, 35, 9, 56, 12]`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we need to check if the list has at least two elements (since we cannot swap if there is only one or no elements). If it does, we will store the first element in a temporary variable, replace the first element with the last element, and then set the last element to the value stored in the temporary variable. Finally, we will return the modified list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function swap_List(input_list):
       if length of input_list < 2:
           return input_list
       temp = input_list[0]  // store the first element
       input_list[0] = input_list[-1]  // set first element to last element
       input_list[-1] = temp  // set last element to the stored first element
       return input_list
   ```
