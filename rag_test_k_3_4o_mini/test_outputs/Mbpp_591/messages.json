\\emph{consecutive}\n    elements in the array.\n    It turns out that the time complexity\n    of such an algorithm is \\emph{always}\n    at least $O(n^2)$, because in the worst case,\n    $O(n^2)$ swaps are required for sorting the array.\n\n    A useful concept when analyzing sorting\n    algorithms is an \\key{inversion}:\n    a pair of array elements\n    $(\\texttt{array}[a],\\texttt{array}[b])$ such that\n    $a<b$ and $\\texttt{array}[a]>\\texttt{array}[b]$,\n    i.e., the elements are in the wrong order.\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at

three inversions: $(6,3)$, $(6,5)$ and $(9,8)$.\n    The number of inversions indicates\n    how much work is needed to sort the array.\n    An array is completely sorted when\n    there are no inversions.\n    On the other hand, if the array elements\n    are in the reverse order,\n    the number of inversions is the largest possible:\n    \\[1+2+\\cdots+(n-1)=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = O(n^2)\\]\n\n    Swapping a pair of consecutive elements that are\n    in the wrong order removes exactly one inversion\n    from the array.\n    Hence, if a sorting algorithm can only\n    swap consecutive elements, each swap removes\n    at most one inversion, and the time complexity\n    of the algorithm is at least $O(n^2)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{$O(n \\log n)$ algorithms}\n\n    \\index{merge sort}\n\n    It is possible to sort an array efficiently\n    in $O(n \\log n)$ time using algorithms\n    that are not limited to swapping consecutive elements.\n    One such algorithm is \\key{merge sort}\\footnote{According to \\cite{knu983},\n    merge sort was invented by J. von Neumann in 1945.},\n    which is based on recursion.\n\n    Merge sort sorts a subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$ as follows:\n\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item If $a=b$, do not do anything, because the subarray is already sorted.\n    \\item Calculate the position of the middle element: $k=\\lfloor (a+b)/2 \\rfloor$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$.\n    \\item Recursively sort the subarray \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$.\n    \\item \\emph{Merge} the sorted subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and\n    \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    into a sorted subarray \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots b]$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    Merge sort is an efficient algorithm, because it\n    halves the size of the subarray at each step.\n    The recursion consists of $O(\\log n)$ levels,\n    and processing each level takes $O(n)$ time.\n    Merging the subarrays \\texttt{array}$[a \\ldots k]$ and \\texttt{array}$[k+1 \\ldots b]$\n    is possible in linear time, because they are already sorted.\n\n    For example, consider sorting the following array:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at

Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Data structures\n    Section: Comparison to sorting\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Comparison to sorting}\n\n    It is often possible to solve a problem\n    using either data structures or sorting.\n    Sometimes there are remarkable differences\n    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,\n    which may be hidden in their time complexities.\n\n    Let us consider a problem where\n    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$\n    that both contain $n$ elements.\n    Our task is to calculate the number of elements\n    that belong to both of the lists.\n    For example, for the lists\n    \\[A = [5,2,8,9] \\hspace{10px} \\textrm{and} \\hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\\]\n    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5\n    and 9 belong to both of the lists.\n\n    A straightforward solution to the problem is\n    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,\n    but next we will focus on\n    more efficient algorithms.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,\n    and after this, we iterate through the elements\n    of $B$ and check for each elements if it\n    also belongs to $A$.\n    This is efficient because the elements of $A$\n    are in a set.\n    Using the \\texttt{set} structure,\n    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,\n    so instead of the \\texttt{set} structure\n    we can also use the \\texttt{unordered\\_set} structure.\n    This is an easy way to make the algorithm\n    more efficient, because we only have to change\n    the underlying data structure.\n    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 3}\n\n    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.\n    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.\n    After this, we iterate through both the lists\n    at the same time and find the common elements.\n    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,\n    so the total time complexity is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    The following table shows how efficient\n    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and\n    the elements of the lists are random\n    integers between $1 \\ldots 10^9$:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s

$10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that\n    they use different set structures.\n    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on\n    the running time, because Algorithm 2\n    is 4\u20135 times faster than Algorithm 1.\n\n    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3\n    which uses sorting.\n    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.\n    Interestingly, the time complexity of both\n    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.\n    This can be explained by the fact that\n    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done\n    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.\n    On the other hand,\n    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree\n    during the whole algorithm.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Minimum stack / Minimum queue\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Minimum stack / Minimum queue\n\n    In this article we will consider three problems: \n    first we will modify a stack in a way that allows us to find the smallest element of the stack in $O(1)$, then we will do the same thing with a queue, and finally we will use these data structures to find the minimum in all subarrays of a fixed length in an array in $O(n)$\n\n    ## Stack modification\n\n    We want to modify the stack data structure in such a way, that it possible to find the smallest element in the stack in $O(1)$ time, while maintaining the same asymptotic behavior for adding and removing elements from the stack.\n    Quick reminder, on a stack we only add and remove elements on one end.\n\n    To do this, we will not only store the elements in the stack, but we will store them in pairs: the element itself and the minimum in the stack starting from this element and below.\n\n    ```cpp\n    stack<pair<int, int>> st;\n    ```\n\n    It is clear that finding the minimum in the whole stack consists only of looking at the value `stack.top().second`.\n\n    It is also obvious that adding or removing a new element to the stack can be done in constant time.\n\n    Implementation:\n\n    * Adding an element:\n    ```cpp\n    int new_min = st.empty() ? new_elem : min(new_elem, st.top().second);\n    st.push({new_elem, new_min});\n    ```\n\n    * Removing an element:\n    ```cpp\n    int removed_element = st.top().first;\n    st.pop();\n    ```\n\n    * Finding the minimum:\n    ```cpp\n    int minimum = st.top().second;\n    ```\n\n    ## Queue modification (method 1)\n\n    Now we want to achieve the same operations with a queue, i.e. we want to add elements at the end and remove them from the front.\n\n    Here we consider a simple method for modifying a queue.\n    It has a big disadvantage though, because the modified queue will actually not store all elements.\n\n    The key idea is to only store the items in the queue that are needed to determine the minimum.\n    Namely we will keep the queue in nondecreasing order (i.e. the smallest value will be stored in the head), and of course not in any arbitrary way, the actual minimum has to be always contained in the queue.\n    This way the smallest element will always be in the head of the queue.\n    Before adding a new element to the queue, it is enough to make a \"cut\":\n    we will remove all trailing elements of the queue that are larger than the new element, and afterwards add the new element to the queue. \n    This way we don't break the order of the queue, and we will also not loose the current element if it is at any subsequent step the minimum. \n    All the elements that we removed can never be a minimum itself, so this operation is allowed.\n    When we want to extract an element from the head, it actually might not be there (because we removed it previously while adding a smaller element). \n    Therefore when deleting an element from a queue we need to know the value of the element.\n    If the head of the queue has the same value, we can safely remove it, otherwise we do nothing.\n\n    Consider the implementations of the above operations:\n\n    ```cpp\n    deque<int> q;\n    ```\n\n    * Finding the minimum:\n    ```cpp\n    int minimum = q.front();\n    ```\n\n    * Adding an element:\n    ```cpp\n    while (!q.empty() && q.back() > new_element)\n        q.pop_back();\n    q.push_back(new_element);\n    ```\n\n    * Removing an element:\n    ```cpp\n    if (!q.empty() && q.front() == remove_element)\n        q.pop_front();\n    ```\n\n    It is clear that on average all these operation only take $O(1)$ time (because every element can only be pushed and popped once).\n\n    ## Queue modification (method 2)\n\n    This is a modification of method 1.\n    We want to be able to remove elements without knowing which element we have to remove.\n    We can accomplish that by storing the index for each element in the queue.\n    And we also remember how many elements we already have added and removed.\n\n    ```cpp\n    deque<pair<int, int>> q;\n    int cnt_added = 0;\n    int cnt_removed = 0;\n    ```\n\n    * Finding the minimum:\n    ```cpp\n    int minimum = q.front().first;\n    ```\n\n    * Adding an element:\n    ```cpp\n    while (!q.empty() && q.back().first > new_element)\n        q.pop_back();\n    q.push_back({new_element, cnt_added});\n    cnt_added++;\n    ```\n\n    * Removing an element:\n    ```cpp\n    if (!q.empty() && q.front().second == cnt_removed) \n        q.pop_front();\n    cnt_removed++;\n    ```\n\n    ## Queue modification (method 3)\n\n    Here we consider another way of modifying a queue to find the minimum in $O(1)$.\n    This way is somewhat more complicated to implement, but this time we actually store all elements.\n    And we also can remove an element from the front without knowing its value.\n\n    The idea is to reduce the problem to the problem of stacks, which was already solved by us.\n    So we only need to learn how to simulate a queue using two stacks.\n\n    We make two stacks, `s1` and `s2`. \n    Of course these stack will be of the modified form, so that we can find the minimum in $O(1)$. \n    We will add new elements to the stack `s1`, and remove elements from the stack `s2`.\n    If at any time the stack `s2` is empty, we move all elements from `s1` to `s2` (which essentially reverses the order of those elements).\n    Finally finding the minimum in a queue involves just finding the minimum of both stacks.\n\n    Thus we perform all operations in $O(1)$ on average (each element will be once added to stack `s1`, once transferred to `s2`, and once popped from `s2`)\n\n    Implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    stack<pair<int, int>> s1, s2;\n    ```\n\n    * Finding the minimum:\n    ```cpp\n    if (s1.empty() || s2.empty()) \n        minimum = s1.empty() ? s2.top().second : s1.top().second;\n    else\n        minimum = min(s1.top().second, s2.top().second);\n    ```\n\n    * Add element:\n    ```cpp\n    int minimum = s1.empty() ? new_element : min(new_element, s1.top().second);\n    s1.push({new_element, minimum});\n    ```\n\n    * Removing an element:\n    ```cpp\n    if (s2.empty()) {\n        while (!s1.empty()) {\n            int element = s1.top().first;\n            s1.pop();\n            int minimum = s2.empty() ? element : min(element, s2.top().second);\n            s2.push({element, minimum});\n        }\n    }\n    int remove_element = s2.top().first;\n    s2.pop();\n    ```\n\n    ## Finding the minimum for all subarrays of fixed length\n\n    Suppose we are given an array $A$ of length $N$ and a given $M \\le N$.\n    We have to find the minimum of each subarray of length $M$ in this array, i.e. we have to find:\n\n    $$\\min_{0 \\le i \\le M-1} A[i], \\min_{1 \\le i \\le M} A[i], \\min_{2 \\le i \\le M+1} A[i],~\\dots~, \\min_{N-M \\le i \\le N-1} A[i]$$\n\n    We have to solve this problem in linear time, i.e. $O(n)$.\n\n    We can use any of the three modified queues to solve the problem.\n    The solutions should be clear:\n    we add the first $M$ element of the array, find and output its minimum, then add the next element to the queue and remove the first element of the array, find and output its minimum, etc. \n    Since all operations with the queue are performed in constant time on average, the complexity of the whole algorithm will be $O(n)$.\n[/Textbook Reference

For example, if the input list is `[12, 35, 9, 56, 24]`, the output should be `[24, 35, 9, 56, 12]`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we need to check if the list has at least two elements (since we cannot swap if there is only one or no elements). If it does, we will store the first element in a temporary variable, replace the first element with the last element, and then set the last element to the value stored in the temporary variable. Finally, we will return the modified list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function swap_List(input_list):\n       if length of input_list < 2:\n           return input_list\n       temp = input_list[0]  // store the first element\n       input_list[0] = input_list[-1]  // set first element to last element\n       input_list[-1] = temp  // set last element to the stored first element\n       return input_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef swap_List(input_list):\n    # Check if the list has less than 2 elements\n    if len(input_list) < 2:\n        return input_list  # Return the list as is if it has less than 2 elements\n    \n    # Store the first element in a temporary variable\n    temp = input_list[0]\n    \n    # Set the first element to the last element\n    input_list[0] = input_list[-1]\n    \n    # Set the last element to the stored first element\n    input_list[-1] = temp\n    \n    # Return the modified list\n    return input_list\n```"
