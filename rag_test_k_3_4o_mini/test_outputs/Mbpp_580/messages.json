Each point $p_i$ is defined by its coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$. It is required to find among them two such points, such that the distance between them is minimal:\n\n    $$ \\min_{\\scriptstyle i, j=0 \\ldots n-1,\\atop \\scriptstyle i \\neq j } \\rho (p_i, p_j). $$\n\n    We take the usual Euclidean distances:\n\n    $$ \\rho (p_i,p_j) = \\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2} .$$\n\n    The trivial algorithm - iterating over all pairs and calculating the distance for each \u2014 works in $O(n^2)$. \n\n    The algorithm running in time $O(n \\log n)$ is described below. This algorithm was proposed by Shamos and Hoey in 1975. (Source: Ch. 5 Notes of _Algorithm Design_ by Kleinberg & Tardos, also see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4567872)) Preparata and Shamos also showed that this algorithm is optimal in the decision tree model.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n    We construct an algorithm according to the general scheme of **divide-and-conquer** algorithms: the algorithm is designed as a recursive function, to which we pass a set of points; this recursive function splits this set in half, calls itself recursively on each half, and then performs some operations to combine the answers. The operation of combining consist of  detecting the cases when one point of the optimal solution fell into one half, and the other point into the other (in this case, recursive calls from each of the halves cannot detect this pair separately). The main difficulty, as always in case of divide and conquer algorithms, lies in the effective implementation of the merging stage. If a set of $n$ points is passed to the recursive function, then the merge stage should work no more than $O(n)$, then the asymptotics of the whole algorithm $T(n)$ will be found from the equation:\n\n    $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).$$ \n\n    The solution to this equation, as is known, is $T(n) = O(n \\log n).$\n\n    So, we proceed on to the construction of the algorithm. In order to come to an effective implementation of the merge stage in the future, we will divide the set of points into two subsets, according to their $x$-coordinates: In fact, we draw some vertical line dividing the set of points into two subsets of approximately the same size. It is convenient to make such a partition as follows: We sort the points in the standard way as pairs of numbers, ie.:\n\n    $$p_i < p_j \\Longleftrightarrow (x_i < x_j) \\lor \\Big(\\left(x_i = x_j\\right) \\wedge \\left(y_i < y_j \\right) \\Big) $$\n\n    Then take the middle point after sorting $p_m (m = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor)$, and all the points before it and the $p_m$ itself are assigned to the first half, and all the points after it - to the second half:\n\n    $$A_1 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = 0 \\ldots m \\}$$\n\n    $$A_2 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = m + 1 \\ldots n-1 \\}.$$ \n\n    Now, calling recursively on each of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, we will find the answers $h_1$ and $h_2$ for each of the halves. And take the best of them: $h = \\min(h_1, h_2)$.\n\n    Now we need to make a **merge stage**, i.e. we try to find such pairs of points, for which the distance between which is less than $h$ and one point is lying in $A_1$ and the other in $A_2$.\n    It is obvious that it is sufficient to consider only those points that are separated from the vertical line by a distance less than $h$, i.e. the set $B$ of the points considered at this stage is equal to:\n\n    $$B = \\{ p_i\\ | \\ | x_i - x_m\\ | < h \\}.$$ \n\n    For each point in the set $B$, we try to find the points that are closer to it than $h$. For example, it is sufficient to consider only those points whose $y$-coordinate differs by no more than $h$. Moreover, it makes no sense to consider those points whose $y$-coordinate is greater than the $y$-coordinate of the current point. Thus, for each point $p_i$ we define the set of considered points $C(p_i)$ as follows:\n\n    $$C(p_i) = \\{ p_j\\ |\\ p_j \\in B,\\ \\ y_i - h < y_j \\le y_i \\}.$$\n\n    If we sort the points of the set $B$ by $y$-coordinate, it will be very easy to find $C(p_i)$: these are several points in a row ahead to the point $p_i$.\n\n    So, in the new notation, the **merging stage** looks like this: build a set $B$, sort the points in it by $y$-coordinate, then for each point $p_i \\in B$ consider all points $p_j \\in C(p_i)$, and for each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ calculate the distance and compare with the current best distance.\n\n    At first glance, this is still a non-optimal algorithm: it seems that the sizes of sets $C(p_i)$ will be of order $n$, and the required asymptotics will not work. However, surprisingly, it can be proved that the size of each of the sets $C(p_i)$ is a quantity $O(1)$, i.e. it does not exceed some small constant regardless of the points themselves. Proof of this fact is given in the next section.\n\n    Finally, we pay attention to the sorting, which the above algorithm contains: first,sorting by pairs $(x, y)$, and then second, sorting the elements of the set $B$ by $y$. In fact, both of these sorts inside the recursive function can be eliminated (otherwise we would not reach the $O(n)$ estimate for the **merging stage**, and the general asymptotics of the algorithm would be $O(n \\log^2 n)$). It is easy to get rid of the first sort \u2014 it is enough to perform this sort before starting the recursion: after all, the elements themselves do not change inside the recursion, so there is no need to sort again. With the second sorting a little more difficult to perform, performing it previously will not work. But, remembering the merge sort, which also works on the principle of divide-and-conquer, we can simply embed this sort in our recursion. Let recursion, taking some set of points (as we remember,ordered by pairs $(x, y)$), return the same set, but sorted by the $y$-coordinate. To do this, simply merge (in $O(n)$) the two results returned by recursive calls. This will result in a set sorted by $y$-coordinate.\n\n    ## Evaluation of the asymptotics\n\n    To show that the above algorithm is actually executed in $O(n \\log n)$, we need to prove the following fact: $|C(p_i)| = O(1)$.\n\n    So, let us consider some point $p_i$; recall that the set $C(p_i)$ is a set of points whose $y$-coordinate lies in the segment $[y_i-h; y_i]$, and, moreover, along the $x$ coordinate, the point $p_i$ itself, and all the points of the set $C(p_i)$ lie in the band width $2h$. In other words, the points we are considering $p_i$ and $C(p_i)$ lie in a rectangle of size $2h \\times h$.\n\n    Our task is to estimate the maximum number of points that can lie in this rectangle $2h \\times h$; thus, we estimate the maximum size of the set $C(p_i)$. At the same time, when evaluating, we must not forget that there may be repeated points.\n\n    Remember that $h$ was obtained from the results of two recursive calls \u2014 on sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ contains points to the left of the partition line and partially on it, $A_2$ contains the remaining points of the partition line and points to the right of it. For any pair of points from $A_1$, as well as from $A_2$, the distance can not be less than $h$ \u2014 otherwise it would mean incorrect operation of the recursive function.\n\n    To estimate the maximum number of points in the rectangle $2h \\times h$ we divide it into two squares $h \\times h$, the first square include all points $C(p_i) \\cap A_1$, and the second contains all the others, i.e. $C(p_i) \\cap A_2$. It follows from the above considerations that in each of these squares the distance between any two points is at least $h$.\n\n    We show that there are at most four points in each square. For example, this can be done as follows: divide the square into $4$ sub-squares with sides $h/2$. Then there can be no more than one point in each of these sub-squares (since even the diagonal is equal to $h / \\sqrt{2}$, which is less than $h$). Therefore, there can be no more than $4$ points in the whole square.\n\n    So, we have proved that in a rectangle $2h \\times h$ can not be more than $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ points, and, therefore, the size of the set $C(p_i)$ cannot exceed $7$, as required.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Josephus Problem\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Josephus Problem\n\n    ## Statement\n\n    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.\n    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. \n    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.\n    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.\n    The process stops when one number remains.\n    It is required to find the last number.\n\n    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).\n\n    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.\n    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
