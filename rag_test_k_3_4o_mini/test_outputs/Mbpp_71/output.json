    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that sorts a list of elements in increasing order. The function should take a list as input and return a new list that contains the same elements but sorted.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: To sort the list, we can use a simple sorting algorithm. One effective method is the Comb Sort algorithm, which is an improvement over Bubble Sort. It works by comparing elements that are far apart and gradually reducing the gap between them. This helps to move elements into their correct positions more quickly than traditional methods.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function comb_sort(array):\n       set gap to length of array divided by 1.3\n       set swapped to true\n       while swapped is true:\n           set swapped to false\n           for i from 0 to length of array - gap:\n               if array[i] > array[i + gap]:\n                   swap(array[i], array[i + gap])\n                   set swapped to true\n           if gap is greater than 1:\n               reduce gap by dividing it by 1.3\n       return array\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef comb_sort(array):\n    # Initialize the gap size\n    gap = len(array)\n    # Initialize swapped as True to enter the loop\n    swapped = True\n    \n    # Continue sorting while there are swaps\n    while gap > 1 or swapped:\n        # Update the gap for the next comparison\n        gap = max(1, int(gap / 1.3))\n        swapped = False\n        \n        # Compare elements with the current gap\n        for i in range(len(array) - gap):\n            if array[i] > array[i + gap]:\n                # Swap the elements if they are in the wrong order\n                array[i], array[i + gap] = array[i + gap], array[i]\n                swapped = True\n    \n    return array\n```",
