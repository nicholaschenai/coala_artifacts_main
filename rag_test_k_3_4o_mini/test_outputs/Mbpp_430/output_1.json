    "raw_msg": "Based on the insights gained from the previous analysis, I will correct the implementation of the `parabola_directrix` function to ensure it accurately calculates the directrix of a parabola given the parameters \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\nThe correct approach involves:\n1. Calculating the vertex of the parabola using the formula for the vertex \\(y\\)-coordinate.\n2. Using the correct formula for the directrix based on the vertex and the distance \\(p\\) from the vertex to the focus.\n\nHere is the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef parabola_directrix(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the vertex y-coordinate\n    vertex_y = (4 * a * c - b * b) / (4 * a)\n    # Calculate the distance p from the vertex to the focus\n    p = 1 / (4 * a)\n    # Calculate the directrix\n    directrix = vertex_y - p\n    # Return the directrix as an integer\n    return int(directrix)\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the calculation of the directrix based on the vertex of the parabola defined by the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The directrix is calculated as the vertex \\(y\\)-coordinate minus the distance \\(p\\).",
