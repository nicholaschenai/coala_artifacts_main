    Chapter: Data structures
    Section: Comparison to sorting
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Comparison to sorting}

    It is often possible to solve a problem
    using either data structures or sorting.
    Sometimes there are remarkable differences
    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,
    which may be hidden in their time complexities.

    Let us consider a problem where
    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$
    that both contain $n$ elements.
    Our task is to calculate the number of elements
    that belong to both of the lists.
    For example, for the lists
    \[A = [5,2,8,9] \hspace{10px} \textrm{and} \hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\]
    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5
    and 9 belong to both of the lists.

    A straightforward solution to the problem is
    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,
    but next we will focus on
    more efficient algorithms.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,
    and after this, we iterate through the elements
    of $B$ and check for each elements if it
    also belongs to $A$.
    This is efficient because the elements of $A$
    are in a set.
    Using the \texttt{set} structure,
    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,
    so instead of the \texttt{set} structure
    we can also use the \texttt{unordered\_set} structure.
    This is an easy way to make the algorithm
    more efficient, because we only have to change
    the underlying data structure.
    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.
    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.
    After this, we iterate through both the lists
    at the same time and find the common elements.
    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \log n)$,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,
    so the total time complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    The following table shows how efficient
    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and
    the elements of the lists are random
    integers between $1 \ldots 10^9$:

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\
    $2 \cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\
    $3 \cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\
    $4 \cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\
    $5 \cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that
    they use different set structures.
    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on
    the running time, because Algorithm 2
    is 4–5 times faster than Algorithm 1.

    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3
    which uses sorting.
    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.
    Interestingly, the time complexity of both
    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \log n)$,
    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.
    This can be explained by the fact that
    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done
    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,
    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.
    On the other hand,
    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree
    during the whole algorithm.

    Title: Finding the nearest pair of points
    Part: 1/3
    # Finding the nearest pair of points

    ## Problem statement

    Given $n$ points on the plane. Each point $p_i$ is defined by its coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$. It is required to find among them two such points, such that the distance between them is minimal:

    $$ \min_{\scriptstyle i, j=0 \ldots n-1,\atop \scriptstyle i \neq j } \rho (p_i, p_j). $$

    We take the usual Euclidean distances:

    $$ \rho (p_i,p_j) = \sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2} .$$

    The trivial algorithm - iterating over all pairs and calculating the distance for each — works in $O(n^2)$. 

    The algorithm running in time $O(n \log n)$ is described below. This algorithm was proposed by Shamos and Hoey in 1975. (Source: Ch. 5 Notes of _Algorithm Design_ by Kleinberg & Tardos, also see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4567872)) Preparata and Shamos also showed that this algorithm is optimal in the decision tree model.

    ## Algorithm
    We construct an algorithm according to the general scheme of **divide-and-conquer** algorithms: the algorithm is designed as a recursive function, to which we pass a set of points; this recursive function splits this set in half, calls itself recursively on each half, and then performs some operations to combine the answers. The operation of combining consist of  detecting the cases when one point of the optimal solution fell into one half, and the other point into the other (in this case, recursive calls from each of the halves cannot detect this pair separately). The main difficulty, as always in case of divide and conquer algorithms, lies in the effective implementation of the merging stage. If a set of $n$ points is passed to the recursive function, then the merge stage should work no more than $O(n)$, then the asymptotics of the whole algorithm $T(n)$ will be found from the equation:

    $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).$$ 

    The solution to this equation, as is known, is $T(n) = O(n \log n).$

    So, we proceed on to the construction of the algorithm. In order to come to an effective implementation of the merge stage in the future, we will divide the set of points into two subsets, according to their $x$-coordinates: In fact, we draw some vertical line dividing the set of points into two subsets of approximately the same size. It is convenient to make such a partition as follows: We sort the points in the standard way as pairs of numbers, ie.:

    $$p_i < p_j \Longleftrightarrow (x_i < x_j) \lor \Big(\left(x_i = x_j\right) \wedge \left(y_i < y_j \right) \Big) $$

    Then take the middle point after sorting $p_m (m = \lfloor n/2 \rfloor)$, and all the points before it and the $p_m$ itself are assigned to the first half, and all the points after it - to the second half:

    $$A_1 = \{p_i \ | \ i = 0 \ldots m \}$$

    $$A_2 = \{p_i \ | \ i = m + 1 \ldots n-1 \}.$$ 

    Now, calling recursively on each of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, we will find the answers $h_1$ and $h_2$ for each of the halves. And take the best of them: $h = \min(h_1, h_2)$.

    Now we need to make a **merge stage**, i.e. we try to find such pairs of points, for which the distance between which is less than $h$ and one point is lying in $A_1$ and the other in $A_2$.
    It is obvious that it is sufficient to consider only those points that are separated from the vertical line by a distance less than $h$, i.e. the set $B$ of the points considered at this stage is equal to:

    $$B = \{ p_i\ | \ | x_i - x_m\ | < h \}.$$ 

    For each point in the set $B$, we try to find the points that are closer to it than $h$. For example, it is sufficient to consider only those points whose $y$-coordinate differs by no more than $h$. Moreover, it makes no sense to consider those points whose $y$-coordinate is greater than the $y$-coordinate of the current point. Thus, for each point $p_i$ we define the set of considered points $C(p_i)$ as follows:

    $$C(p_i) = \{ p_j\ |\ p_j \in B,\ \ y_i - h < y_j \le y_i \}.$$

    If we sort the points of the set $B$ by $y$-coordinate, it will be very easy to find $C(p_i)$: these are several points in a row ahead to the point $p_i$.

    So, in the new notation, the **merging stage** looks like this: build a set $B$, sort the points in it by $y$-coordinate, then for each point $p_i \in B$ consider all points $p_j \in C(p_i)$, and for each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ calculate the distance and compare with the current best distance.

    At first glance, this is still a non-optimal algorithm: it seems that the sizes of sets $C(p_i)$ will be of order $n$, and the required asymptotics will not work. However, surprisingly, it can be proved that the size of each of the sets $C(p_i)$ is a quantity $O(1)$, i.e. it does not exceed some small constant regardless of the points themselves. Proof of this fact is given in the next section.

    Finally, we pay attention to the sorting, which the above algorithm contains: first,sorting by pairs $(x, y)$, and then second, sorting the elements of the set $B$ by $y$. In fact, both of these sorts inside the recursive function can be eliminated (otherwise we would not reach the $O(n)$ estimate for the **merging stage**, and the general asymptotics of the algorithm would be $O(n \log^2 n)$). It is easy to get rid of the first sort — it is enough to perform this sort before starting the recursion: after all, the elements themselves do not change inside the recursion, so there is no need to sort again. With the second sorting a little more difficult to perform, performing it previously will not work. But, remembering the merge sort, which also works on the principle of divide-and-conquer, we can simply embed this sort in our recursion. Let recursion, taking some set of points (as we remember,ordered by pairs $(x, y)$), return the same set, but sorted by the $y$-coordinate. To do this, simply merge (in $O(n)$) the two results returned by recursive calls. This will result in a set sorted by $y$-coordinate.

    ## Evaluation of the asymptotics

    To show that the above algorithm is actually executed in $O(n \log n)$, we need to prove the following fact: $|C(p_i)| = O(1)$.

    So, let us consider some point $p_i$; recall that the set $C(p_i)$ is a set of points whose $y$-coordinate lies in the segment $[y_i-h; y_i]$, and, moreover, along the $x$ coordinate, the point $p_i$ itself, and all the points of the set $C(p_i)$ lie in the band width $2h$. In other words, the points we are considering $p_i$ and $C(p_i)$ lie in a rectangle of size $2h \times h$.

    Our task is to estimate the maximum number of points that can lie in this rectangle $2h \times h$; thus, we estimate the maximum size of the set $C(p_i)$. At the same time, when evaluating, we must not forget that there may be repeated points.

    Remember that $h$ was obtained from the results of two recursive calls — on sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ contains points to the left of the partition line and partially on it, $A_2$ contains the remaining points of the partition line and points to the right of it. For any pair of points from $A_1$, as well as from $A_2$, the distance can not be less than $h$ — otherwise it would mean incorrect operation of the recursive function.

    To estimate the maximum number of points in the rectangle $2h \times h$ we divide it into two squares $h \times h$, the first square include all points $C(p_i) \cap A_1$, and the second contains all the others, i.e. $C(p_i) \cap A_2$. It follows from the above considerations that in each of these squares the distance between any two points is at least $h$.

    We show that there are at most four points in each square. For example, this can be done as follows: divide the square into $4$ sub-squares with sides $h/2$. Then there can be no more than one point in each of these sub-squares (since even the diagonal is equal to $h / \sqrt{2}$, which is less than $h$). Therefore, there can be no more than $4$ points in the whole square.

    So, we have proved that in a rectangle $2h \times h$ can not be more than $4 \cdot 2 = 8$ points, and, therefore, the size of the set $C(p_i)$ cannot exceed $7$, as required.
