INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/6 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if two given integers differ by exactly one bit in their binary representation. If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if two numbers differ by one bit, we can use the XOR operation. The XOR of two numbers will yield a binary number where each bit is set to `1` if the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different. If the result of the XOR operation has exactly one bit set to `1`, it means the two numbers differ by exactly one bit.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos` that takes two integers as input.
   - Calculate the XOR of the two integers.
   - Count the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the XOR result.
   - If the count of `1`s is exactly one, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:
```python
def count_set_bits(n):
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        count += n & 1  # Increment count if the last bit is 1
        n >>= 1         # Right shift n to check the next bit
    return count

def differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a: int, b: int) -> bool:
    xor_result = a ^ b  # Perform XOR operation
    return count_set_bits(xor_result) == 1  # Check if exactly one bit is set

    # Bit manipulation

    ## Binary number

    A **binary number** is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, it is a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).

    We say that a certain bit is **set**, if it is one, and **cleared** if it is zero.

    The binary number $(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2$ represents the number:

    $$(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2 = a_k \cdot 2^k + a_{k-1} \cdot 2^{k-1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot 2^1 + a_0 \cdot 2^0.$$

    For instance the binary number $1101_2$ represents the number $13$:

    $$\begin{align}
    1101_2 &= 1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 \\
           &= 1\cdot 8 + 1 \cdot 4 + 0 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 = 13
    \end{align}$$

    Computers represent integers as binary numbers.
    Positive integers (both signed and unsigned) are just represented with their binary digits, and negative signed numbers (which can be positive and negative) are usually represented with the [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).

    ```cpp
    unsigned int unsigned_number = 13;
    assert(unsigned_number == 0b1101);

    int positive_signed_number = 13;
    assert(positive_signed_number == 0b1101);

    int negative_signed_number = -13;
    assert(negative_signed_number == 0b1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'0011);
    ```

    CPUs are very fast manipulating those bits with specific operations.
    For some problems we can take these binary number representations to our advantage, and speed up the execution time.
    And for some problems (typically in combinatorics or dynamic programming) where we want to track which objects we already picked from a given set of objects, we can just use an large enough integer where each digit represents an object and depending on if we pick or drop the object we set or clear the digit.

    ## Bit operators

    All those introduced operators are instant (same speed as an addition) on a CPU for fixed-length integers.

    ### Bitwise operators

    -   $\&$ : The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand. 
        If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.
 	
    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.

    Examples:

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 01010000
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n | (n-1) = 01011111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    --------------------
    ~n        = 10100111
    ```

    ### Shift operators

    There are two operators for shifting bits.

    -   $\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.
        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \gg 2 = 101_2 \gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\frac{5}{2^2} = \frac{5}{4} = 1$.
        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.

    -   $\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.
        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \ll 3 = 101_2 \ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \cdot 2^3 = 5 \cdot 8 = 40$.

        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.


    ## Useful tricks

    ### Set/flip/clear a bit

    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.
    $1 \ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\sim(1 \ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.

    - $n ~|~ (1 \ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\wedge~ (1 \ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\&~ \sim(1 \ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$

    ### Check if a bit is set

    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.

    ``` cpp
    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {
        return (number >> x) & 1;
    }
    ```

    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2

    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).
    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.
    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.

    ``` cpp
    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {
        return n && !(n & (n - 1));
    }
    ```

    ### Clear the most-right set bit

    The expression $n ~\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.
    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.
    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.

    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:

    ```
    n         = 00110100
    n-1       = 00110011
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 00110000
    ```

    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm

    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.

    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.

    ``` cpp
    int countSetBits(int n)
    {
        int count = 0;
        while (n)
        {
            n = n & (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    Section: Bit optimizations
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Bit optimizations}

    Many algorithms can be optimized using
    bit operations.
    Such optimizations do not change the
    time complexity of the algorithm,
    but they may have a large impact
    on the actual running time of the code.
    In this section we discuss examples
    of such situations.

    \subsubsection{Hamming distances}

    \index{Hamming distance}
    The \key{Hamming distance}
    $\texttt{hamming}(a,b)$ between two
    strings $a$ and $b$ of equal length is
    the number of positions where the strings differ.
    For example,
    \[\texttt{hamming}(01101,11001)=2.\]

    Consider the following problem: Given
    a list of $n$ bit strings, each of length $k$,
    calculate the minimum Hamming distance
    between two strings in the list.
    For example, the answer for $[00111,01101,11110]$
    is 2, because
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item $\texttt{hamming}(00111,01101)=2$,
    \item $\texttt{hamming}(00111,11110)=3$, and
    \item $\texttt{hamming}(01101,11110)=3$.
    \end{itemize}

    A straightforward way to solve the problem is
    to go through all pairs of strings and calculate
    their Hamming distances,
    which yields an $O(n^2 k)$ time algorithm.
    The following function can be used to
    calculate distances:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int hamming(string a, string b) {
        int d = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (a[i] != b[i]) d++;
        }
        return d;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    However, if $k$ is small, we can optimize the code
    by storing the bit strings as integers and
    calculating the Hamming distances using bit operations.
    In particular, if $k \le 32$, we can just store
    the strings as \texttt{int} values and use the
    following function to calculate distances:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int hamming(int a, int b) {
        return __builtin_popcount(a^b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    In the above function, the xor operation constructs
    a bit string that has one bits in positions
    where $a$ and $b$ differ.
    Then, the number of bits is calculated using
    the \texttt{\_\_builtin\_popcount} function.

    To compare the implementations, we generated
    a list of 10000 random bit strings of length 30.
    Using the first approach, the search took
    13.5 seconds, and after the bit optimization,
    it only took 0.5 seconds.
    Thus, the bit optimized code was almost
    30 times faster than the original code.

    \subsubsection{Counting subgrids}

    As another example, consider the
    following problem:
    Given an $n \times n$ grid whose
    each square is either black (1) or white (0),
    calculate the number of subgrids
    whose all corners are black.
    For example, the grid
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \fill[black] (1,1) rectangle (2,2);
    \fill[black] (1,4) rectangle (2,5);
    \fill[black] (4,1) rectangle (5,2);
    \fill[black] (4,4) rectangle (5,5);
    \fill[black] (1,3) rectangle (2,4);
    \fill[black] (2,3) rectangle (3,4);
    \fill[black] (2,1) rectangle (3,2);
    \fill[black] (0,2) rectangle (1,3);
    \draw (0,0) grid (5,5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    contains two such subgrids:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.5]
    \fill[black] (1,1) rectangle (2,2);
    \fill[black] (1,4) rectangle (2,5);
    \fill[black] (4,1) rectangle (5,2);
    \fill[black] (4,4) rectangle (5,5);
    \fill[black] (1,3) rectangle (2,4);
    \fill[black] (2,3) rectangle (3,4);
    \fill[black] (2,1) rectangle (3,2);
    \fill[black] (0,2) rectangle (1,3);
    \draw (0,0) grid (5,5);

    \fill[black] (7+1,1) rectangle (7+2,2);
    \fill[black] (7+1,4) rectangle (7+2,5);
    \fill[black] (7+4,1) rectangle (7+5,2);
    \fill[black] (7+4,4) rectangle (7+5,5);
    \fill[black] (7+1,3) rectangle (7+2,4);
    \fill[black] (7+2,3) rectangle (7+3,4);
    \fill[black] (7+2,1) rectangle (7+3,2);
    \fill[black] (7+0,2) rectangle (7+1,3);
    \draw (7+0,0) grid (7+5,5);

    \draw[color=red,line width=1mm] (1,1) rectangle (3,4);
    \draw[color=red,line width=1mm] (7+1,1) rectangle (7+5,5);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    There is an $O(n^3)$ time algorithm for solving the problem:
    go through all $O(n^2)$ pairs of rows and for each pair
    $(a,b)$ calculate the number of columns that contain a black
    square in both rows in $O(n)$ time.
    The following code assumes that $\texttt{color}[y][x]$
    denotes the color in row $y$ and column $x$:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (color[a][i] == 1 && color[b][i] == 1) count++;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    Then, those columns
    account for $\texttt{count}(\texttt{count}-1)/2$ subgrids with black corners,
    because we can choose any two of them to form a subgrid.

    To optimize this algorithm, we divide the grid into blocks
    of columns such that each block consists of $N$
    consecutive columns. Then, each row is stored as
    a list of $N$-bit numbers that describe the colors
    of the squares. Now we can process $N$ columns at the same time
    using bit operations. In the following code,
    $\texttt{color}[y][k]$ represents
    a block of $N$ colors as bits.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n/N; i++) {
        count += __builtin_popcount(color[a][i]&color[b][i]);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    The resulting algorithm works in $O(n^3/N)$ time.

    We generated a random grid of size $2500 \times 2500$
    and compared the original and bit optimized implementation.
    While the original code took $29.6$ seconds,
    the bit optimized version only took $3.1$ seconds
    with $N=32$ (\texttt{int} numbers) and $1.7$ seconds
    with $N=64$ (\texttt{long long} numbers).

    ### Additional tricks

    - $n ~\&~ (n + 1)$ clears all trailing ones: $0011~0111_2 \rightarrow 0011~0000_2$.
    - $n ~|~ (n + 1)$ sets the last cleared bit: $0011~0101_2 \rightarrow 0011~0111_2$.
    - $n ~\&~ -n$ extracts the last set bit: $0011~0100_2 \rightarrow 0000~0100_2$.

    Many more can be found in the book [Hacker's Delight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker%27s_Delight).

    ### Language and compiler support

    C++ supports some of those operations since C++20 via the [bit](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/bit) standard library:

    - `has_single_bit`: checks if the number is a power of two
    - `bit_ceil` / `bit_floor`: round up/down to the next power of two
    - `rotl` / `rotr`: rotate the bits in the number
    - `countl_zero` / `countr_zero` / `countl_one` / `countr_one`: count the leading/trailing zeros/ones
    - `popcount`: count the number of set bits

    Additionally, there are also predefined functions in some compilers that help working with bits.
    E.g. GCC defines a list at [Built-in Functions Provided by GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html) that also work in older versions of C++:

    - `__builtin_popcount(unsigned int)` returns the number of set bits (`__builtin_popcount(0b0001'0010'1100) == 4`)
    - `__builtin_ffs(int)` finds the index of the first (most right) set bit (`__builtin_ffs(0b0001'0010'1100) == 3`)
    - `__builtin_clz(unsigned int)` the count of leading zeros (`__builtin_clz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 23`)
    - `__builtin_ctz(unsigned int)` the count of trailing zeros (`__builtin_ctz(0b0001'0010'1100) == 2`)

    _Note that some of the operations (both the C++20 functions and the Compiler Built-in ones) might be quite slow in GCC if you don't enable a specific compiler target with `#pragma GCC target("popcnt")`._

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/6 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that checks if two given integers differ by exactly one bit in their binary representation. If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To determine if two numbers differ by exactly one bit, we can use the XOR operation. The XOR of two numbers will yield a binary number where each bit is set to `1` if the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different. If the result of the XOR operation has exactly one bit set (i.e., it is a power of two), then the two numbers differ by exactly one bit.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function `differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a, b)`.
   - Compute the XOR of `a` and `b`.
   - Check if the result of the XOR operation is greater than zero and if it is a power of two (i.e., `result & (result - 1) == 0`).
   - Return `True` if both conditions are satisfied; otherwise, return `False`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def is_power_of_two(n):
    # Check if n is greater than 0 and if it is a power of two
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0

def differ_At_One_Bit_Pos(a: int, b: int) -> bool:
    # Calculate the XOR of a and b
    xor_result = a ^ b
    # Check if the XOR result is a power of two
