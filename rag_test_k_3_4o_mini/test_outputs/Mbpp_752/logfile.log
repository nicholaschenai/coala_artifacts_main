INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/752 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the nth Jacobsthal number. The sequence starts with 0, 1, and each subsequent number is derived from the previous two numbers in a specific way.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   The Jacobsthal numbers can be defined recursively:
   - The 0th Jacobsthal number is 0.
   - The 1st Jacobsthal number is 1.
   - For n >= 2, the nth Jacobsthal number can be calculated as:
     - jacobsthal_num(n) = jacobsthal_num(n-2) + 2 * jacobsthal_num(n-1).
   We can use a simple recursive function to compute this, but to improve efficiency, we can use an iterative approach to avoid recalculating values.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function jacobsthal_num(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 0
       if n == 1:
           return 1

       jacobsthal[0] = 0
       jacobsthal[1] = 1
       for i from 2 to n:
           jacobsthal[i] = jacobsthal[i-2] + 2 * jacobsthal[i-1]
       return jacobsthal[n]
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution**:

def jacobsthal_num(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases for the Jacobsthal sequence
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    # Return the nth Jacobsthal number
    return jacobsthal[n]

    Title: Josephus Problem
    Part: 1/1
    # Josephus Problem

    ## Statement

    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.
    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. 
    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.
    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.
    The process stops when one number remains.
    It is required to find the last number.

    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).

    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.
    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \log n)$.
    We want something better though.

    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution

    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.

    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:

    $$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
    n\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\
    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\
    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\
    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\
    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\
    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\
    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\
    \end{array}$$

    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:

    $$J_{n,k} = \left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \bmod n \right) + 1$$

    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$

    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:

    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \bmod n$$

    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.

    ## Implementation

    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;
    }
    ```

    **Non-recursive form** :

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
      	  res = (res + k) % i;
        return res + 1;
    }
    ```

    This formula can also be found analytically.
    Again here we assume 0-indexing.
    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.
    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \bmod n$.
    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \ \bmod n$.

    ## Modeling a $O(k \log n)$ solution

    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.
    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$) in one run without looping over.
    Afterwards we have $n - \lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k)$-th number.
    So we have to shift by that many.
    We can notice that $\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k$ is simply $-n \bmod k$.
    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.
    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.

    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.

    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;
        if (k == 1)
            return n-1;
        if (k > n)
            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;
        int cnt = n / k;
        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);
        res -= n % k;
        if (res < 0)
            res += n;
        else
            res += res / (k - 1);
        return res;
    }
    ```

    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:

    $$ n \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) ^ x = 1, $$

    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:

    $$\ln n + x \ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) = 0,$$ 
    $$x = - \frac{\ln n}{\ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)},$$

    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:

    $$x \approx k \ln n$$

    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \log n)$.

    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$

    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.

    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):

    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$

    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:

    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$

    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, "restarting" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:

    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \left(n-2^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor} \right)$$

    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$

    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler "The Josephus Problem" and Odlyzko, Wilf "Functional iteration and the Josephus problem").

    Title: Catalan Numbers
    Part: 1/1
    # Catalan Numbers
    Catalan numbers is a number sequence, which is found useful in a number of combinatorial problems, often involving recursively-defined objects.

    This sequence was named after the Belgian mathematician [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan), who lived in the 19th century. (In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).

    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):

     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \ldots$

    ### Application in some combinatorial problems

    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for

    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.
    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.
    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.
    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).
    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.
    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).
    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).
    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).
    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.
    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).


    ## Calculations

    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.

    ### Recursive formula
 
    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$

    $$C_n = \sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \geq 2$$

    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.

    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.

    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :

    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.

    #### C++ implementation 

    ```cpp
    const int MOD = ....
    const int MAX = ....
    int catalan[MAX];
    void init() {
        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;
        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {
            catalan[i] = 0;
            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {
                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;
                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {
                    catalan[i] -= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Analytical formula

    $$C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1} {\binom{2n}{n}}$$

    (here $\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).

    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \times n$ is given by $\binom{2n}{n}$.

    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \times n$.

    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$ are $\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as "bad" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above "bad" paths, obtaining the formula:

    $$C_n = \binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n + 1} \binom{2n}{n} , {n} \geq 0$$

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/752 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the nth Jacobsthal number. The Jacobsthal numbers form a sequence starting with 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, and so on. The goal is to return the value at the nth position in this sequence.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: The Jacobsthal numbers can be defined recursively. The first two numbers are 0 and 1. For any number n greater than 1, the nth Jacobsthal number can be calculated using the formula:
   - J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2)
   This means that to find the nth number, we need to find the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers and apply the formula.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function jacobsthal_num(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 0
       if n == 1:
           return 1
       return jacobsthal_num(n-1) + 2 * jacobsthal_num(n-2)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a helper function to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number recursively
def jacobsthal_helper(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0  # Base case: J(0) = 0
    if n == 1:

INFO - raw_msg:
 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the nth Jacobsthal number. The Jacobsthal numbers form a sequence starting with 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, and so on. The goal is to return the value at the nth position in this sequence.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: The Jacobsthal numbers can be defined recursively. The first two numbers are 0 and 1. For any number n greater than 1, the nth Jacobsthal number can be calculated using the formula:
   - J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2)
   This means that to find the nth number, we need to find the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers and apply the formula.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function jacobsthal_num(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 0
       if n == 1:
           return 1
       return jacobsthal_num(n-1) + 2 * jacobsthal_num(n-2)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a helper function to calculate the nth Jacobsthal number recursively
def jacobsthal_helper(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0  # Base case: J(0) = 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1  # Base case: J(1) = 1
    # Recursive case: J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2)
    return jacobsthal_helper(n - 1) + 2 * jacobsthal_helper(n - 2)

# Main function to find the nth Jacobsthal number
def jacobsthal_num(n: int) -> int:
    return jacobsthal_helper(n)  # Call the helper function
