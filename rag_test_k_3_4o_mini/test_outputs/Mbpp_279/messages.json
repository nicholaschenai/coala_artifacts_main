You are required to count the number of triples $2 \\le a < b < c \\le n$ that satisfy one of the following conditions:\n\n    * or ${\\rm gcd}(a,b) = {\\rm gcd}(a,c) = {\\rm gcd}(b,c) = 1$,\n    * or ${\\rm gcd}(a,b) > 1, {\\rm gcd}(a,c) > 1, {\\rm gcd}(b,c) > 1$.\n\n    First, go straight to the inverse problem \u2014 i.e. count the number of non-harmonic triples.\n\n    Second, note that any non-harmonic triplet is made of a pair of coprimes and a third number that is not coprime with at least one from the pair.\n\n    Thus, the number of non-harmonic triples that contain $i$ is equal the number of integers from $2$ to $n$ that are coprimes with $i$ multiplied by the number of integers that are not coprime with $i$.\n\n    Either $gcd(a,b) = 1 \\wedge gcd(a,c) > 1 \\wedge gcd(b,c) > 1$\n\n    or $gcd(a,b) = 1 \\wedge gcd(a,c) = 1 \\wedge gcd(b,c) > 1$\n\n    In both of these cases, it will be counted twice. The first case will be counted when $i = a$ and when $i = b$. The second case will be counted when $i = b$ and when $i = c$. Therefore, to compute the number of non-harmonic triples, we sum this calculation through all $i$ from $2$ to $n$ and divide it by $2$.\n\n    Now all we have left to solve is to learn to count the number of coprimes to $i$ in the interval $[2;n]$. Although this problem has already been mentioned, the above solution is not suitable here \u2014 it would require the factorization of each of the integers from $2$ to $n$, and then iterating through all subsets of these primes.\n\n    A faster solution is possible with such modification of the sieve of Eratosthenes:\n\n    1. First, we find all numbers in the interval $[2;n]$ such that its simple factorization does not include a prime factor twice. We will also need to know, for these numbers, how many factors it includes.\n        * To do this we will maintain an array $deg[i]$ to store the number of primes in the factorization of $i$, and an array $good[i]$, to mark either if $i$ contains each factor at most once ($good[i] = 1$) or not ($good[i] = 0$). When iterating from $2$ to $n$, if we reach a number that has $deg$ equal to $0$, then it is a prime and its $deg$ is $1$.\n        * During the sieve of Eratosthenes, we will iterate $i$ from $2$ to $n$. When processing a prime number we go through all of its multiples and increase their $deg[]$. If one of these multiples is multiple of the square of $i$, then we can put $good$ as false.\n\n    2. Second, we need to calculate the answer for all $i$ from $2$ to $n$, i.e., the array $cnt[]$ \u2014 the number of integers not coprime with $i$.\n        * To do this, remember how the formula of inclusion-exclusion works \u2014 actually here we implement the same concept, but with inverted logic: we iterate over a component (a product of primes from the factorization) and add or subtract its term on the formula of inclusion-exclusion of each of its multiples.\n        * So, let's say we are processing a number $i$ such that $good[i] = true$, i.e., it is involved in the formula of inclusion-exclusion. Iterate through all numbers that are multiples of $i$, and either add or subtract $\\lfloor N/i \\rfloor$ from their $cnt[]$ (the signal depends on $deg[i]$: if $deg[i]$ is odd, then we must add, otherwise subtract).\n\n    Here's a C++ implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int n;\n    bool good[MAXN];\n    int deg[MAXN], cnt[MAXN];\n\n    long long solve() {\n    \tmemset (good, 1, sizeof good);\n    \tmemset (deg, 0, sizeof deg);\n    \tmemset (cnt, 0, sizeof cnt);\n\n    \tlong long ans_bad = 0;\n    \tfor (int i=2; i<=n; ++i) {\n    \t\tif (good[i]) {\n    \t\t\tif (deg[i] == 0)  deg[i] = 1;\n    \t\t\tfor (int j=1; i*j<=n; ++j) {\n    \t\t\t\tif (j > 1 && deg[i] == 1)\n    \t\t\t\t\tif (j % i == 0)\n    \t\t\t\t\t\tgood[i*j] = false;\n    \t\t\t\t\telse\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t++deg[i*j];\n    \t\t\t\tcnt[i*j] += (n / i) * (deg[i]%2==1 ? +1 : -1);\n    \t\t\t}\n    \t\t}\n    \t\tans_bad += (cnt[i] - 1) * 1ll * (n-1 - cnt[i]);\n    \t}\n\n    \treturn (n-1) * 1ll * (n-2) * (n-3) / 6 - ans_bad / 2;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Catalan Numbers\n    Part: 1/1\n    # Catalan Numbers\n    Catalan numbers is a number sequence, which is found useful in a number of combinatorial problems, often involving recursively-defined objects.\n\n    This sequence was named after the Belgian mathematician [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan), who lived in the 19th century. (In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).\n\n    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):\n\n     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \\ldots$\n\n    ### Application in some combinatorial problems\n\n    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for\n\n    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.\n    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.\n    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.\n    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).\n    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.\n    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).\n    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \\times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).\n    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).\n    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.\n    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \\ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).\n\n\n    ## Calculations\n\n    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.\n\n    ### Recursive formula\n \n    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$\n\n    $$C_n = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \\geq 2$$\n\n    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.\n\n    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :\n\n    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.\n\n    #### C++ implementation \n\n    ```cpp\n    const int MOD = ....\n    const int MAX = ....\n    int catalan[MAX];\n    void init() {\n        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;\n        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {\n            catalan[i] = 0;\n            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {\n                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;\n                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {\n                    catalan[i] -= MOD;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ### Analytical formula\n\n    $$C_n = \\frac{1}{n + 1} {\\binom{2n}{n}}$$\n\n    (here $\\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).\n\n    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \\times n$ is given by $\\binom{2n}{n}$.\n\n    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \\times n$.\n\n    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \\times (n + 1)$ are $\\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as \"bad\" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above \"bad\" paths, obtaining the formula:\n\n    $$C_n = \\binom{2n}{n} - \\binom{2n}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{n + 1} \\binom{2n}{n} , {n} \\geq 0$$\n\n    ## Reference\n\n    - [Catalan Number by Tom Davis](http://www.geometer.org/mathcircles/catalan.pdf)\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
