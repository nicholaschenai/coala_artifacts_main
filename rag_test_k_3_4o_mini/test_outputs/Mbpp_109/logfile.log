INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/109 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a binary string and a number of rotations as input. The function should determine how many unique binary strings can be formed by rotating the original string the specified number of times, and then count how many of these strings have an odd decimal value when interpreted as binary.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - First, we will generate all possible rotations of the binary string.
   - For each rotation, we will convert the binary string to its decimal equivalent.
   - We will check if the decimal value is odd.
   - Finally, we will count how many of these values are odd and return that count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function odd_Equivalent(binary_string: str, rotations: int) -> int:
       create an empty set to store unique odd values
       for i from 0 to rotations - 1:
           rotate the binary string to the right by i positions
           convert the rotated string to decimal
           if the decimal value is odd:
               add it to the set of unique odd values
       return the size of the set of unique odd values
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def rotate_string(s: str, n: int) -> str:
    # Rotate the string s to the right by n positions
    n = n % len(s)  # To handle cases where n is greater than the length of s
    return s[-n:] + s[:-n]

def odd_Equivalent(binary_string: str, rotations: int) -> int:
    # Create a set to store unique odd decimal values
    odd_values = set()
    
    # Generate all rotations and check their decimal values
    for i in range(rotations):
        rotated = rotate_string(binary_string, i)
        decimal_value = int(rotated, 2)  # Convert binary string to decimal
        if decimal_value % 2 == 1:  # Check if the decimal value is odd
            odd_values.add(decimal_value)  # Add to the set of unique odd values
    
    # Return the count of unique odd values
    return len(odd_values)

    # Bit manipulation

    ## Binary number

    A **binary number** is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, it is a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).

    We say that a certain bit is **set**, if it is one, and **cleared** if it is zero.

    The binary number $(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2$ represents the number:

    $$(a_k a_{k-1} \dots a_1 a_0)_2 = a_k \cdot 2^k + a_{k-1} \cdot 2^{k-1} + \dots + a_1 \cdot 2^1 + a_0 \cdot 2^0.$$

    For instance the binary number $1101_2$ represents the number $13$:

    $$\begin{align}
    1101_2 &= 1 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^0 \\
           &= 1\cdot 8 + 1 \cdot 4 + 0 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 1 = 13
    \end{align}$$

    Computers represent integers as binary numbers.
    Positive integers (both signed and unsigned) are just represented with their binary digits, and negative signed numbers (which can be positive and negative) are usually represented with the [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).

    ```cpp
    unsigned int unsigned_number = 13;
    assert(unsigned_number == 0b1101);

    int positive_signed_number = 13;
    assert(positive_signed_number == 0b1101);

    int negative_signed_number = -13;
    assert(negative_signed_number == 0b1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'1111'0011);
    ```

    CPUs are very fast manipulating those bits with specific operations.
    For some problems we can take these binary number representations to our advantage, and speed up the execution time.
    And for some problems (typically in combinatorics or dynamic programming) where we want to track which objects we already picked from a given set of objects, we can just use an large enough integer where each digit represents an object and depending on if we pick or drop the object we set or clear the digit.

    ## Bit operators

    All those introduced operators are instant (same speed as an addition) on a CPU for fixed-length integers.

    ### Bitwise operators

    -   $\&$ : The bitwise AND operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand. 
        If both bits are 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.
 	
    -   $|$ : The bitwise inclusive OR operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one of the two bits is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\wedge$ : The bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) operator compares each bit of its first operand with the corresponding bit of its second operand.
        If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0.

    -   $\sim$ : The bitwise complement (NOT) operator flips each bit of a number, if a bit is set the operator will clear it, if it is cleared the operator sets it.

    Examples:

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 01010000
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n | (n-1) = 01011111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    n-1       = 01010111
    --------------------
    n ^ (n-1) = 00001111
    ```

    ```
    n         = 01011000
    --------------------
    ~n        = 10100111
    ```

    ### Shift operators

    There are two operators for shifting bits.

    -   $\gg$ Shifts a number to the right by removing the last few binary digits of the number.
        Each shift by one represents an integer division by 2, so a right shift by $k$ represents an integer division by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \gg 2 = 101_2 \gg 2 = 1_2 = 1$ which is the same as $\frac{5}{2^2} = \frac{5}{4} = 1$.
        For a computer though shifting some bits is a lot faster than doing divisions.

    -   $\ll$ Shifts a number to left by appending zero digits.
        In similar fashion to a right shift by $k$, a left shift by $k$ represents a multiplication by $2^k$.

        E.g. $5 \ll 3 = 101_2 \ll 3 = 101000_2 = 40$ which is the same as $5 \cdot 2^3 = 5 \cdot 8 = 40$.

        Notice however that for a fixed-length integer that means dropping the most left digits, and if you shift too much you end up with the number $0$.


    ## Useful tricks

    ### Set/flip/clear a bit

    Using bitwise shifts and some basic bitwise operations we can easily set, flip or clear a bit.
    $1 \ll x$ is a number with only the $x$-th bit set, while $\sim(1 \ll x)$ is a number with all bits set except the $x$-th bit.

    - $n ~|~ (1 \ll x)$ sets the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\wedge~ (1 \ll x)$ flips the $x$-th bit in the number $n$
    - $n ~\&~ \sim(1 \ll x)$ clears the $x$-th bit in the number $n$

    ### Check if a bit is set

    The value of the $x$-th bit can be checked by shifting the number $x$ positions to the right, so that the $x$-th bit is at the unit place, after which we can extract it by performing a bitwise & with 1.

    ``` cpp
    bool is_set(unsigned int number, int x) {
        return (number >> x) & 1;
    }
    ```

    ### Check if an integer is a power of 2

    A power of two is a number that has only a single bit in it (e.g. $32 = 0010~0000_2$), while the predecessor of that number has that digit not set and all the digits after it set ($31 = 0001~1111_2$).
    So the bitwise AND of a number with it's predecessor will always be 0, as they don't have any common digits set.
    You can easily check that this only happens for the the power of twos and for the number $0$ which already has no digit set.

    ``` cpp
    bool isPowerOfTwo(unsigned int n) {
        return n && !(n & (n - 1));
    }
    ```

    ### Clear the most-right set bit

    The expression $n ~\&~ (n-1)$ can be used to turn off the rightmost set bit of a number $n$.
    This works because the expression $n-1$ flips all bits after the rightmost set bit of $n$, including the rightmost set bit.
    So all those digits are different from the original number, and by doing a bitwise AND they are all set to 0, giving you the original number $n$ with the rightmost set bit flipped.

    For example, consider the number $52 = 0011~0100_2$:

    ```
    n         = 00110100
    n-1       = 00110011
    --------------------
    n & (n-1) = 00110000
    ```

    ### Brian Kernighan's algorithm

    We can count the number of bits set with the above expression.

    The idea is to consider only the set bits of an integer by turning off its rightmost set bit (after counting it), so the next iteration of the loop considers the Next Rightmost bit.

    ``` cpp
    int countSetBits(int n)
    {
        int count = 0;
        while (n)
        {
            n = n & (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 3/5
    ```

    Asymptotics of the solution is $O (\sqrt{n})$.

    ### The number of integers in a given interval which are multiple of at least one of the given numbers

    Given $n$ numbers $a_i$ and number $r$. You want to count the number of integers in the interval $[1; r]$ that are multiple of at least one of the $a_i$.

    The solution algorithm is almost identical to the one for previous task — construct the formula of inclusion-exclusion on the numbers $a_i$, i.e. each term in this formula is the number of numbers divisible by a given subset of numbers $a_i$ (in other words, divisible by their [least common multiple](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md)).

    So we will now iterate over all $2^n$ subsets of integers $a_i$ with $O(n \log r)$ operations to find their least common multiple, adding or subtracting the number of multiples of it in the interval. Asymptotics is $O (2^n\cdot n\cdot \log r)$.

    ### The number of strings that satisfy a given pattern

    Consider $n$ patterns of strings of the same length, consisting only of letters ($a...z$) or question marks. You're also given a number $k$. A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. The task is to count the number of strings that match exactly $k$ of the patterns (first problem) and at least $k$ of the patterns (second problem).

    Notice first that we can easily count the number of strings that satisfy at once all of the specified patterns. To do this, simply "cross" patterns: iterate though the positions ("slots") and look at a position over all patterns. If all patterns have a question mark in this position, the character can be any letter from $a$ to $z$. Otherwise, the character of this position is uniquely defined by the patterns that do not contain a question mark.

    Learn now to solve the first version of the problem: when the string must satisfy exactly $k$ of the patterns.

    To solve it, iterate and fix a specific subset $X$ from the set of patterns consisting of $k$ patterns. Then we have to count the number of strings that satisfy this set of patterns, and only matches it, that is, they don't match any other pattern. We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a slightly different manner: we sum on all supersets $Y$ (subsets from the original set of strings that contain $X$), and either add to the current answer or subtract it from the number of strings:

    $$ ans(X) = \sum_{Y \supseteq X} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Where $f(Y)$ is the number of strings that match $Y$ (at least $Y$).

    (If you have a hard time figuring out this, you can try drawing Venn Diagrams.)

    If we sum up on all $ans(X)$, we will get the final answer:

    $$ ans = \sum_{X ~ : ~ |X| = k} ans(X) $$

    However, asymptotics of this solution is $O(3^k \cdot k)$. To improve it, notice that different $ans(X)$ computations very often share $Y$ sets.

    We will reverse the formula of inclusion-exclusion and sum in terms of $Y$ sets. Now it becomes clear that the same set $Y$ would be taken into account in the computation of $ans(X)$ of $\binom{|Y|}{k}$ sets with the same sign $(-1)^{|Y| - k}$.

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Now our solution has asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    We will now solve the second version of the problem: find the number of strings that match **at least** $k$ of the patterns.

    Of course, we can just use the solution to the first version of the problem and add the answers for sets with size greater than $k$. However, you may notice that in this problem, a set |Y| is considered in the formula for all sets with size $\ge k$ which are contained in $Y$. That said, we can write the part of the expression that is being multiplied by $f(Y)$ as:


    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-1} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+1} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-2} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+2} + \cdots + (-1)^{|Y|-|Y|} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{|Y|} $$

    Looking at Graham's (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. "Concrete mathematics" [1998] ), we see a well-known formula for [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \cdot \binom{n}{k} = (-1)^m \cdot \binom{n-1}{m} $$

    Applying it here, we find that the entire sum of binomial coefficients is minimized:

    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} $$

    Thus, for this task, we also obtained a solution with the asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$:

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    ### The number of ways of going from a cell to another

    There is a field $n \times m$, and $k$ of its cells are impassable walls. A robot is initially at the cell $(1,1)$ (bottom left). The robot can only move right or up, and eventually it needs to get into the cell $(n,m)$, avoiding all obstacles. You need to count the number of ways he can do it.

    Assume that the sizes $n$ and $m$ are very large (say, $10^9$), and the number $k$ is small (around $100$).

    For now, sort the obstacles by their coordinate $x$, and in case of equality — coordinate $y$.

    Also just learn how to solve a problem without obstacles: i.e. learn how to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another. In one axis, we need to go through $x$ cells, and on the other, $y$ cells. From simple combinatorics, we get a formula using [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$\binom{x+y}{x}$$

    Now to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another, avoiding all obstacles, you can use inclusion-exclusion to solve the inverse problem: count the number of ways to walk through the board stepping at a subset of obstacles (and subtract it from the total number of ways).

    When iterating over a subset of the obstacles that we'll step, to count the number of ways to do this simply multiply the number of all paths from starting cell to the first of the selected obstacles, a first obstacle to the second, and so on, and then add or subtract this number from the answer, in accordance with the standard formula of inclusion-exclusion.

    However, this will again be non-polynomial in complexity $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    Here goes a polynomial solution:

    We will use dynamic programming. For convenience, push (1,1) to the beginning and (n,m) at the end of the obstacles array. Let's compute the numbers $d[i]$ — the number of ways to get from the starting point ($0-th$) to $i-th$, without stepping on any other obstacle (except for $i$, of course). We will compute this number for all the obstacle cells, and also for the ending one.

    Let's forget for a second the obstacles and just count the number of paths from cell $0$ to $i$. We need to consider some "bad" paths, the ones that pass through the obstacles, and subtract them from the total number of ways of going from $0$ to $i$.

    When considering an obstacle $t$ between $0$ and $i$ ($0 < t < i$), on which we can step, we see that the number of paths from $0$ to $i$ that pass through $t$ which have $t$ as the **first obstacle between start and $i$**. We can compute that as: $d[t]$ multiplied by the number of arbitrary paths from $t$ to $i$. We can count the number of "bad" ways summing this for all $t$ between $0$ and $i$.

    We can compute $d[i]$ in $O(k)$ for $O(k)$ obstacles, so this solution has complexity $O(k^2)$.

    ### The number of coprime quadruples

    You're given $n$ numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You are required to count the number of ways to choose four numbers so that their combined greatest common divisor is equal to one.

    We will solve the inverse problem — compute the number of "bad" quadruples, i.e. quadruples in which all numbers are divisible by a number $d > 1$.

    We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle while summing over all possible groups of four numbers divisible by a divisor $d$.

    $$ans = \sum_{d \ge 2} (-1)^{deg(d)-1} \cdot f(d)$$

    **Note:** This task can be solved more efficiently in linear time by building the permutation graph and considering each cycle independently. You could then compute $k$ modulo the size of the cycle and find the final position for each number which is part of this cycle.

    ### Fast application of a set of geometric operations to a set of points

    **Problem:** Given $n$ points $p_i$, apply $m$ transformations to each of these points. Each transformation can be a shift, a scaling or a rotation around a given axis by a given angle. There is also a "loop" operation which applies a given list of transformations $k$ times ("loop" operations can be nested). You should apply all transformations faster than $O(n \cdot length)$, where $length$ is the total number of transformations to be applied (after unrolling "loop" operations).

    **Solution:** Let's look at how the different types of transformations change the coordinates:

    * Shift operation: adds a different constant to each of the coordinates.
    * Scaling operation: multiplies each of the coordinates by a different constant.
    * Rotation operation: the transformation is more complicated (we won't go in details here), but each of the new coordinates still can be represented as a linear combination of the old ones.

    As you can see, each of the transformations can be represented as a linear operation on the coordinates. Thus, a transformation can be written as a $4 \times 4$ matrix of the form:

    $$\begin{pmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_ {12} & a_ {13} & a_ {14} \\
    a_{21} & a_ {22} & a_ {23} & a_ {24} \\
    a_{31} & a_ {32} & a_ {33} & a_ {34} \\
    a_{41} & a_ {42} & a_ {43} & a_ {44}
    \end{pmatrix}$$

    that, when multiplied by a vector with the old coordinates and an unit gives a new vector with the new coordinates and an unit:

    $$\begin{pmatrix} x & y & z & 1 \end{pmatrix} \cdot
    \begin{pmatrix}
    a_{11} & a_ {12} & a_ {13} & a_ {14} \\
    a_{21} & a_ {22} & a_ {23} & a_ {24} \\
    a_{31} & a_ {32} & a_ {33} & a_ {34} \\
    a_{41} & a_ {42} & a_ {43} & a_ {44}
    \end{pmatrix}
     = \begin{pmatrix} x' & y' & z' & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

    (Why introduce a fictitious fourth coordinate, you ask? That is the beauty of [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates), which find great application in computer graphics. Without this, it would not be possible to implement affine operations like the shift operation as a single matrix multiplication, as it requires us to _add_ a constant to the coordinates. The affine transformation becomes a linear transformation in the higher dimension!)

    Here are some examples of how transformations are represented in matrix form:

    * Shift operation: shift $x$ coordinate by $5$, $y$ coordinate by $7$ and $z$ coordinate by $9$.

    $$\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    5 & 7 & 9 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}$$

    * Scaling operation: scale the $x$ coordinate by $10$ and the other two by $5$.

    $$\begin{pmatrix}
    10 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 5 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 5 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}$$

    * Rotation operation: rotate $\theta$ degrees around the $x$ axis following the right-hand rule (counter-clockwise direction).

    $$\begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & \cos \theta & -\sin \theta & 0 \\
    0 & \sin \theta & \cos \theta & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}$$

    Now, once every transformation is described as a matrix, the sequence of transformations can be described as a product of these matrices, and a "loop" of $k$ repetitions can be described as the matrix raised to the power of $k$ (which can be calculated using binary exponentiation in $O(\log{k})$). This way, the matrix which represents all transformations can be calculated first in $O(m \log{k})$, and then it can be applied to each of the $n$ points in $O(n)$ for a total complexity of $O(n + m \log{k})$.


    ### Number of paths of length $k$ in a graph { data-toc-label='Number of paths of length <script type="math/tex">k</script> in a graph' }

    **Problem:** Given a directed unweighted graph of $n$ vertices, find the number of paths of length $k$ from any vertex $u$ to any other vertex $v$.

    **Solution:** This problem is considered in more detail in [a separate article](../graph/fixed_length_paths.md). The algorithm consists of raising the adjacency matrix $M$ of the graph (a matrix where $m_{ij} = 1$ if there is an edge from $i$ to $j$, or $0$ otherwise) to the $k$-th power. Now $m_{ij}$ will be the number of paths of length $k$ from $i$ to $j$. The time complexity of this solution is $O(n^3 \log k)$.

    **Note:** In that same article, another variation of this problem is considered: when the edges are weighted and it is required to find the minimum weight path containing exactly $k$ edges. As shown in that article, this problem is also solved by exponentiation of the adjacency matrix. The matrix would have the weight of the edge from $i$ to $j$, or $\infty$ if there is no such edge.
    Instead of the usual operation of multiplying two matrices, a modified one should be used:
    instead of multiplication, both values are added, and instead of a summation, a minimum is taken.
    That is: $result_{ij} = \min\limits_{1\ \leq\ k\ \leq\ n}(a_{ik} + b_{kj})$.

    ### Variation of binary exponentiation: multiplying two numbers modulo $m$ { data-toc-label='Variation of binary exponentiation: multiplying two numbers modulo <script type="math/tex">m</script>' }

    **Problem:** Multiply two numbers $a$ and $b$ modulo $m$. $a$ and $b$ fit in the built-in data types, but their product is too big to fit in a 64-bit integer. The idea is to compute $a \cdot b \pmod m$ without using bignum arithmetics.

    **Solution:** We simply apply the binary construction algorithm described above, only performing additions instead of multiplications. In other words, we have "expanded" the multiplication of two numbers to $O (\log m)$ operations of addition and multiplication by two (which, in essence, is an addition).

    $$a \cdot b = \begin{cases}
    0 &\text{if }a = 0 \\
    2 \cdot \frac{a}{2} \cdot b &\text{if }a > 0 \text{ and }a \text{ even} \\
    2 \cdot \frac{a-1}{2} \cdot b + b &\text{if }a > 0 \text{ and }a \text{ odd}
    \end{cases}$$

    **Note:** You can solve this task in a different way by using floating-point operations. First compute the expression $\frac{a \cdot b}{m}$ using floating-point numbers and cast it to an unsigned integer $q$. Subtract $q \cdot m$ from $a \cdot b$ using unsigned integer arithmetics and take it modulo $m$ to find the answer. This solution looks rather unreliable, but it is very fast, and very easy to implement. See [here](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/77016/modular-multiplication) for more information.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/109 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   The task is to create a function that counts how many numbers in a binary string have an odd value after rotating the string a specified number of times. The rotation means moving the last bit of the string to the front.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Generate all unique rotations of the binary string.
   - Convert each rotated binary string to its decimal equivalent.
   - Count how many of these decimal values are odd.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function odd_Equivalent(binary_string, rotations):
       unique_rotations = set()
       length = length of binary_string
       
       for i from 0 to rotations - 1:
           rotated_string = binary_string[-i:] + binary_string[:-i]
           add rotated_string to unique_rotations
       
       odd_count = 0
       for each string in unique_rotations:
           if int(string, 2) % 2 != 0:
               odd_count += 1
