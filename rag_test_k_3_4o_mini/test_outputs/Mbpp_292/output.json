    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a Python function that takes two integers as input and returns the quotient of the first integer divided by the second integer, rounded down to the nearest whole number.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To find the quotient of two numbers rounded down, we can use integer division in Python. The `//` operator performs floor division, which gives us the quotient without any remainder. This is exactly what we need to solve the problem.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function find(a, b):\n       return a // b\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef find(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Perform integer division to get the quotient rounded down\n    return a // b\n```",
