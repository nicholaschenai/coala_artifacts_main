INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/618 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers and divides the corresponding elements of the first list by the elements of the second list. The result should be a new list containing the results of these divisions.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will define a function that accepts two lists as input.
   - We will iterate through both lists simultaneously, dividing each element of the first list by the corresponding element of the second list.
   - We will store the results of these divisions in a new list.
   - Finally, we will return the new list containing the results.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function div_list(list1, list2):
       create an empty result list
       for each index i from 0 to length of list1:
           divide list1[i] by list2[i] and append the result to the result list
       return the result list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def div_list(list1, list2):
    # Create an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through both lists using their indices
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Divide the elements of the first list by the corresponding elements of the second list
        division_result = list1[i] / list2[i]
        # Append the result to the result list
        result.append(division_result)
    
    # Return the final list containing the division results
    return result

        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.

            x, k = map(int, input().split())

            mod = 10**9+7

            # apply ak + 1/x = (ak*x+1)/(1x+0) to (Ax + B) / (Cx + D)

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

The result should be a new list where each element is the result of dividing the element from the first list by the corresponding element from the second list.
