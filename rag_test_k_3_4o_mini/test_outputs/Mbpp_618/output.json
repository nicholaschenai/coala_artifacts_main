    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes two lists of numbers and divides the corresponding elements of these lists. The result should be a new list where each element is the result of dividing the element from the first list by the corresponding element from the second list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we will iterate through both lists simultaneously. For each pair of elements (one from each list), we will perform the division and store the result in a new list. We need to ensure that we handle the case where the second list has a zero, as division by zero is not allowed.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function div_list(list1, list2):\n       create an empty result list\n       for each index i from 0 to length of list1:\n           if list2[i] is not zero:\n               append list1[i] divided by list2[i] to result\n           else:\n               append None or some error value to result (to handle division by zero)\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef div_list(list1, list2):\n    # Create an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate through both lists using their indices\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Check if the denominator is not zero to avoid division by zero\n        if list2[i] != 0:\n            # Perform the division and append the result to the result list\n            result.append(list1[i] / list2[i])\n        else:\n            # Append None or handle division by zero as needed\n            result.append(None)  # or raise an error, depending on requirements\n    \n    # Return the final result list\n    return result\n```",
