    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and finds the maximum product that can be obtained by multiplying the numbers in an increasing subsequence of that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain an array where each element at index `i` represents the maximum product of an increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. For each element in the array, we will check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we will calculate the product and update our maximum product array accordingly. Finally, we will return the maximum value from this product array.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_product(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       if n is 0:\n           return 0\n       create a list dp of size n initialized to 0\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           dp[i] = arr[i]  // start with the element itself\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] * arr[i])  // update the product\n       return max(dp)  // return the maximum product found\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    n = len(arr)  # Get the length of the input array\n    if n == 0:  # If the array is empty, return 0\n        return 0\n    \n    dp = [0] * n  # Create a list to store maximum products\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i] = arr[i]  # Initialize the product with the element itself\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:  # Check if we can form an increasing subsequence\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] * arr[i])  # Update the product if it's greater\n    \n    return max(dp)  # Return the maximum product found\n```",
