    Title: Check if two segments intersect
    Part: 1/1
    # Check if two segments intersect

    You are given two segments $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$.
    You have to check if they intersect.
    Of course, you may find their intersection and check if it isn't empty, but this can't be done in integers for segments with integer coordinates.
    The approach described here can work in integers.

    ## Algorithm

    Firstly, consider the case when the segments are part of the same line.
    In this case it is sufficient to check if their projections on $Ox$ and $Oy$ intersect.
    In the other case $a$ and $b$ must not lie on the same side of line $(c, d)$, and $c$ and $d$ must not lie on the same side of line $(a, b)$.
    It can be checked with a couple of cross products.

    ## Implementation

    The given algorithm is implemented for integer points. Of course, it can be easily modified to work with doubles.

    ```{.cpp file=check-segments-inter}
    struct pt {
        long long x, y;
        pt() {}
        pt(long long _x, long long _y) : x(_x), y(_y) {}
        pt operator-(const pt& p) const { return pt(x - p.x, y - p.y); }
        long long cross(const pt& p) const { return x * p.y - y * p.x; }
        long long cross(const pt& a, const pt& b) const { return (a - *this).cross(b - *this); }
    };

    int sgn(const long long& x) { return x >= 0 ? x ? 1 : 0 : -1; }

    bool inter1(long long a, long long b, long long c, long long d) {
        if (a > b)
            swap(a, b);
        if (c > d)
            swap(c, d);
        return max(a, c) <= min(b, d);
    }

    bool check_inter(const pt& a, const pt& b, const pt& c, const pt& d) {
        if (c.cross(a, d) == 0 && c.cross(b, d) == 0)
            return inter1(a.x, b.x, c.x, d.x) && inter1(a.y, b.y, c.y, d.y);
        return sgn(a.cross(b, c)) != sgn(a.cross(b, d)) &&
               sgn(c.cross(d, a)) != sgn(c.cross(d, b));
    }
    ```

    Title: Finding intersection of two segments
    Part: 1/1
    # Finding intersection of two segments

    You are given two segments AB and CD, described as pairs of their endpoints. Each segment can be a single point if its endpoints are the same. 
    You have to find the intersection of these segments, which can be empty (if the segments don't intersect), a single point or a segment (if the given segments overlap).

    ## Solution

    We can find the intersection point of segments in the same way as [the intersection of lines](lines-intersection.md): 
    reconstruct line equations from the segments' endpoints and check whether they are parallel. 

    If the lines are not parallel, we need to find their point of intersection and check whether it belongs to both segments
    (to do this it's sufficient to verify that the intersection point belongs to each segment projected on X and Y axes). 
    In this case the answer will be either "no intersection" or the single point of lines' intersection.

    The case of parallel lines is slightly more complicated (the case of one or more segments being a single point also belongs here).
    In this case we need to check that both segments belong to the same line.
    If they don't, the answer is "no intersection".
    If they do, the answer is the intersection of the segments belonging to the same line, which is obtained by 
    ordering the endpoints of both segments in the increasing order of certain coordinate and taking the rightmost of left endpoints and the leftmost of right endpoints.

    If both segments are single points, these points have to be identical, and it makes sense to perform this check separately.

    In the beginning of the algorithm let's add a bounding box check - it is necessary for the case when the segments belong to the same line, 
    and (being a lightweight check) it allows the algorithm to work faster on average on random tests.


    ## Implementation

    Here is the implementation, including all helper functions for lines and segments processing.

    The main function `intersect` returns true if the segments have a non-empty intersection, 
    and stores endpoints of the intersection segment in arguments `left` and `right`. 
    If the answer is a single point, the values written to `left` and `right` will be the same.

    ```{.cpp file=segment_intersection}
    const double EPS = 1E-9;

    struct pt {
        double x, y;

    Title: Search for a pair of intersecting segments
    Part: 1/3
    # Search for a pair of intersecting segments

    Given $n$ line segments on the plane. It is required to check whether at least two of them intersect with each other.
    If the answer is yes, then print this pair of intersecting segments; it is enough to choose any of them among several answers.

    The naive solution algorithm is to iterate over all pairs of segments in $O(n^2)$ and check for each pair whether they intersect or not. This article describes an algorithm with the runtime time $O(n \log n)$, which is based on the **sweep line algorithm**.

    ## Algorithm

    Let's draw a vertical line $x = -\infty$ mentally and start moving this line to the right.
    In the course of its movement, this line will meet with segments, and at each time a segment intersect with our line it intersects in exactly one point (we will assume that there are no vertical segments).

    <center>![sweep line and line segment intersection](sweep_line_1.png)</center>

    Thus, for each segment, at some point in time, its point will appear on the sweep line, then with the movement of the line, this point will move, and finally, at some point, the segment will disappear from the line.

    We are interested in the **relative order of the segments** along the vertical.
    Namely, we will store a list of segments crossing the sweep line at a given time, where the segments will be sorted by their $y$-coordinate on the sweep line.

    <center>![relative order of the segments across sweep line](sweep_line_2.png)</center>

    This order is interesting because intersecting segments will have the same $y$-coordinate at least at one time:

    <center>![intersection point having same y-coordinate](sweep_line_3.png)</center>

    We formulate key statements:

      - To find an intersecting pair, it is sufficient to consider **only adjacent segments** at each fixed position of the sweep line.
      - It is enough to consider the sweep line not in all possible real positions $(-\infty \ldots +\infty)$, but **only in those positions when new segments appear or old ones disappear**. In other words, it is enough to limit yourself only to the positions equal to the abscissas of the end points of the segments.
      - When a new line segment appears, it is enough to **insert** it to the desired location in the list obtained for the previous sweep line. We should only check for the intersection of the **added segment with its immediate neighbors in the list above and below**.
      - If the segment disappears, it is enough to **remove** it from the current list. After that, it is necessary **check for the intersection of the upper and lower neighbors in the list**.
      - Other changes in the sequence of segments in the list, except for those described, do not exist. No other intersection checks are required.

    To understand the truth of these statements, the following remarks are sufficient:

      - Two disjoint segments never change their **relative order**.<br>
        In fact, if one segment was first higher than the other, and then became lower, then between these two moments there was an intersection of these two segments.
      - Two non-intersecting segments also cannot have the same $y$-coordinates.
      - From this it follows that at the moment of the segment appearance we can find the position for this segment in the queue, and we will not have to rearrange this segment in the queue any more: **its order relative to other segments in the queue will not change**.
      - Two intersecting segments at the moment of their intersection point will be neighbors of each other in the queue.
      - Therefore, for finding pairs of intersecting line segments is sufficient to check the intersection of all and only those pairs of segments that sometime during the movement of the sweep line at least once were neighbors to each other. <br>
        It is easy to notice that it is enough only to check the added segment with its upper and lower neighbors, as well as when removing the segment — its upper and lower neighbors (which after removal will become neighbors of each other).<br>
      - It should be noted that at a fixed position of the sweep line, we must **first add all the segments** that start at this x-coordinate, and only **then remove all the segments** that end here.<br>
        Thus, we do not miss the intersection of segments on the vertex: i.e. such cases when two segments have a common vertex.
      - Note that **vertical segments** do not actually affect the correctness of the algorithm.<br>
        These segments are distinguished by the fact that they appear and disappear at the same time. However, due to the previous comment, we know that all segments will be added to the queue first, and only then they will be deleted. Therefore, if the vertical segment intersects with some other segment opened at that moment (including the vertical one), it will be detected.<br>
        **In what place of the queue to place vertical segments?** After all, a vertical segment does not have one specific $y$-coordinate, it extends for an entire segment along the $y$-coordinate. However, it is easy to understand that any coordinate from this segment can be taken as a $y$-coordinate.

    Thus, the entire algorithm will perform no more than $2n$ tests on the intersection of a pair of segments, and will perform $O(n)$ operations with a queue of segments ($O(1)$ operations at the time of appearance and disappearance of each segment).

    The final **asymptotic behavior of the algorithm** is thus $O(n \log n)$.

    ## Implementation

    We present the full implementation of the described algorithm:

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/414 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a Python function that checks if there are any overlapping values between two sequences (lists). If there is at least one common value, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: To determine if there are overlapping values between two sequences, we can iterate through one sequence and check if any of its values exist in the other sequence. A more efficient approach would be to convert one of the sequences into a set (which allows for O(1) average time complexity for lookups) and then check each value in the other sequence against this set.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function overlapping(seq1, seq2):
       create a set from seq1
       for each value in seq2:
           if value exists in the set:
               return True
       return False
   ```

 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a Python function that checks if there are any overlapping values between two sequences (lists). If there is at least one common value, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: To determine if there are overlapping values between two sequences, we can iterate through one sequence and check if any of its values exist in the other sequence. A more efficient approach would be to convert one of the sequences into a set (which allows for O(1) average time complexity for lookups) and then check each value in the other sequence against this set.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function overlapping(seq1, seq2):
       create a set from seq1
       for each value in seq2:
           if value exists in the set:
               return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def overlapping(seq1, seq2):
    # Create a set from the first sequence for fast lookup
    set_seq1 = set(seq1)
    
    # Iterate through the second sequence
    for value in seq2:
        # Check if the current value exists in the set
        if value in set_seq1:
            return True  # Found an overlap
    
    return False  # No overlaps found
```
