    "raw_msg": "1. **Restatement of the Problem**: \n   We need to create a Python function that counts how many times the elements from a given list appear in a provided tuple. The function should return the total count of occurrences.\n\n2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of elements we want to count and for each element, check how many times it appears in the tuple. We can maintain a running total of these counts and return the total at the end.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_Occurrence(tuple, list):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each element in list:\n           count += count of element in tuple\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef count_Occurrence(tup, lst):\n    # Initialize the count of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # Count how many times the element appears in the tuple\n        count += tup.count(element)\n    # Return the total count\n    return count\n```",
