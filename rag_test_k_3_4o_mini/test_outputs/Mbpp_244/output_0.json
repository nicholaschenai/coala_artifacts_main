    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a number as input and returns the next perfect square that is greater than this number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the next perfect square greater than a given number, we can:\n   - Calculate the integer square root of the given number.\n   - Increment this integer by one to get the next integer.\n   - Square this incremented integer to get the next perfect square.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function next_Perfect_Square(n):\n       # Calculate the integer square root of n\n       root = integer square root of n\n       # Increment the root by 1\n       next_root = root + 1\n       # Return the square of the next_root\n       return next_root * next_root\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef next_Perfect_Square(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the integer square root of n\n    root = int(n**0.5)  # This gives us the largest integer whose square is <= n\n    # Increment the root by 1 to find the next integer\n    next_root = root + 1\n    # Return the square of the next_root which is the next perfect square\n    return next_root * next_root\n```",
