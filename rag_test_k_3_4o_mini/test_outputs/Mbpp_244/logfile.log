INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/244 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a number as input and returns the smallest perfect square that is greater than this number. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the next perfect square greater than a given number, we can:
   - Start by determining the integer square root of the given number. This will give us the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the number.
   - Increment this integer by one to find the next integer.
   - Square this incremented integer to get the next perfect square.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function next_Perfect_Square(n):
       integer_sqrt = floor(sqrt(n))  // Find the integer square root of n
       next_integer = integer_sqrt + 1  // Increment the integer square root
       next_perfect_square = next_integer * next_integer  // Square the next integer
       return next_perfect_square  // Return the next perfect square
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def next_Perfect_Square(n):
    # Find the integer square root of n
    integer_sqrt = int(n**0.5)
    # Increment the integer square root
    next_integer = integer_sqrt + 1
    # Square the next integer to get the next perfect square
    next_perfect_square = next_integer * next_integer
    # Return the next perfect square
    return next_perfect_square

    The following code implements the sieve of
    Eratosthenes.
    The code assumes that each element of
    \texttt{sieve} is initially zero.

    \begin{lstlisting}
    for (int x = 2; x <= n; x++) {
        if (sieve[x]) continue;
        for (int u = 2*x; u <= n; u += x) {
            sieve[u] = x;
        }
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The inner loop of the algorithm is executed
    $n/x$ times for each value of $x$.
    Thus, an upper bound for the running time
    of the algorithm is the harmonic sum
    \[\sum_{x=2}^n n/x = n/2 + n/3 + n/4 + \cdots + n/n = O(n \log n).\]

    \index{harmonic sum}

    In fact, the algorithm is more efficient,
    because the inner loop will be executed only if
    the number $x$ is prime.
    It can be shown that the running time of the
    algorithm is only $O(n \log \log n)$,
    a complexity very near to $O(n)$. 

    \subsubsection{Euclid's algorithm}

    \index{greatest common divisor}
    \index{least common multiple}
    \index{Euclid's algorithm}

    The \key{greatest common divisor} of
    numbers $a$ and $b$, $\gcd(a,b)$,
    is the greatest number that divides both $a$ and $b$,
    and the \key{least common multiple} of
    $a$ and $b$, $\textrm{lcm}(a,b)$,
    is the smallest number that is divisible by
    both $a$ and $b$.
    For example,
    $\gcd(24,36)=12$ and
    $\textrm{lcm}(24,36)=72$.

    The greatest common divisor and the least common multiple
    are connected as follows:
    \[\textrm{lcm}(a,b)=\frac{ab}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)}\]

    \key{Euclid's algorithm}\footnote{Euclid was a Greek mathematician who
    lived in about 300 BC. This is perhaps the first known algorithm in history.} provides an efficient way
    to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
    The algorithm is based on the following formula:
    \begin{equation*}
        \textrm{gcd}(a,b) = \begin{cases}
                   a        & b = 0\\
                   \textrm{gcd}(b,a \bmod b) & b \neq 0\\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(24,36) = \textrm{gcd}(36,24)
    = \textrm{gcd}(24,12) = \textrm{gcd}(12,0)=12.\]

    The algorithm can be implemented as follows:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    It can be shown that Euclid's algorithm works
    in $O(\log n)$ time, where $n=\min(a,b)$.
    The worst case for the algorithm is
    the case when $a$ and $b$ are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
    For example,
    \[\textrm{gcd}(13,8)=\textrm{gcd}(8,5)
    =\textrm{gcd}(5,3)=\textrm{gcd}(3,2)=\textrm{gcd}(2,1)=\textrm{gcd}(1,0)=1.\]

    \subsubsection{Euler's totient function}

    \index{coprime}
    \index{Euler's totient function}

    Numbers $a$ and $b$ are \key{coprime}
    if $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)=1$.
    \key{Euler's totient function} $\varphi(n)$
    %\footnote{Euler presented this function in 1763.}
    gives the number of coprime numbers to $n$
    between $1$ and $n$.
    For example, $\varphi(12)=4$,
    because 1, 5, 7 and 11
    are coprime to 12.

    The value of $\varphi(n)$ can be calculated
    from the prime factorization of $n$
    using the formula
    \[ \varphi(n) = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{\alpha_i-1}(p_i-1). \]
    For example, $\varphi(12)=2^1 \cdot (2-1) \cdot 3^0 \cdot (3-1)=4$.
    Note that $\varphi(n)=n-1$ if $n$ is prime.

        Using the same `step` function but different initial $x$, $y$ and $z$ it is possible to compute it for arbitrary $\frac{x+y \sqrt{n}}{z}$.

    !!! example "[Tavrida NU Akai Contest - Continued Fraction](https://timus.online/problem.aspx?space=1&num=1814)"
        You're given $x$ and $k$, $x$ is not a perfect square. Let $\sqrt x = [a_0; a_1, \dots]$, find $\frac{p_k}{q_k}=[a_0; a_1, \dots, a_k]$ for $0 \leq k \leq 10^9$.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        After computing the period of $\sqrt x$, it is possible to compute $a_k$ using binary exponentiation on the linear fractional transformation induced by the continued fraction representation. To find the resulting transformation, you compress the period of size $T$ into a single transformation and repeat it $\lfloor \frac{k-1}{T}\rfloor$ times, after which you manually combine it with the remaining transformations.
