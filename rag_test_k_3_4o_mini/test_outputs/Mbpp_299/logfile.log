INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/299 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a score. The function should calculate the total score for each unique name and return the name with the highest total score along with that score.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will create a dictionary to keep track of the total scores for each name.
   - We will iterate through the list of tuples, adding each score to the corresponding name in the dictionary.
   - After processing all tuples, we will find the name with the maximum score in the dictionary.
   - Finally, we will return that name along with its total score.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_aggregate(tuples):
       create an empty dictionary called score_dict
       for each tuple in tuples:
           extract name and score from the tuple
           if name is not in score_dict:
               add name to score_dict with initial score
           else:

    Section: Tasks and deadlines
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Tasks and deadlines}

    Let us now consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ tasks with durations and deadlines
    and our task is to choose an order to perform the tasks.
    For each task, we earn $d-x$ points
    where $d$ is the task's deadline
    and $x$ is the moment when we finish the task.
    What is the largest possible total score
    we can obtain?

    For example, suppose that the tasks are as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
    task & duration & deadline \\
    \hline
    $A$ & 4 & 2 \\
    $B$ & 3 & 5 \\
    $C$ & 2 & 7 \\
    $D$ & 4 & 5 \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    In this case, an optimal schedule for the tasks
    is as follows:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]
      \begin{scope}
        \draw (0, 0) rectangle (4, -1);
        \draw (4, 0) rectangle (10, -1);
        \draw (10, 0) rectangle (18, -1);
        \draw (18, 0) rectangle (26, -1);
        \node at (0.5,-0.5) {$C$};
        \node at (4.5,-0.5) {$B$};
        \node at (10.5,-0.5) {$A$};
        \node at (18.5,-0.5) {$D$};

        \draw (0,1.5) -- (26,1.5);
        \foreach \i in {0,2,...,26}
        {
            \draw (\i,1.25) -- (\i,1.75);
        }
        \footnotesize
        \node at (0,2.5) {0};
        \node at (10,2.5) {5};
        \node at (20,2.5) {10};

      \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    In this solution, $C$ yields 5 points,
    $B$ yields 0 points, $A$ yields $-7$ points
    and $D$ yields $-8$ points,
    so the total score is $-10$.

    Surprisingly, the optimal solution to the problem
    does not depend on the deadlines at all,
    but a correct greedy strategy is to simply
    perform the tasks \emph{sorted by their durations}
    in increasing order.
    The reason for this is that if we ever perform
    two tasks one after another such that the first task
    takes longer than the second task,
    we can obtain a better solution if we swap the tasks.
    For example, consider the following schedule:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]
      \begin{scope}
        \draw (0, 0) rectangle (8, -1);
        \draw (8, 0) rectangle (12, -1);
        \node at (0.5,-0.5) {$X$};
        \node at (8.5,-0.5) {$Y$};

    \draw [decoration={brace}, decorate, line width=0.3mm] (7.75,-1.5) -- (0.25,-1.5);
    \draw [decoration={brace}, decorate, line width=0.3mm] (11.75,-1.5) -- (8.25,-1.5);

    \footnotesize
    \node at (4,-2.5) {$a$};
    \node at (10,-2.5) {$b$};

      \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Here $a>b$, so we should swap the tasks:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.4]
      \begin{scope}
        \draw (0, 0) rectangle (4, -1);
        \draw (4, 0) rectangle (12, -1);
        \node at (0.5,-0.5) {$Y$};
        \node at (4.5,-0.5) {$X$};

    \draw [decoration={brace}, decorate, line width=0.3mm] (3.75,-1.5) -- (0.25,-1.5);
    \draw [decoration={brace}, decorate, line width=0.3mm] (11.75,-1.5) -- (4.25,-1.5);

    \footnotesize
    \node at (2,-2.5) {$b$};
    \node at (8,-2.5) {$a$};

      \end{scope}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    Now $X$ gives $b$ points less and $Y$ gives $a$ points more,
    so the total score increases by $a-b > 0$.
    In an optimal solution,
    for any two consecutive tasks,
    it must hold that the shorter task comes
    before the longer task.
    Thus, the tasks must be performed
    sorted by their durations.

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    ## Related tasks

    ### Finding the maximum/minimum subarray with constraints

    If the problem condition imposes additional restrictions on the required segment $[l, r]$ (for example, that the length $r-l+1$ of the segment must be within the specified limits), then the described algorithm is likely to be easily generalized to these cases — anyway, the problem will still be to find the minimum in the array $s[]$ with the specified additional restrictions.

    ### Two-dimensional case of the problem: search for maximum/minimum submatrix

    The problem described in this article is naturally generalized to large dimensions. For example, in a two-dimensional case, it turns into a search for such a submatrix $[l_1 \ldots r_1, l_2 \ldots r_2]$ of a given matrix, which has the maximum sum of numbers in it.

    Using the solution for the one-dimensional case, it is easy to obtain a solution in $O(n^3)$ for the two-dimensions case:
    we iterate over all possible values of $l_1$ and $r_1$, and calculate the sums from $l_1$ to $r_1$ in each row of the matrix. Now we have the one-dimensional problem of finding the indices $l_2$ and $r_2$ in this array, which can already be solved in linear time.

    **Faster** algorithms for solving this problem are known, but they are not much faster than $O(n^3)$, and are very complex (so complex that many of them are inferior to the trivial algorithm for all reasonable constraints by the hidden constant). Currently, the best known algorithm works in $O\left(n^3 \frac{ \log^3 \log n }{ \log^2 n} \right)$ time (T. Chan 2007 "More algorithms for all-pairs shortest paths in weighted graphs")

    This algorithm by Chan, as well as many other results in this area, actually describe **fast matrix multiplication** (where matrix multiplication means modified multiplication: minimum is used instead of addition, and addition is used instead of multiplication). The problem of finding the submatrix with the largest sum can be reduced to the problem of finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, and this problem, in turn, can be reduced to such a multiplication of matrices.

    ### Search for a subarray with a maximum/minimum average

    This problem lies in finding such a segment $a[l, r]$, such that the average value is maximal:

    $$ \max_{l \le r} \frac{ 1 }{ r-l+1 } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    Of course, if no other conditions are imposed on the required segment $[l, r]$, then the solution will always be a segment of length $1$ at the maximum element of the array. 
    The problem only makes sense, if there are additional restrictions (for example, the length of the desired segment is bounded below).

    In this case, we apply the **standard technique** when working with the problems of the average value: we will select the desired maximum average value by **binary search**.

    To do this, we need to learn how to solve the following subproblem: given the number $x$, and we need to check whether there is a subarray of array $a[]$ (of course, satisfying all additional constraints of the problem), where the average value is greater than $x$.

    To solve this subproblem, subtract $x$ from each element of array $a[]$. Then our subproblem actually turns into this one: whether or not there are positive sum subarrays in this array. And we already know how to solve this problem.

    Thus, we obtained the solution for the asymptotic $O(T(n) \log W)$, where $W$ is the required accuracy, $T(n)$ is the time of solving the subtask for an array of length $n$ (which may vary depending on the specific additional restrictions imposed).

    ### Solving the online problem

    The condition of the problem is as follows: given an array of $n$ numbers, and a number $L$. There are queries of the form $(l,r)$, and in response to each query, it is required to find a subarray of the segment $[l, r]$ of length not less than $L$ with the maximum possible arithmetic mean.

    The algorithm for solving this problem is quite complex. KADR (Yaroslav Tverdokhleb) described his algorithm on the [Russian forum](http://e-maxx.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?id=410).

    Section: Maximum subarray sum
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Maximum subarray sum}

    \index{maximum subarray sum}

    There are often several possible algorithms
    for solving a problem such that their
    time complexities are different.
    This section discusses a classic problem that
    has a straightforward $O(n^3)$ solution.
    However, by designing a better algorithm, it
    is possible to solve the problem in $O(n^2)$
    time and even in $O(n)$ time.

    Given an array of $n$ numbers,
    our task is to calculate the
    \key{maximum subarray sum}, i.e.,
    the largest possible sum of 
    a sequence of consecutive values
    in the array\footnote{J. Bentley's
    book \emph{Programming Pearls} \cite{ben86} made the problem popular.}.
    The problem is interesting when there may be
    negative values in the array.
    For example, in the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{samepage}
    the following subarray produces the maximum sum $10$:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (6,1);
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \end{samepage}

    We assume that an empty subarray is allowed,
    so the maximum subarray sum is always at least $0$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    A straightforward way to solve the problem
    is to go through all possible subarrays,
    calculate the sum of values in each subarray and maintain
    the maximum sum.
    The following code implements this algorithm:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int k = a; k <= b; k++) {
                sum += array[k];
            }
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The variables \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} fix the first and
    last index of the subarray,
    and the sum of values is calculated to the variable \texttt{sum}.
    The variable \texttt{best} contains the maximum sum found during the search.

    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^3)$,
    because it consists of three nested loops 
    that go through the input.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is easy to make Algorithm 1 more efficient
    by removing one loop from it.
    This is possible by calculating the sum at the same
    time when the right end of the subarray moves.
    The result is the following code:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            sum += array[b];
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this change, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Surprisingly, it is possible to solve the problem
    in $O(n)$ time\footnote{In \cite{ben86}, this linear-time algorithm
    is attributed to J. B. Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes
    called \index{Kadane's algorithm} \key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means
    that just one loop is enough.
    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,
    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.
    After this, the answer for the problem is the
    maximum of those sums.

    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray
    that ends at position $k$.
    There are two possibilities:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.
    \item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends
    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.
    \end{enumerate}

    In the latter case, since we want to
    find a subarray with maximum sum,
    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$
    should also have the maximum sum.
    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently
    by calculating the maximum subarray sum
    for each ending position from left to right.

    The following code implements the algorithm:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0, sum = 0;
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);
        best = max(best,sum);
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The algorithm only contains one loop
    that goes through the input,
    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.
    This is also the best possible time complexity,
    because any algorithm for the problem
    has to examine all array elements at least once.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    It is interesting to study how efficient 
    algorithms are in practice.
    The following table shows the running times
    of the above algorithms for different
    values of $n$ on a modern computer.

    In each test, the input was generated randomly.
    The time needed for reading the input was not
    measured.

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    array size $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^2$ & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^3$ & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^4$ & > $10.0$ s & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^5$ & > $10.0$ s & $5.3$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^6$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^7$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    The comparison shows that all algorithms
    are efficient when the input size is small,
    but larger inputs bring out remarkable
    differences in the running times of the algorithms.
    Algorithm 1 becomes slow
    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2
    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.
    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process
    even the largest inputs instantly.

   - After processing all tuples, we will find the name with the maximum score in the dictionary.
   - Finally, we will return that name along with its total score.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function max_aggregate(tuples):
       create an empty dictionary to store scores
       for each (name, score) in tuples:
           if name is not in dictionary:
               add name to dictionary with initial score of 0
           add score to the dictionary entry for name
       initialize max_name and max_score
       for each (name, total_score) in dictionary:
           if total_score > max_score:
               update max_name and max_score
       return (max_name, max_score)
   ```

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a score. The function should calculate the total score for each unique name and return the name with the highest total score along with that score.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will create a dictionary to keep track of the total scores for each name.
   - We will iterate through the list of tuples, adding the scores to the corresponding names in the dictionary.
   - After processing all tuples, we will find the name with the maximum score in the dictionary.
   - Finally, we will return that name along with its total score.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function max_aggregate(tuples):
