    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a name and a score. The function should calculate the total score for each unique name and return the name with the highest total score along with that score.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will create a dictionary to keep track of the total scores for each name.\n   - We will iterate through the list of tuples, adding the scores to the corresponding names in the dictionary.\n   - After processing all tuples, we will find the name with the maximum score in the dictionary.\n   - Finally, we will return that name along with its total score.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function max_aggregate(tuples):\n       create an empty dictionary to store scores\n       for each (name, score) in tuples:\n           if name is not in dictionary:\n               add name to dictionary with initial score of 0\n           add score to the dictionary entry for name\n       initialize max_name and max_score\n       for each (name, total_score) in dictionary:\n           if total_score > max_score:\n               update max_name and max_score\n       return (max_name, max_score)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef max_aggregate(tuples):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the total scores for each name\n    score_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for name, score in tuples:\n        # If the name is not in the dictionary, initialize it\n        if name not in score_dict:\n            score_dict[name] = 0\n        # Add the score to the corresponding name\n        score_dict[name] += score\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum score and corresponding name\n    max_name = \"\"\n    max_score = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the dictionary to find the name with the maximum score\n    for name, total_score in score_dict.items():\n        if total_score > max_score:\n            max_name = name\n            max_score = total_score\n    \n    # Return the name with the maximum score and the score itself\n    return (max_name, max_score)\n```",
