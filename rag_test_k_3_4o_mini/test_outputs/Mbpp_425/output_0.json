    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many sublists (or lists within a list) contain a specific element. For example, if we have a list of lists and we want to count how many of those lists contain the number 1, we should return that count.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each sublist in the main list and check if the specific element is present in that sublist. We will maintain a counter that increments each time we find the element in a sublist. Finally, we will return the counter.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_element_in_list(main_list, element):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each sublist in main_list:\n           if element is in sublist:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_element_in_list(main_list, element):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of sublists containing the element\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the main list\n    for sublist in main_list:\n        # Check if the element is present in the current sublist\n        if element in sublist:\n            # Increment the count if the element is found\n            count += 1\n            \n    # Return the total count of sublists containing the element\n    return count\n```",
