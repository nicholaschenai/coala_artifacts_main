INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/308 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers and finds the largest products that can be formed by multiplying one number from the first list with one number from the second list. The function should return the specified number of largest products in a list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each number in the first list and multiply it with each number in the second list to calculate all possible products.
   - We will store these products in a list.
   - After calculating all products, we will sort this list in descending order to find the largest products.
   - Finally, we will return the specified number of largest products from the sorted list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function large_product(list1, list2, n):
       create an empty list for products
       for each number in list1:
           for each number in list2:

               add the product to the products list
       sort the products list in descending order

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 3/5
    ```

    Asymptotics of the solution is $O (\sqrt{n})$.

    ### The number of integers in a given interval which are multiple of at least one of the given numbers

    Given $n$ numbers $a_i$ and number $r$. You want to count the number of integers in the interval $[1; r]$ that are multiple of at least one of the $a_i$.

    The solution algorithm is almost identical to the one for previous task â€” construct the formula of inclusion-exclusion on the numbers $a_i$, i.e. each term in this formula is the number of numbers divisible by a given subset of numbers $a_i$ (in other words, divisible by their [least common multiple](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md)).

    So we will now iterate over all $2^n$ subsets of integers $a_i$ with $O(n \log r)$ operations to find their least common multiple, adding or subtracting the number of multiples of it in the interval. Asymptotics is $O (2^n\cdot n\cdot \log r)$.

    ### The number of strings that satisfy a given pattern

    Consider $n$ patterns of strings of the same length, consisting only of letters ($a...z$) or question marks. You're also given a number $k$. A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. The task is to count the number of strings that match exactly $k$ of the patterns (first problem) and at least $k$ of the patterns (second problem).

    Notice first that we can easily count the number of strings that satisfy at once all of the specified patterns. To do this, simply "cross" patterns: iterate though the positions ("slots") and look at a position over all patterns. If all patterns have a question mark in this position, the character can be any letter from $a$ to $z$. Otherwise, the character of this position is uniquely defined by the patterns that do not contain a question mark.

    Learn now to solve the first version of the problem: when the string must satisfy exactly $k$ of the patterns.

    To solve it, iterate and fix a specific subset $X$ from the set of patterns consisting of $k$ patterns. Then we have to count the number of strings that satisfy this set of patterns, and only matches it, that is, they don't match any other pattern. We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a slightly different manner: we sum on all supersets $Y$ (subsets from the original set of strings that contain $X$), and either add to the current answer or subtract it from the number of strings:

    $$ ans(X) = \sum_{Y \supseteq X} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Where $f(Y)$ is the number of strings that match $Y$ (at least $Y$).

    (If you have a hard time figuring out this, you can try drawing Venn Diagrams.)

    If we sum up on all $ans(X)$, we will get the final answer:

    $$ ans = \sum_{X ~ : ~ |X| = k} ans(X) $$

    However, asymptotics of this solution is $O(3^k \cdot k)$. To improve it, notice that different $ans(X)$ computations very often share $Y$ sets.

    We will reverse the formula of inclusion-exclusion and sum in terms of $Y$ sets. Now it becomes clear that the same set $Y$ would be taken into account in the computation of $ans(X)$ of $\binom{|Y|}{k}$ sets with the same sign $(-1)^{|Y| - k}$.

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Now our solution has asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    We will now solve the second version of the problem: find the number of strings that match **at least** $k$ of the patterns.

    Of course, we can just use the solution to the first version of the problem and add the answers for sets with size greater than $k$. However, you may notice that in this problem, a set |Y| is considered in the formula for all sets with size $\ge k$ which are contained in $Y$. That said, we can write the part of the expression that is being multiplied by $f(Y)$ as:


    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-1} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+1} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-2} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+2} + \cdots + (-1)^{|Y|-|Y|} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{|Y|} $$

    Looking at Graham's (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. "Concrete mathematics" [1998] ), we see a well-known formula for [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \cdot \binom{n}{k} = (-1)^m \cdot \binom{n-1}{m} $$

    Applying it here, we find that the entire sum of binomial coefficients is minimized:

    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} $$

    Thus, for this task, we also obtained a solution with the asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$:

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    ### The number of ways of going from a cell to another

    There is a field $n \times m$, and $k$ of its cells are impassable walls. A robot is initially at the cell $(1,1)$ (bottom left). The robot can only move right or up, and eventually it needs to get into the cell $(n,m)$, avoiding all obstacles. You need to count the number of ways he can do it.

    Assume that the sizes $n$ and $m$ are very large (say, $10^9$), and the number $k$ is small (around $100$).

    For now, sort the obstacles by their coordinate $x$, and in case of equality â€” coordinate $y$.

    Also just learn how to solve a problem without obstacles: i.e. learn how to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another. In one axis, we need to go through $x$ cells, and on the other, $y$ cells. From simple combinatorics, we get a formula using [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$\binom{x+y}{x}$$

    Now to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another, avoiding all obstacles, you can use inclusion-exclusion to solve the inverse problem: count the number of ways to walk through the board stepping at a subset of obstacles (and subtract it from the total number of ways).

    When iterating over a subset of the obstacles that we'll step, to count the number of ways to do this simply multiply the number of all paths from starting cell to the first of the selected obstacles, a first obstacle to the second, and so on, and then add or subtract this number from the answer, in accordance with the standard formula of inclusion-exclusion.

    However, this will again be non-polynomial in complexity $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    Here goes a polynomial solution:

    We will use dynamic programming. For convenience, push (1,1) to the beginning and (n,m) at the end of the obstacles array. Let's compute the numbers $d[i]$ â€” the number of ways to get from the starting point ($0-th$) to $i-th$, without stepping on any other obstacle (except for $i$, of course). We will compute this number for all the obstacle cells, and also for the ending one.

    Let's forget for a second the obstacles and just count the number of paths from cell $0$ to $i$. We need to consider some "bad" paths, the ones that pass through the obstacles, and subtract them from the total number of ways of going from $0$ to $i$.

    When considering an obstacle $t$ between $0$ and $i$ ($0 < t < i$), on which we can step, we see that the number of paths from $0$ to $i$ that pass through $t$ which have $t$ as the **first obstacle between start and $i$**. We can compute that as: $d[t]$ multiplied by the number of arbitrary paths from $t$ to $i$. We can count the number of "bad" ways summing this for all $t$ between $0$ and $i$.

    We can compute $d[i]$ in $O(k)$ for $O(k)$ obstacles, so this solution has complexity $O(k^2)$.

    ### The number of coprime quadruples

    You're given $n$ numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You are required to count the number of ways to choose four numbers so that their combined greatest common divisor is equal to one.

    We will solve the inverse problem â€” compute the number of "bad" quadruples, i.e. quadruples in which all numbers are divisible by a number $d > 1$.

    We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle while summing over all possible groups of four numbers divisible by a divisor $d$.

    $$ans = \sum_{d \ge 2} (-1)^{deg(d)-1} \cdot f(d)$$

    Title: Finding Power of Factorial Divisor
    Part: 1/1
    # Finding Power of Factorial Divisor

    You are given two numbers $n$ and $k$. Find the largest power of $k$ $x$ such that $n!$ is divisible by $k^x$.

    ## Prime $k$ {data-toc-label="Prime k"}

    Let's first consider the case of prime $k$. The explicit expression for factorial

    $$n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \ldots (n-1) \cdot n$$

    Note that every $k$-th element of the product is divisible by $k$, i.e. adds $+1$ to the answer; the number of such elements is $\Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k}\Bigr\rfloor$.

    Next, every $k^2$-th element is divisible by $k^2$, i.e. adds another $+1$ to the answer (the first power of $k$ has already been counted in the previous paragraph). The number of such elements is $\Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k^2}\Bigr\rfloor$.

    And so on, for every $i$ each $k^i$-th element adds another $+1$ to the answer, and there are $\Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k^i}\Bigr\rfloor$ such elements.

    The final answer is

    $$\Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k}\Bigr\rfloor + \Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k^2}\Bigr\rfloor + \ldots + \Bigl\lfloor\dfrac{n}{k^i}\Bigr\rfloor + \ldots$$

    This result is also known as [Legendre's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_formula).
    The sum is of course finite, since only approximately the first $\log_k n$ elements are not zeros. Thus, the runtime of this algorithm is $O(\log_k n)$.

    ### Implementation

    ```cpp

    int fact_pow (int n, int k) {
    	int res = 0;
    	while (n) {
    		n /= k;
    		res += n;
    	}
    	return res;
    }

    ```

    ## Composite $k$ {data-toc-label="Composite k"}

    The same idea can't be applied directly. Instead we can factor $k$, representing it as $k = k_1^{p_1} \cdot \ldots \cdot k_m^{p_m}$. For each $k_i$, we find the number of times it is present in $n!$ using the algorithm described above - let's call this value $a_i$. The answer for composite $k$ will be

    $$\min_ {i=1 \ldots m} \dfrac{a_i}{p_i}$$
