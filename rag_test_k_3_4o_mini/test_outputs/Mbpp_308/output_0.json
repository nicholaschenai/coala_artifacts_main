    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers and finds the largest products that can be formed by multiplying one number from the first list with one number from the second list. The function should return a specified number of these largest products in descending order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - First, we will generate all possible products by multiplying each element from the first list with each element from the second list.\n   - We will then sort these products in descending order.\n   - Finally, we will return the top 'n' products as specified by the user.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function large_product(list1, list2, n):\n       Initialize an empty list for products\n       For each element in list1:\n           For each element in list2:\n               Calculate the product of the two elements\n               Append the product to the products list\n       Sort the products list in descending order\n       Return the first n elements of the sorted products list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef large_product(list1, list2, n):\n    # Step 1: Initialize an empty list to store products\n    products = []\n    \n    # Step 2: Generate all possible products\n    for num1 in list1:\n        for num2 in list2:\n            products.append(num1 * num2)\n    \n    # Step 3: Sort the products in descending order\n    products.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the top n products\n    return products[:n]\n```",
