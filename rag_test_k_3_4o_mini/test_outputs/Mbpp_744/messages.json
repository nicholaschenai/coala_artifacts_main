On this board there are $15$ playing tiles numbered from 1 to 15. One cell is left empty (denoted by 0). You need to get the board to the position presented below by repeatedly moving one of the tiles to the free space:\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\ 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\ 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 \\\\ 13 & 14 & 15 & 0 \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    The game \"15 Puzzle\u201d was created by Noyes Chapman in 1880.\n\n    ## Existence Of The Solution\n\n    Let's consider this problem: given a position on the board, determine whether a sequence of moves which leads to a solution exists.\n\n    Suppose we have some position on the board:\n\n    $$\\begin{matrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \\\\ a_5 & a_6 & a_7 & a_8 \\\\ a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\ a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} \\end{matrix}$$\n\n    where one of the elements equals zero and indicates an empty cell $a_z  = 0$\n\n    Let\u2019s consider the permutation:\n\n    $$a_1 a_2 ... a_{z-1} a_{z+1} ... a_{15} a_{16}$$\n\n    i.e. the permutation of numbers corresponding to the position on the board without a zero element\n\n    Let $N$ be the number of inversions in this permutation (i.e. the number of such elements $a_i$  and $a_j$  that $i < j$, but $a_i  > a_j$).\n\n    Suppose $K$ is an index of a row where the empty element is located (i.e. using our convention, $K = (z - 1) \\div \\ 4 + 1$).\n\n    Then, **the solution exists iff $N + K$ is even**.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    The algorithm above can be illustrated with the following program code:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int a[16];\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        cin >> a[i];\n\n    int inv = 0;\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        if (a[i])\n            for (int j=0; j<i; ++j)\n                if (a[j] > a[i])\n                    ++inv;\n    for (int i=0; i<16; ++i)\n        if (a[i] == 0)\n            inv += 1 + i / 4;\n\n    puts ((inv & 1) ? \"No Solution\" : \"Solution Exists\");\n    ```\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    In 1879 Johnson proved that if $N + K$ is odd, then the solution doesn\u2019t exist, and in the same year Story proved that all positions when $N + K$ is even have a solution.\n\n    However, all these proofs were quite complex.\n\n    In 1999 Archer proposed a much simpler proof (you can download his article [here](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15859-f01/www/notes/15-puzzle.pdf)).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: 2-SAT\n    Part: 1/2\n    # 2-SAT \n\n    SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) is the problem of assigning Boolean values to variables to satisfy a given Boolean formula.\n    The Boolean formula will usually be given in CNF (conjunctive normal form), which is a conjunction of multiple clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals (variables or negation of variables).\n    2-SAT (2-satisfiability) is a restriction of the SAT problem, in 2-SAT every clause has exactly two literals.\n    Here is an example of such a 2-SAT problem.\n    Find an assignment of $a, b, c$ such that the following formula is true:\n\n    $$(a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (a \\lor \\lnot c)$$\n\n    SAT is NP-complete, there is no known efficient solution known for it.\n    However 2SAT can be solved efficiently in $O(n + m)$ where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$ is the number of clauses.\n\n    ## Algorithm:\n\n    First we need to convert the problem to a different form, the so-called implicative normal form.\n    Note that the expression $a \\lor b$ is equivalent to $\\lnot a \\Rightarrow b \\land \\lnot b \\Rightarrow a$ (if one of the two variables is false, then the other one must be true).\n\n    We now construct a directed graph of these implications:\n    for each variable $x$ there will be two vertices $v_x$ and $v_{\\lnot x}$.\n    The edges will correspond to the implications.\n\n    Let's look at the example in 2-CNF form:\n\n    $$(a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor b) \\land (\\lnot a \\lor \\lnot b) \\land (a \\lor \\lnot c)$$\n\n    The oriented graph will contain the following vertices and edges:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{cccc}\n    \\lnot a \\Rightarrow \\lnot b & a \\Rightarrow b & a \\Rightarrow \\lnot b & \\lnot a \\Rightarrow \\lnot c\\\\\n    b \\Rightarrow a & \\lnot b \\Rightarrow \\lnot a & b \\Rightarrow \\lnot a & c \\Rightarrow a\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    You can see the implication graph in the following image:\n\n    <center>![\"Implication Graph of 2-SAT example\"](2SAT.png)</center>\n\n    It is worth paying attention to the property of the implication graph:\n    if there is an edge $a \\Rightarrow b$, then there also is an edge $\\lnot b \\Rightarrow \\lnot a$. \n\n    Also note, that if $x$ is reachable from $\\lnot x$, and $\\lnot x$ is reachable from $x$, then the problem has no solution.\n    Whatever value we choose for the variable $x$, it will always end in a contradiction - if $x$ will be assigned $\\text{true}$ then the implication tell us that $\\lnot x$ should also be $\\text{true}$ and visa versa.\n    It turns out, that this condition is not only necessary, but also sufficient.\n    We will prove this in a few paragraphs below.\n    First recall, if a vertex is reachable from a second one, and the second one is reachable from the first one, then these two vertices are in the same strongly connected component.\n    Therefore we can formulate the criterion for the existence of a solution as follows:\n\n    In order for this 2-SAT problem to have a solution, it is necessary and sufficient that for any variable $x$ the vertices $x$ and $\\lnot x$ are in different strongly connected components of the strong connection of the implication graph.\n\n    This criterion can be verified in $O(n + m)$ time by finding all strongly connected components.\n\n    The following image shows all strongly connected components for the example.\n    As we can check easily, neither of the four components contain a vertex $x$ and its negation $\\lnot x$, therefore the example has a solution.\n    We will learn in the next paragraphs how to compute a valid assignment, but just for demonstration purposes the solution $a = \\text{false}$, $b = \\text{false}$, $c = \\text{false}$ is given.\n\n    <center>![\"Strongly Connected Components of the 2-SAT example\"](2SAT_SCC.png)</center>\n\n    Now we construct the algorithm for finding the solution of the 2-SAT problem on the assumption that the solution exists.\n\n    Note that, in spite of the fact that the solution exists, it can happen that $\\lnot x$ is reachable from $x$ in the implication graph, or that (but not simultaneously) $x$ is reachable from $\\lnot x$.\n    In that case the choice of either $\\text{true}$ or $\\text{false}$ for $x$ will lead to a contradiction, while the choice of the other one will not.\n    Let's learn how to choose a value, such that we don't generate a contradiction.\n\n    Let us sort the strongly connected components in topological order (i.e. $\\text{comp}[v] \\le \\text{comp}[u]$ if there is a path from $v$ to $u$) and let $\\text{comp}[v]$ denote the index of strongly connected component to which the vertex $v$ belongs.\n    Then, if $\\text{comp}[x] < \\text{comp}[\\lnot x]$ we assign $x$ with $\\text{false}$ and $\\text{true}$ otherwise.\n\n    Let us prove that with this assignment of the variables we do not arrive at a contradiction.\n    Suppose $x$ is assigned with $\\text{true}$.\n    The other case can be proven in a similar way.\n\n    First we prove that the vertex $x$ cannot reach the vertex $\\lnot x$.\n    Because we assigned $\\text{true}$ it has to hold that the index of strongly connected component of $x$ is greater than the index of the component of $\\lnot x$.\n    This means that $\\lnot x$ is located on the left of the component containing $x$, and the later vertex cannot reach the first.\n\n    Secondly we prove that there doesn't exist a variable $y$, such that the vertices $y$ and $\\lnot y$ are both reachable from $x$ in the implication graph.\n    This would cause a contradiction, because $x = \\text{true}$ implies that $y = \\text{true}$ and $\\lnot y = \\text{true}$.\n    Let us prove this by contradiction.\n    Suppose that $y$ and $\\lnot y$ are both reachable from $x$, then by the property of the implication graph $\\lnot x$ is reachable from both $y$ and $\\lnot y$.\n    By transitivity this results that $\\lnot x$ is reachable by $x$, which contradicts the assumption.\n\n    So we have constructed an algorithm that finds the required values of variables under the assumption that for any variable $x$ the vertices $x$ and $\\lnot x$ are in different strongly connected components.\n    Above showed the correctness of this algorithm.\n    Consequently we simultaneously proved the above criterion for the existence of a solution.\n\n    ## Implementation:\n\n    Now we can implement the entire algorithm.\n    First we construct the graph of implications and find all strongly connected components.\n    This can be accomplished with Kosaraju's algorithm in $O(n + m)$ time.\n    In the second traversal of the graph Kosaraju's algorithm visits the strongly connected components in topological order, therefore it is easy to compute $\\text{comp}[v]$ for each vertex $v$.\n\n    Afterwards we can choose the assignment of $x$ by comparing $\\text{comp}[x]$ and $\\text{comp}[\\lnot x]$. \n    If $\\text{comp}[x] = \\text{comp}[\\lnot x]$ we return $\\text{false}$ to indicate that there doesn't exist a valid assignment that satisfies the 2-SAT problem.\n\n    Below is the implementation of the solution of the 2-SAT problem for the already constructed graph of implication $adj$ and the transpose graph $adj^{\\intercal}$ (in which the direction of each edge is reversed).\n    In the graph the vertices with indices $2k$ and $2k+1$ are the two vertices corresponding to variable $k$ with $2k+1$ corresponding to the negated variable.\n\n    ```{.cpp file=2sat}\n    int n;\n    vector<vector<int>> adj, adj_t;\n    vector<bool> used;\n    vector<int> order, comp;\n    vector<bool> assignment;\n\n    void dfs1(int v) {\n

Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Primality tests\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Primality tests\n\n    This article describes multiple algorithms to determine if a number is prime or not.\n\n    ## Trial division\n\n    By definition a prime number doesn't have any divisors other than $1$ and itself.\n    A composite number has at least one additional divisor, let's call it $d$.\n    Naturally $\\frac{n}{d}$ is also a divisor of $n$.\n    It's easy to see, that either $d \\le \\sqrt{n}$ or $\\frac{n}{d} \\le \\sqrt{n}$, therefore one of the divisors $d$ and $\\frac{n}{d}$ is $\\le \\sqrt{n}$.\n    We can use this information to check for primality.\n\n    We try to find a non-trivial divisor, by checking if any of the numbers between $2$ and $\\sqrt{n}$ is a divisor of $n$.\n    If it is a divisor, than $n$ is definitely not prime, otherwise it is.\n\n    ```cpp\n    bool isPrime(int x) {\n        for (int d = 2; d * d <= x; d++) {\n            if (x % d == 0)\n                return false;\n        }\n        return x >= 2;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This is the simplest form of a prime check.\n    You can optimize this function quite a bit, for instance by only checking all odd numbers in the loop, since the only even prime number is 2.\n    Multiple such optimizations are described in the article about [integer factorization](factorization.md).\n\n    ## Fermat primality test\n\n    This is a probabilistic test.\n\n    Fermat's little theorem (see also [Euler's totient function](phi-function.md)) states, that for a prime number $p$ and a coprime integer $a$ the following equation holds:\n\n    $$a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\bmod p$$\n\n    In general this theorem doesn't hold for composite numbers.\n\n    This can be used to create a primality test.\n    We pick an integer $2 \\le a \\le p - 2$, and check if the equation holds or not.\n    If it doesn't hold, e.g. $a^{p-1} \\not\\equiv 1 \\bmod p$, we know that $p$ cannot be a prime number.\n    In this case we call the base $a$ a *Fermat witness* for the compositeness of $p$.\n\n    However it is also possible, that the equation holds for a composite number.\n    So if the equation holds, we don't have a proof for primality.\n    We only can say that $p$ is *probably prime*.\n    If it turns out that the number is actually composite, we call the base $a$ a *Fermat liar*.\n\n    By running the test for all possible bases $a$, we can actually prove that a number is prime.\n    However this is not done in practice, since this is a lot more effort that just doing *trial division*.\n    Instead the test will be repeated multiple times with random choices for $a$.\n    If we find no witness for the compositeness, it is very likely that the number is in fact prime.\n\n    ```cpp\n    bool probablyPrimeFermat(int n, int iter=5) {\n        if (n < 4)\n            return n == 2 || n == 3;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {\n            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);\n            if (binpower(a, n - 1, n) != 1)\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    We use [Binary Exponentiation](binary-exp.md) to efficiently compute the power $a^{p-1}$.\n\n    There is one bad news though:\n    there exist some composite numbers where $a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\bmod n$ holds for all $a$ coprime to $n$, for instance for the number $561 = 3 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 17$.\n    Such numbers are called *Carmichael numbers*.\n    The Fermat primality test can identify these numbers only, if we have immense luck and choose a base $a$ with $\\gcd(a, n) \\ne 1$.\n\n    The Fermat test is still be used in practice, as it is very fast and Carmichael numbers are very rare.\n    E.g. there only exist 646 such numbers below $10^9$.\n\n    ## Miller-Rabin primality test\n\n    The Miller-Rabin test extends the ideas from the Fermat test.\n\n    For an odd number $n$, $n-1$ is even and we can factor out all powers of 2.\n    We can write:\n\n    $$n - 1 = 2^s \\cdot d,~\\text{with}~d~\\text{odd}.$$\n\n    This allows us to factorize the equation of Fermat's little theorem:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{rl}\n    a^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\bmod n &\\Longleftrightarrow a^{2^s d} - 1 \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    &\\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-1} d} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    &\\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    &\\quad\\vdots \\\\\\\\\n    &\\Longleftrightarrow (a^{2^{s-1} d} + 1) (a^{2^{s-2} d} + 1) \\cdots (a^{d} + 1) (a^{d} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod n \\\\\\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    If $n$ is prime, then $n$ has to divide one of these factors.\n    And in the Miller-Rabin primality test we check exactly that statement, which is a more stricter version of the statement of the Fermat test.\n    For a base $2 \\le a \\le n-2$ we check if either\n\n    $$a^d \\equiv 1 \\bmod n$$\n\n    holds or\n\n    $$a^{2^r d} \\equiv -1 \\bmod n$$\n\n    holds for some $0 \\le r \\le s - 1$.\n\n    If we found a base $a$ which doesn't satisfy any of the above equalities, than we found a *witness* for the compositeness of $n$.\n    In this case we have proven that $n$ is not a prime number.\n\n    Similar to the Fermat test, it is also possible that the set of equations is satisfied for a composite number.\n    In that case the base $a$ is called a *strong liar*.\n    If a base $a$ satisfies the equations (one of them), $n$ is only *strong probable prime*.\n    However, there are no numbers like the Carmichael numbers, where all non-trivial bases lie.\n    In fact it is possible to show, that at most $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the bases can be strong liars.\n    If $n$ is composite, we have a probability of $\\ge 75\\%$ that a random base will tell us that it is composite.\n    By doing multiple iterations, choosing different random bases, we can tell with very high probability if the number is truly prime or if it is composite.\n\n    Here is an implementation for 64 bit integer.\n\n    ```cpp\n    using u64 = uint64_t;\n    using u128 = __uint128_t;\n\n    u64 binpower(u64 base, u64 e, u64 mod) {\n        u64 result = 1;\n        base %= mod;\n        while (e) {\n            if (e & 1)\n                result = (u128)result * base % mod;\n            base = (u128)base * base % mod;\n            e >>= 1;\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    bool check_composite(u64 n, u64 a, u64 d, int s) {\n        u64 x = binpower(a, d, n);\n        if (x == 1 || x == n - 1)\n            return false;\n        for (int r = 1; r < s; r++) {\n            x = (u128)x * x % n;\n            if (x == n - 1)\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    };\n\n    bool MillerRabin(u64 n, int iter=5) { // returns true if n is probably prime, else returns false.\n        if (n < 4)\n            return n == 2 || n == 3;\n\n        int s = 0;\n        u64 d = n - 1;\n        while ((d & 1) == 0) {\n            d >>= 1;\n            s++;\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < iter; i++) {\n            int a = 2 + rand() % (n - 3);\n            if (check_composite(n, a, d, s))\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Before the Miller-Rabin test you can test additionally if one of the first few prime numbers is a divisor.\n    This can speed up the test by a lot, since most composite numbers have very small prime divisors.\n    E.g. $88\\%$ of all numbers have a prime factors smaller than $100$.\n\n    ### Deterministic version\n\n    Miller showed that it is possible to make the algorithm deterministic by only checking all bases $\\le O((\\ln n)^2)$.\n    Bach later gave a concrete bound, it is only necessary to test all bases $a \\le 2 \\ln(n)^2$.\n\n    This is still a pretty large number of bases.\n    So people have invested quite a lot of computation power into finding lower bounds.\n    It turns out, for testing a 32 bit integer it is only necessary to check the first 4 prime bases: 2, 3, 5 and 7.\n    The smallest composite number that fails this test is $3,215,031,751 = 151 \\cdot 751 \\cdot 28351$.\n    And for testing 64 bit integer it is enough to check the first 12 prime bases: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and 37.\n\n    This results in the following deterministic implementation:\n\n    ```cpp\n    bool MillerRabin(u64 n) { // returns true if n is prime, else returns false.\n        if (n < 2)\n            return false;\n\n        int r = 0;\n        u64 d = n - 1;\n        while ((d & 1) == 0) {\n            d >>= 1;\n            r++;\n        }\n\n        for (int a : {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37}) {\n            if (n == a)\n                return true;\n            if (check_composite(n, a, d, r))\n                return false;\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

If there is at least one `None` value in the tuple, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element of the tuple and check if any of the elements is `None`. If we find a `None` value, we can immediately return `True`. If we finish checking all elements without finding a `None`, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function check_none(input_tuple):\n       for each element in input_tuple:\n           if element is None:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\ndef check_none(input_tuple: tuple) -> bool:\n    # Iterate through each element in the tuple\n    for element in input_tuple:\n        # Check if the current element is None\n        if element is None:\n            return True  # Return True if None is found\n    return False  # Return False if no None is found\n```"
