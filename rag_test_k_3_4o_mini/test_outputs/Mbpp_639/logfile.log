INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/639 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of names and calculates the total length of the names that start with an uppercase letter. Any names that start with a lowercase letter should be ignored in this calculation.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each name in the provided list.
   - For each name, we will check if the first character is uppercase.
   - If it is uppercase, we will add the length of that name to a running total.
   - Finally, we will return the total length of all the names that started with an uppercase letter.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sample_nam(names):
       initialize total_length to 0
       for each name in names:
           if the first character of name is uppercase:
               add the length of name to total_length
       return total_length
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
def sample_nam(names):
    # Initialize a variable to hold the total length of valid names
    total_length = 0
    
    # Iterate through each name in the provided list
    for name in names:
        # Check if the first character of the name is uppercase
        if name and name[0].isupper():

    # Return the total length of names that start with an uppercase letter
    return total_length

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 3/5
    ```

    Asymptotics of the solution is $O (\sqrt{n})$.

    ### The number of integers in a given interval which are multiple of at least one of the given numbers

    Given $n$ numbers $a_i$ and number $r$. You want to count the number of integers in the interval $[1; r]$ that are multiple of at least one of the $a_i$.

    The solution algorithm is almost identical to the one for previous task â€” construct the formula of inclusion-exclusion on the numbers $a_i$, i.e. each term in this formula is the number of numbers divisible by a given subset of numbers $a_i$ (in other words, divisible by their [least common multiple](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md)).

    So we will now iterate over all $2^n$ subsets of integers $a_i$ with $O(n \log r)$ operations to find their least common multiple, adding or subtracting the number of multiples of it in the interval. Asymptotics is $O (2^n\cdot n\cdot \log r)$.

    ### The number of strings that satisfy a given pattern

    Consider $n$ patterns of strings of the same length, consisting only of letters ($a...z$) or question marks. You're also given a number $k$. A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. The task is to count the number of strings that match exactly $k$ of the patterns (first problem) and at least $k$ of the patterns (second problem).

    Notice first that we can easily count the number of strings that satisfy at once all of the specified patterns. To do this, simply "cross" patterns: iterate though the positions ("slots") and look at a position over all patterns. If all patterns have a question mark in this position, the character can be any letter from $a$ to $z$. Otherwise, the character of this position is uniquely defined by the patterns that do not contain a question mark.

    Learn now to solve the first version of the problem: when the string must satisfy exactly $k$ of the patterns.

    To solve it, iterate and fix a specific subset $X$ from the set of patterns consisting of $k$ patterns. Then we have to count the number of strings that satisfy this set of patterns, and only matches it, that is, they don't match any other pattern. We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a slightly different manner: we sum on all supersets $Y$ (subsets from the original set of strings that contain $X$), and either add to the current answer or subtract it from the number of strings:

    $$ ans(X) = \sum_{Y \supseteq X} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Where $f(Y)$ is the number of strings that match $Y$ (at least $Y$).

    (If you have a hard time figuring out this, you can try drawing Venn Diagrams.)

    If we sum up on all $ans(X)$, we will get the final answer:

    $$ ans = \sum_{X ~ : ~ |X| = k} ans(X) $$

    However, asymptotics of this solution is $O(3^k \cdot k)$. To improve it, notice that different $ans(X)$ computations very often share $Y$ sets.

    We will reverse the formula of inclusion-exclusion and sum in terms of $Y$ sets. Now it becomes clear that the same set $Y$ would be taken into account in the computation of $ans(X)$ of $\binom{|Y|}{k}$ sets with the same sign $(-1)^{|Y| - k}$.

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Now our solution has asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    We will now solve the second version of the problem: find the number of strings that match **at least** $k$ of the patterns.

    Of course, we can just use the solution to the first version of the problem and add the answers for sets with size greater than $k$. However, you may notice that in this problem, a set |Y| is considered in the formula for all sets with size $\ge k$ which are contained in $Y$. That said, we can write the part of the expression that is being multiplied by $f(Y)$ as:


    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-1} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+1} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-2} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+2} + \cdots + (-1)^{|Y|-|Y|} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{|Y|} $$

    Looking at Graham's (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. "Concrete mathematics" [1998] ), we see a well-known formula for [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \cdot \binom{n}{k} = (-1)^m \cdot \binom{n-1}{m} $$

    Applying it here, we find that the entire sum of binomial coefficients is minimized:

    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} $$

    Thus, for this task, we also obtained a solution with the asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$:

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    ### The number of ways of going from a cell to another

    There is a field $n \times m$, and $k$ of its cells are impassable walls. A robot is initially at the cell $(1,1)$ (bottom left). The robot can only move right or up, and eventually it needs to get into the cell $(n,m)$, avoiding all obstacles. You need to count the number of ways he can do it.

    Assume that the sizes $n$ and $m$ are very large (say, $10^9$), and the number $k$ is small (around $100$).

    For now, sort the obstacles by their coordinate $x$, and in case of equality â€” coordinate $y$.

    Also just learn how to solve a problem without obstacles: i.e. learn how to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another. In one axis, we need to go through $x$ cells, and on the other, $y$ cells. From simple combinatorics, we get a formula using [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$\binom{x+y}{x}$$

    Now to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another, avoiding all obstacles, you can use inclusion-exclusion to solve the inverse problem: count the number of ways to walk through the board stepping at a subset of obstacles (and subtract it from the total number of ways).

    When iterating over a subset of the obstacles that we'll step, to count the number of ways to do this simply multiply the number of all paths from starting cell to the first of the selected obstacles, a first obstacle to the second, and so on, and then add or subtract this number from the answer, in accordance with the standard formula of inclusion-exclusion.

    However, this will again be non-polynomial in complexity $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    Here goes a polynomial solution:

    We will use dynamic programming. For convenience, push (1,1) to the beginning and (n,m) at the end of the obstacles array. Let's compute the numbers $d[i]$ â€” the number of ways to get from the starting point ($0-th$) to $i-th$, without stepping on any other obstacle (except for $i$, of course). We will compute this number for all the obstacle cells, and also for the ending one.

    Let's forget for a second the obstacles and just count the number of paths from cell $0$ to $i$. We need to consider some "bad" paths, the ones that pass through the obstacles, and subtract them from the total number of ways of going from $0$ to $i$.

    When considering an obstacle $t$ between $0$ and $i$ ($0 < t < i$), on which we can step, we see that the number of paths from $0$ to $i$ that pass through $t$ which have $t$ as the **first obstacle between start and $i$**. We can compute that as: $d[t]$ multiplied by the number of arbitrary paths from $t$ to $i$. We can count the number of "bad" ways summing this for all $t$ between $0$ and $i$.

    We can compute $d[i]$ in $O(k)$ for $O(k)$ obstacles, so this solution has complexity $O(k^2)$.

    ### The number of coprime quadruples

    You're given $n$ numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You are required to count the number of ways to choose four numbers so that their combined greatest common divisor is equal to one.

    We will solve the inverse problem â€” compute the number of "bad" quadruples, i.e. quadruples in which all numbers are divisible by a number $d > 1$.

    We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle while summing over all possible groups of four numbers divisible by a divisor $d$.

    $$ans = \sum_{d \ge 2} (-1)^{deg(d)-1} \cdot f(d)$$

    Title: Prefix function. Knuthâ€“Morrisâ€“Pratt algorithm
    Part: 3/4
    ```

    Here for each value of the prefix function we first count how many times it occurs in the array $\pi$, and then compute the final answers:
    if we know that the length prefix $i$ appears exactly $\text{ans}[i]$ times, then this number must be added to the number of occurrences of its longest suffix that is also a prefix.
    At the end we need to add $1$ to each result, since we also need to count the original prefixes also.

    Now let us consider the second problem.
    We apply the trick from Knuth-Morris-Pratt:
    we create the string $s + \# + t$ and compute its prefix function.
    The only differences to the first task is, that we are only interested in the prefix values that relate to the string $t$, i.e. $\pi[i]$ for $i \ge n + 1$.
    With those values we can perform the exact same computations as in the first task.

    ### The number of different substring in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to compute the number of different substrings appearing in it.

    We will solve this problem iteratively.
    Namely we will learn, knowing the current number of different substrings, how to recompute this count by adding a character to the end.

    So let $k$ be the current number of different substrings in $s$, and we add the character $c$ to the end of $s$.
    Obviously some new substrings ending in $c$ will appear.
    We want to count these new substrings that didn't appear before.

    We take the string $t = s + c$ and reverse it.
    Now the task is transformed into computing how many prefixes there are that don't appear anywhere else.
    If we compute the maximal value of the prefix function $\pi_{\text{max}}$ of the reversed string $t$, then the longest prefix that appears in $s$ is $\pi_{\text{max}}$ long.
    Clearly also all prefixes of smaller length appear in it.

    Therefore the number of new substrings appearing when we add a new character $c$ is $|s| + 1 - \pi_{\text{max}}$.

    So for each character appended we can compute the number of new substrings in $O(n)$ times, which gives a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ in total.

    It is worth noting, that we can also compute the number of different substrings by appending the characters at the beginning, or by deleting characters from the beginning or the end.

    ### Compressing a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$.
    We want to find the shortest "compressed" representation of the string, i.e. we want to find a string $t$ of smallest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    It is clear, that we only need to find the length of $t$. Knowing the length, the answer to the problem will be the prefix of $s$ with this length.

    Let us compute the prefix function for $s$.
    Using the last value of it we define the value $k = n - \pi[n - 1]$.
    We will show, that if $k$ divides $n$, then $k$ will be the answer, otherwise there is no effective compression and the answer is $n$.

    Let $n$ be divisible by $k$.
    Then the string can be partitioned into blocks of the length $k$.
    By definition of the prefix function, the prefix of length $n - k$ will be equal with its suffix.
    But this means that the last block is equal to the block before.
    And the block before has to be equal to the block before it.
    And so on.
    As a result, it turns out that all blocks are equal, therefore we can compress the string $s$ to length $k$.

    Of course we still need to show that this is actually the optimum.
    Indeed, if there was a smaller compression than $k$, than the prefix function at the end would be greater than $n - k$.
    Therefore $k$ is really the answer.

    Now let us assume that $n$ is not divisible by $k$.
    We show that this implies that the length of the answer is $n$.
    We prove it by contradiction.
    Assuming there exists an answer, and the compression has length $p$ ($p$ divides $n$).
    Then the last value of the prefix function has to be greater than $n - p$, i.e. the suffix will partially cover the first block.
    Now consider the second block of the string.
    Since the prefix is equal with the suffix, and both the prefix and the suffix cover this block and their displacement relative to each other $k$ does not divide the block length $p$ (otherwise $k$ divides $n$), then all the characters of the block have to be identical.
    But then the string consists of only one character repeated over and over, hence we can compress it to a string of size $1$, which gives $k = 1$, and $k$ divides $n$.
    Contradiction.

    $$\overbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ s_3}^p ~ \overbrace{s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6 ~ s_7}^p$$

    $$s_0 ~ s_1 ~ s_2 ~ \underbrace{\overbrace{s_3 ~ s_4 ~ s_5 ~ s_6}^p ~ s_7}_{\pi[7] = 5}$$

    $$s_4 = s_3, ~ s_5 = s_4, ~ s_6 = s_5, ~ s_7 = s_6 ~ \Rightarrow ~ s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = s_3$$

    ### Building an automaton according to the prefix function

    Let's return to the concatenation to the two strings through a separator, i.e. for the strings $s$ and $t$ we compute the prefix function for the string $s + \# + t$.
    Obviously, since $\#$ is a separator, the value of the prefix function will never exceed $|s|$.
    It follows, that it is sufficient to only store the string $s + \#$ and the values of the prefix function for it, and we can compute the prefix function for all subsequent character on the fly:

    $$\underbrace{s_0 ~ s_1 ~ \dots ~ s_{n-1} ~ \#}_{\text{need to store}} ~ \underbrace{t_0 ~ t_1 ~ \dots ~ t_{m-1}}_{\text{do not need to store}}$$

    Indeed, in such a situation, knowing the next character $c \in t$ and the value of the prefix function of the previous position is enough information to compute the next value of the prefix function, without using any previous characters of the string $t$ and the value of the prefix function in them.

    In other words, we can construct an **automaton** (a finite state machine): the state in it is the current value of the prefix function, and the transition from one state to another will be performed via the next character.

    Thus, even without having the string $t$, we can construct such a transition table $(\text{old}_\pi, c) \rightarrow \text{new}_\pi$ using the same algorithm as for calculating the transition table:

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_slow}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                int j = i;
                while (j > 0 && 'a' + c != s[j])
                    j = pi[j-1];
                if ('a' + c == s[j])
                    j++;
                aut[i][c] = j;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    However in this form the algorithm runs in $O(n^2 26)$ time for the lowercase letters of the alphabet.
    Note that we can apply dynamic programming and use the already calculated parts of the table.
    Whenever we go from the value $j$ to the value $\pi[j-1]$, we actually mean that the transition $(j, c)$ leads to the same state as the transition as $(\pi[j-1], c)$, and this answer is already accurately computed.

    ```{.cpp file=prefix_automaton_fast}
    void compute_automaton(string s, vector<vector<int>>& aut) {
        s += '#';
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> pi = prefix_function(s);
        aut.assign(n, vector<int>(26));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                if (i > 0 && 'a' + c != s[i])
                    aut[i][c] = aut[pi[i-1]][c];
                else
                    aut[i][c] = i + ('a' + c == s[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 2/5
    <div id="the-number-of-integer-solutions-to-the-equation"></div>
    ### Number of upper-bound integer sums {: #number-of-upper-bound-integer-sums }

    Consider the following equation:

    $$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 = 20$$

    where $0 \le x_i \le 8 ~ (i = 1,2,\ldots 6)$.

    Task: count the number of solutions to the equation.

    Forget the restriction on $x_i$ for a moment and just count the number of nonnegative solutions to this equation. This is easily done using [Stars and Bars](stars_and_bars.md):
    we want to break a sequence of $20$ units into $6$ groups, which is the same as arranging $5$ _bars_ and $20$ _stars_:

    $$N_0 = \binom{25}{5}$$

    We will now calculate the number of "bad" solutions with the inclusion-exclusion principle. The "bad" solutions will be those in which one or more $x_i$ are greater than $9$.

    Denote by $A_k ~ (k = 1,2\ldots 6)$ the set of solutions where $x_k \ge 9$, and all other $x_i \ge 0 ~ (i \ne k)$ (they may be $\ge 9$ or not). To calculate the size of $A_k$, note that we have essentially the same combinatorial problem that was solved in the two paragraphs above, but now $9$ of the units are excluded from the slots and definitely belong to the first group. Thus:

    $$ | A_k | = \binom{16}{5} $$

    Similarly, the size of the intersection between two sets $A_k$ and $A_p$ (for $k \ne p$) is equal to:

    $$ \left| A_k \cap A_p \right| = \binom{7}{5}$$

    The size of each intersection of three sets is zero, since $20$ units will not be enough for three or more variables greater than or equal to $9$.

    Combining all this into the formula of inclusions-exceptions and given that we solved the inverse problem, we finally get the answer:

    $$\binom{25}{5} - \left(\binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{16}{5} - \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{7}{5}\right) $$

    ### The number of relative primes in a given interval

    Task: given two numbers $n$ and $r$, count the number of integers in the interval $[1;r]$ that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is $1$).

    Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with $n$.

    We will denote the prime factors of $n$ as $p_i (i = 1\cdots k)$.

    How many numbers in the interval $[1;r]$ are divisible by $p_i$? The answer to this question is:

    $$ \left\lfloor \frac{ r }{ p_i } \right\rfloor $$

    However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple $p_i$ as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

    We will iterate over all $2^k$ subsets of $p_i$s, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.

    Here is a C++ implementation:

    ```cpp
    int solve (int n, int r) {
    	vector<int> p;
    	for (int i=2; i*i<=n; ++i)
    		if (n % i == 0) {
    			p.push_back (i);
    			while (n % i == 0)
    				n /= i;
    		}
    	if (n > 1)
    		p.push_back (n);

    	int sum = 0;
    	for (int msk=1; msk<(1<<p.size()); ++msk) {
    		int mult = 1,
    			bits = 0;
    		for (int i=0; i<(int)p.size(); ++i)
    			if (msk & (1<<i)) {
    				++bits;
    				mult *= p[i];
    			}

    		int cur = r / mult;
    		if (bits % 2 == 1)
    			sum += cur;
    		else
    			sum -= cur;
    	}

    	return r - sum;
    }

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 3/5
    ```

    Asymptotics of the solution is $O (\sqrt{n})$.

    ### The number of integers in a given interval which are multiple of at least one of the given numbers

    Given $n$ numbers $a_i$ and number $r$. You want to count the number of integers in the interval $[1; r]$ that are multiple of at least one of the $a_i$.

    The solution algorithm is almost identical to the one for previous task â€” construct the formula of inclusion-exclusion on the numbers $a_i$, i.e. each term in this formula is the number of numbers divisible by a given subset of numbers $a_i$ (in other words, divisible by their [least common multiple](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md)).

    So we will now iterate over all $2^n$ subsets of integers $a_i$ with $O(n \log r)$ operations to find their least common multiple, adding or subtracting the number of multiples of it in the interval. Asymptotics is $O (2^n\cdot n\cdot \log r)$.

    ### The number of strings that satisfy a given pattern

    Consider $n$ patterns of strings of the same length, consisting only of letters ($a...z$) or question marks. You're also given a number $k$. A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. The task is to count the number of strings that match exactly $k$ of the patterns (first problem) and at least $k$ of the patterns (second problem).

    Notice first that we can easily count the number of strings that satisfy at once all of the specified patterns. To do this, simply "cross" patterns: iterate though the positions ("slots") and look at a position over all patterns. If all patterns have a question mark in this position, the character can be any letter from $a$ to $z$. Otherwise, the character of this position is uniquely defined by the patterns that do not contain a question mark.

    Learn now to solve the first version of the problem: when the string must satisfy exactly $k$ of the patterns.

    To solve it, iterate and fix a specific subset $X$ from the set of patterns consisting of $k$ patterns. Then we have to count the number of strings that satisfy this set of patterns, and only matches it, that is, they don't match any other pattern. We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a slightly different manner: we sum on all supersets $Y$ (subsets from the original set of strings that contain $X$), and either add to the current answer or subtract it from the number of strings:

    $$ ans(X) = \sum_{Y \supseteq X} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Where $f(Y)$ is the number of strings that match $Y$ (at least $Y$).

    (If you have a hard time figuring out this, you can try drawing Venn Diagrams.)

    If we sum up on all $ans(X)$, we will get the final answer:

    $$ ans = \sum_{X ~ : ~ |X| = k} ans(X) $$

    However, asymptotics of this solution is $O(3^k \cdot k)$. To improve it, notice that different $ans(X)$ computations very often share $Y$ sets.

    We will reverse the formula of inclusion-exclusion and sum in terms of $Y$ sets. Now it becomes clear that the same set $Y$ would be taken into account in the computation of $ans(X)$ of $\binom{|Y|}{k}$ sets with the same sign $(-1)^{|Y| - k}$.

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Now our solution has asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    We will now solve the second version of the problem: find the number of strings that match **at least** $k$ of the patterns.

    Of course, we can just use the solution to the first version of the problem and add the answers for sets with size greater than $k$. However, you may notice that in this problem, a set |Y| is considered in the formula for all sets with size $\ge k$ which are contained in $Y$. That said, we can write the part of the expression that is being multiplied by $f(Y)$ as:


    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-1} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+1} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-2} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+2} + \cdots + (-1)^{|Y|-|Y|} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{|Y|} $$

    Looking at Graham's (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. "Concrete mathematics" [1998] ), we see a well-known formula for [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \cdot \binom{n}{k} = (-1)^m \cdot \binom{n-1}{m} $$

    Applying it here, we find that the entire sum of binomial coefficients is minimized:

    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} $$

    Thus, for this task, we also obtained a solution with the asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$:

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    ### The number of ways of going from a cell to another

    There is a field $n \times m$, and $k$ of its cells are impassable walls. A robot is initially at the cell $(1,1)$ (bottom left). The robot can only move right or up, and eventually it needs to get into the cell $(n,m)$, avoiding all obstacles. You need to count the number of ways he can do it.

    Assume that the sizes $n$ and $m$ are very large (say, $10^9$), and the number $k$ is small (around $100$).

    For now, sort the obstacles by their coordinate $x$, and in case of equality â€” coordinate $y$.

    Also just learn how to solve a problem without obstacles: i.e. learn how to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another. In one axis, we need to go through $x$ cells, and on the other, $y$ cells. From simple combinatorics, we get a formula using [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$\binom{x+y}{x}$$

    Now to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another, avoiding all obstacles, you can use inclusion-exclusion to solve the inverse problem: count the number of ways to walk through the board stepping at a subset of obstacles (and subtract it from the total number of ways).

    When iterating over a subset of the obstacles that we'll step, to count the number of ways to do this simply multiply the number of all paths from starting cell to the first of the selected obstacles, a first obstacle to the second, and so on, and then add or subtract this number from the answer, in accordance with the standard formula of inclusion-exclusion.

    However, this will again be non-polynomial in complexity $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    Here goes a polynomial solution:

    We will use dynamic programming. For convenience, push (1,1) to the beginning and (n,m) at the end of the obstacles array. Let's compute the numbers $d[i]$ â€” the number of ways to get from the starting point ($0-th$) to $i-th$, without stepping on any other obstacle (except for $i$, of course). We will compute this number for all the obstacle cells, and also for the ending one.

    Let's forget for a second the obstacles and just count the number of paths from cell $0$ to $i$. We need to consider some "bad" paths, the ones that pass through the obstacles, and subtract them from the total number of ways of going from $0$ to $i$.

    When considering an obstacle $t$ between $0$ and $i$ ($0 < t < i$), on which we can step, we see that the number of paths from $0$ to $i$ that pass through $t$ which have $t$ as the **first obstacle between start and $i$**. We can compute that as: $d[t]$ multiplied by the number of arbitrary paths from $t$ to $i$. We can count the number of "bad" ways summing this for all $t$ between $0$ and $i$.

    We can compute $d[i]$ in $O(k)$ for $O(k)$ obstacles, so this solution has complexity $O(k^2)$.

    ### The number of coprime quadruples

    You're given $n$ numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You are required to count the number of ways to choose four numbers so that their combined greatest common divisor is equal to one.

    We will solve the inverse problem â€” compute the number of "bad" quadruples, i.e. quadruples in which all numbers are divisible by a number $d > 1$.

    We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle while summing over all possible groups of four numbers divisible by a divisor $d$.

    $$ans = \sum_{d \ge 2} (-1)^{deg(d)-1} \cdot f(d)$$

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function sum_length_of_names(names):
       total_length = 0
       for each name in names:
           if name starts with an uppercase letter:
               total_length += length of name
       return total_length
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def sum_length_of_names(names):
    # Initialize a variable to hold the total length of valid names
    total_length = 0
    
    # Iterate through each name in the provided list
    for name in names:
        # Check if the first character of the name is uppercase
        if name and name[0].isupper():
            # If it is, add the length of the name to the total length
            total_length += len(name)
    
    # Return the total length of names that start with an uppercase letter
    return total_length
```
