It relates the sizes of individual sets with their union.\n\n    ## Statement\n\n    ### The verbal formula\n\n    The inclusion-exclusion principle can be expressed as follows:\n\n    To compute the size of a union of multiple sets, it is necessary to sum the sizes of these sets **separately**, and then subtract the sizes of all **pairwise** intersections of the sets, then add back the size of the intersections of **triples** of the sets, subtract the size of **quadruples** of the sets, and so on, up to the intersection of **all** sets.\n\n    ### The formulation in terms of sets\n\n    The above definition can be expressed mathematically as follows:\n\n    $$\\left| \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right| = \\sum_{i=1}^n|A_i| - \\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n} |A_i \\cap A_j| + \\sum _{1\\leq i<j<k\\leq n}|A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k| - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} | A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n |$$\n\n    And in a more compact way:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right| = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\\Biggl |}\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}{\\Biggr |}$$\n\n    ### The formulation using Venn diagrams\n\n    Let the diagram show three sets $A$, $B$ and $C$:\n\n    ![Venn diagram](venn-inclusion-exclusion.png \"Venn diagram\")\n\n    Then the area of their union $A \\cup B \\cup C$ is equal to the sum of the areas $A$, $B$ and $C$ less double-covered areas $A \\cap B$, $A \\cap C$, $B \\cap C$, but with the addition of the area covered by three sets $A \\cap B \\cap C$:\n\n    $$S(A \\cup B \\cup C) = S(A) + S(B) + S(C) - S(A \\cap B) - S(A \\cap C) - S(B \\cap C) + S(A \\cap B \\cap C)$$\n\n    It can also be generalized for an association of $n$ sets.\n\n    ### The formulation in terms of probability theory\n\n    If $A_i$ $(i = 1,2...n)$ are events and ${\\cal P}(A_i)$ the probability of an event from $A_i$ to occur, then the probability of their union (i.e. the probability that at least one of the events occur) is equal to:\n\n    $$\\begin{eqnarray}\n    {\\cal P} \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) &=& \\sum_{i=1}^n{\\cal P}(A_i)\\ - \\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq n} {\\cal P}(A_i \\cap A_j)\\  + \\\\\n    &+& \\sum _{1\\leq i<j<k\\leq n}{\\cal P}(A_i \\cap A_j \\cap A_k) - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1} {\\cal P}( A_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap A_n )\n    \\end{eqnarray}$$\n\n    And in a more compact way:\n\n    $${\\cal P} \\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right) = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}\\ {\\cal P}{\\Biggl (}\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}{\\Biggr )}$$\n\n    ## Proof\n\n    For the proof it is convenient to use the mathematical formulation in terms of set theory:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i \\right| = \\sum_{\\emptyset \\neq J\\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}} (-1)^{|J|-1}{\\Biggl |}\\bigcap_{j\\in J}A_{j}{\\Biggr |}$$\n\n    We want to prove that any element contained in at least one of the sets $A_i$ will occur in the formula only once (note that elements which are not present in any of the sets $A_i$ will never be considered on the right part of the formula).\n\n    Consider an element $x$ occurring in $k \\geq 1$ sets $A_i$. We will show it is counted only once in the formula. Note that:\n\n    * in terms which $|J| = 1$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\\ k$** times;\n    * in terms which $|J| = 2$, the item $x$ will be counted **$-\\ \\binom{k}{2}$** times - because it will be counted in those terms that include two of the $k$ sets containing $x$;\n    * in terms which $|J| = 3$, the item $x$ will be counted **$+\\ \\binom{k}{3}$** times;\n    * $\\cdots$\n    * in terms which $|J| = k$, the item $x$ will be counted **$(-1)^{k-1}\\cdot \\binom{k}{k}$** times;\n    * in terms which $|J| \\gt k$, the item $x$ will be counted **zero** times;\n\n    This leads us to the following sum of [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):\n\n    $$ T = \\binom{k}{1} - \\binom{k}{2} + \\binom{k}{3} - \\cdots + (-1)^{i-1}\\cdot \\binom{k}{i} + \\cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\\cdot \\binom{k}{k}$$\n\n    This expression is very similar to the binomial expansion of $(1 - x)^k$:\n\n    $$ (1 - x)^k = \\binom{k}{0} - \\binom{k}{1} \\cdot x + \\binom{k}{2} \\cdot x^2 - \\binom{k}{3} \\cdot x^3 + \\cdots + (-1)^k\\cdot \\binom{k}{k} \\cdot x^k $$\n\n    When $x = 1$, $(1 - x)^k$ looks a lot like $T$. However, the expression has an additional $\\binom{k}{0} = 1$, and it is multiplied by $-1$. That leads us to $(1 - 1)^k = 1 - T$. Therefore $T = 1 - (1 - 1)^k = 1$, what was required to prove. The element is counted only once.\n\n    ## Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly $r$ sets {data-toc-label=\"Generalization for calculating number of elements in exactly r sets\"}\n\n    Inclusion-exclusion principle can be rewritten to calculate number of elements which are present in zero sets:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcap_{i=1}^n \\overline{A_i}\\right|=\\sum_{m=0}^n (-1)^m \\sum_{|X|=m} \\left|\\bigcap_{i\\in X} A_{i}\\right|$$\n\n    Consider its generalization to calculate number of elements which are present in exactly $r$ sets:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcup_{|B|=r}\\left[\\bigcap_{i \\in B} A_i \\cap \\bigcap_{j \\not\\in B} \\overline{A_j}\\right]\\right|=\\sum_{m=r}^n (-1)^{m-r}\\dbinom{m}{r} \\sum_{|X|=m} \\left|\\bigcap_{i \\in X} A_{i}\\right|$$\n\n    To prove this formula, consider some particular $B$. Due to basic inclusion-exclusion principle we can say about it that:\n\n    $$\\left|\\bigcap_{i \\in B} A_i \\cap \\bigcap_{j \\not \\in B} \\overline{A_j}\\right|=\\sum_{m=r}^{n} (-1)^{m-r} \\sum_{\\substack{|X|=m \\newline B \\subset X}}\\left|\\bigcap_{i\\in X} A_{i}\\right|$$\n\n    The sets on the left side do not intersect for different $B$, thus we can sum them up directly. Also one should note that any set $X$ will always have coefficient $(-1)^{m-r}$ if it occurs and it will occur for exactly $\\dbinom{m}{r}$ sets $B$. \n\n    ## Usage when solving problems\n\n    The inclusion-exclusion principle is hard to understand without studying its applications.\n\n    First, we will look at three simplest tasks \"at paper\", illustrating applications of the principle, and then consider more practical problems which are difficult to solve without inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\n    Tasks asking to \"find the **number** of ways\" are worth of note, as they sometimes lead to polynomial solutions, not necessarily exponential.\n\n    ### A simple task on permutations\n\n    Task: count how many permutations of numbers from $0$ to $9$ exist such that the first element is greater than $1$ and the last one is less than $8$.\n\n    Let's count the number of \"bad\" permutations, that is, permutations in which the first element is $\\leq 1$ and/or the last is $\\geq 8$.\n\n    We will denote by $X$ the set of permutations in which the first element is $\\leq 1$ and $Y$ the set of permutations in which the last element is $\\geq 8$. Then the number of \"bad\" permutations, as on the inclusion-exclusion formula, will be:\n\n    $$ |X \\cup Y| = |X| + |Y| - |X \\cap Y| $$\n\n    After a simple combinatorial calculation, we will get to:\n\n    $$ 2 \\cdot 9! + 2 \\cdot 9! - 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 8! $$\n\n    The only thing left is to subtract this number from the total of $10!$ to get the number of \"good\" permutations.\n\n    ### A simple task on (0, 1, 2) sequences\n\n    Task: count how many sequences of length $n$ exist consisting only of numbers $0,1,2$ such that each number occurs **at least once**.\n\n    Again let us turn to the inverse problem, i.e. we calculate the number of sequences which do **not** contain **at least one** of the numbers.\n\n    Let's denote by $A_i (i = 0,1,2)$ the set of sequences in which the digit $i$ does **not** occur.\n    The formula of inclusion-exclusion on the number of \"bad\" sequences will be:\n\n    $$ |A_0 \\cup A_1 \\cup A_2| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2| - |A_0 \\cap A_1| - |A_0 \\cap A_2| - |A_1 \\cap A_2| + |A_0 \\cap A_1 \\cap A_2| $$\n\n    * The size of each $A_i$ is $2^n$, as each sequence can only contain two of the digits.\n    * The size of each pairwise intersection $A_i \\cap A_j$  is equal to $1$, as there will be only one digit to build the sequence.\n    * The size of the intersection of all three sets is equal to $0$, as there will be no digits to build the sequence.\n\n    As we solved the inverse problem, we subtract it from the total of $3^n$ sequences:\n\n    $$3^n - (3 \\cdot 2^n - 3 \\cdot 1 + 0)$$\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Finding the nearest pair of points\n    Part: 1/3\n    # Finding the nearest pair of points\n\n    ## Problem statement\n\n    Given $n$ points on the plane. Each point $p_i$ is defined by its coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$. It is required to find among them two such points, such that the distance between them is minimal:\n\n    $$ \\min_{\\scriptstyle i, j=0 \\ldots n-1,\\atop \\scriptstyle i \\neq j } \\rho (p_i, p_j). $$\n\n    We take the usual Euclidean distances:\n\n    $$ \\rho (p_i,p_j) = \\sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2 + (y_i-y_j)^2} .$$\n\n    The trivial algorithm - iterating over all pairs and calculating the distance for each \u2014 works in $O(n^2)$. \n\n    The algorithm running in time $O(n \\log n)$ is described below. This algorithm was proposed by Shamos and Hoey in 1975. (Source: Ch. 5 Notes of _Algorithm Design_ by Kleinberg & Tardos, also see [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4567872)) Preparata and Shamos also showed that this algorithm is optimal in the decision tree model.\n\n    ## Algorithm\n    We construct an algorithm according to the general scheme of **divide-and-conquer** algorithms: the algorithm is designed as a recursive function, to which we pass a set of points; this recursive function splits this set in half, calls itself recursively on each half, and then performs some operations to combine the answers. The operation of combining consist of  detecting the cases when one point of the optimal solution fell into one half, and the other point into the other (in this case, recursive calls from each of the halves cannot detect this pair separately). The main difficulty, as always in case of divide and conquer algorithms, lies in the effective implementation of the merging stage. If a set of $n$ points is passed to the recursive function, then the merge stage should work no more than $O(n)$, then the asymptotics of the whole algorithm $T(n)$ will be found from the equation:\n\n    $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n).$$ \n\n    The solution to this equation, as is known, is $T(n) = O(n \\log n).$\n\n    So, we proceed on to the construction of the algorithm. In order to come to an effective implementation of the merge stage in the future, we will divide the set of points into two subsets, according to their $x$-coordinates: In fact, we draw some vertical line dividing the set of points into two subsets of approximately the same size. It is convenient to make such a partition as follows: We sort the points in the standard way as pairs of numbers, ie.:\n\n    $$p_i < p_j \\Longleftrightarrow (x_i < x_j) \\lor \\Big(\\left(x_i = x_j\\right) \\wedge \\left(y_i < y_j \\right) \\Big) $$\n\n    Then take the middle point after sorting $p_m (m = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor)$, and all the points before it and the $p_m$ itself are assigned to the first half, and all the points after it - to the second half:\n\n    $$A_1 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = 0 \\ldots m \\}$$\n\n    $$A_2 = \\{p_i \\ | \\ i = m + 1 \\ldots n-1 \\}.$$ \n\n    Now, calling recursively on each of the sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, we will find the answers $h_1$ and $h_2$ for each of the halves. And take the best of them: $h = \\min(h_1, h_2)$.\n\n    Now we need to make a **merge stage**, i.e. we try to find such pairs of points, for which the distance between which is less than $h$ and one point is lying in $A_1$ and the other in $A_2$.\n    It is obvious that it is sufficient to consider only those points that are separated from the vertical line by a distance less than $h$, i.e. the set $B$ of the points considered at this stage is equal to:\n\n    $$B = \\{ p_i\\ | \\ | x_i - x_m\\ | < h \\}.$$ \n\n    For each point in the set $B$, we try to find the points that are closer to it than $h$. For example, it is sufficient to consider only those points whose $y$-coordinate differs by no more than $h$. Moreover, it makes no sense to consider those points whose $y$-coordinate is greater than the $y$-coordinate of the current point. Thus, for each point $p_i$ we define the set of considered points $C(p_i)$ as follows:\n\n    $$C(p_i) = \\{ p_j\\ |\\ p_j \\in B,\\ \\ y_i - h < y_j \\le y_i \\}.$$\n\n    If we sort the points of the set $B$ by $y$-coordinate, it will be very easy to find $C(p_i)$: these are several points in a row ahead to the point $p_i$.\n\n    So, in the new notation, the **merging stage** looks like this: build a set $B$, sort the points in it by $y$-coordinate, then for each point $p_i \\in B$ consider all points $p_j \\in C(p_i)$, and for each pair $(p_i,p_j)$ calculate the distance and compare with the current best distance.\n\n    At first glance, this is still a non-optimal algorithm: it seems that the sizes of sets $C(p_i)$ will be of order $n$, and the required asymptotics will not work. However, surprisingly, it can be proved that the size of each of the sets $C(p_i)$ is a quantity $O(1)$, i.e. it does not exceed some small constant regardless of the points themselves. Proof of this fact is given in the next section.\n\n    Finally, we pay attention to the sorting, which the above algorithm contains: first,sorting by pairs $(x, y)$, and then second, sorting the elements of the set $B$ by $y$. In fact, both of these sorts inside the recursive function can be eliminated (otherwise we would not reach the $O(n)$ estimate for the **merging stage**, and the general asymptotics of the algorithm would be $O(n \\log^2 n)$). It is easy to get rid of the first sort \u2014 it is enough to perform this sort before starting the recursion: after all, the elements themselves do not change inside the recursion, so there is no need to sort again. With the second sorting a little more difficult to perform, performing it previously will not work. But, remembering the merge sort, which also works on the principle of divide-and-conquer, we can simply embed this sort in our recursion. Let recursion, taking some set of points (as we remember,ordered by pairs $(x, y)$), return the same set, but sorted by the $y$-coordinate. To do this, simply merge (in $O(n)$) the two results returned by recursive calls. This will result in a set sorted by $y$-coordinate.\n\n    ## Evaluation of the asymptotics\n\n    To show that the above algorithm is actually executed in $O(n \\log n)$, we need to prove the following fact: $|C(p_i)| = O(1)$.\n\n    So, let us consider some point $p_i$; recall that the set $C(p_i)$ is a set of points whose $y$-coordinate lies in the segment $[y_i-h; y_i]$, and, moreover, along the $x$ coordinate, the point $p_i$ itself, and all the points of the set $C(p_i)$ lie in the band width $2h$. In other words, the points we are considering $p_i$ and $C(p_i)$ lie in a rectangle of size $2h \\times h$.\n\n    Our task is to estimate the maximum number of points that can lie in this rectangle $2h \\times h$; thus, we estimate the maximum size of the set $C(p_i)$. At the same time, when evaluating, we must not forget that there may be repeated points.\n\n    Remember that $h$ was obtained from the results of two recursive calls \u2014 on sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ contains points to the left of the partition line and partially on it, $A_2$ contains the remaining points of the partition line and points to the right of it. For any pair of points from $A_1$, as well as from $A_2$, the distance can not be less than $h$ \u2014 otherwise it would mean incorrect operation of the recursive function.\n\n    To estimate the maximum number of points in the rectangle $2h \\times h$ we divide it into two squares $h \\times h$, the first square include all points $C(p_i) \\cap A_1$, and the second contains all the others, i.e. $C(p_i) \\cap A_2$. It follows from the above considerations that in each of these squares the distance between any two points is at least $h$.\n\n    We show that there are at most four points in each square. For example, this can be done as follows: divide the square into $4$ sub-squares with sides $h/2$. Then there can be no more than one point in each of these sub-squares (since even the diagonal is equal to $h / \\sqrt{2}$, which is less than $h$). Therefore, there can be no more than $4$ points in the whole square.\n\n    So, we have proved that in a rectangle $2h \\times h$ can not be more than $4 \\cdot 2 = 8$ points, and, therefore, the size of the set $C(p_i)$ cannot exceed $7$, as required.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Z-function and its calculation\n    Part: 2/2\n    ```\n\n    ### Comments on this implementation\n\n    The whole solution is given as a function which returns an array of length $n$ -- the Z-function of $s$.\n\n    Array $z$ is initially filled with zeros. The current rightmost match segment is assumed to be $[0; 0)$ (that is, a deliberately small segment which doesn't contain any $i$).\n\n    Inside the loop for $i = 1 \\dots n - 1$ we first determine the initial value $z[i]$ -- it will either remain zero or be computed using the above formula.\n\n    Thereafter, the trivial algorithm attempts to increase the value of $z[i]$ as much as possible.\n\n    In the end, if it's required (that is, if $i + z[i] > r$), we update the rightmost match segment $[l, r)$.\n\n    ## Asymptotic behavior of the algorithm\n\n    We will prove that the above algorithm has a running time that is linear in the length of the string -- thus, it's $O(n)$.\n\n    The proof is very simple.\n\n    We are interested in the nested `while` loop, since everything else is just a bunch of constant operations which sums up to $O(n)$.\n\n    We will show that **each iteration** of the `while` loop will increase the right border $r$ of the match segment.\n\n    To do that, we will consider both branches of the algorithm:\n\n    *   $i \\geq r$\n\n        In this case, either the `while` loop won't make any iteration (if $s[0] \\ne s[i]$), or it will take a few iterations, starting at position $i$, each time moving one character to the right. After that, the right border $r$ will necessarily be updated.\n\n        So we have found that, when $i \\geq r$, each iteration of the `while` loop increases the value of the new $r$ index.\n\n    *   $i < r$\n\n        In this case, we initialize $z[i]$ to a certain value $z_0$ given by the above formula. Let's compare this initial value $z_0$ to the value $r - i$. We will have three cases:\n\n          *   $z_0 < r - i$\n\n              We prove that in this case no iteration of the `while` loop will take place.\n\n              It's easy to prove, for example, by contradiction: if the `while` loop made at least one iteration, it would mean that initial approximation $z[i] = z_0$ was inaccurate (less than the match's actual length). But since $s[l \\dots r)$ and $s[0 \\dots r-l)$ are the same, this would imply that $z[i-l]$ holds the wrong value (less than it should be).\n\n              Thus, since $z[i-l]$ is correct and it is less than $r - i$, it follows that this value coincides with the required value $z[i]$.\n\n          *   $z_0 = r - i$\n\n              In this case, the `while` loop can make a few iterations, but each of them will lead to an increase in the value of the $r$ index because we will start comparing from $s[r]$, which will climb beyond the $[l, r)$ interval.\n\n          *   $z_0 > r - i$\n\n              This option is impossible, by definition of $z_0$.\n\n    So, we have proved that each iteration of the inner loop make the $r$ pointer advance to the right. Since $r$ can't be more than $n-1$, this means that the inner loop won't make more than $n-1$ iterations.\n\n    As the rest of the algorithm obviously works in $O(n)$, we have proved that the whole algorithm for computing Z-functions runs in linear time.\n\n    ## Applications\n\n    We will now consider some uses of Z-functions for specific tasks.\n\n    These applications will be largely similar to applications of [prefix function](prefix-function.md).\n\n    ### Search the substring\n\n    To avoid confusion, we call $t$ the **string of text**, and $p$ the **pattern**. The problem is: find all occurrences of the pattern $p$ inside the text $t$.\n\n    To solve this problem, we create a new string $s = p + \\diamond + t$, that is, we apply string concatenation to $p$ and $t$ but we also put a separator character $\\diamond$ in the middle (we'll choose $\\diamond$ so that it will certainly not be present anywhere in the strings $p$ or $t$).\n\n    Compute the Z-function for $s$. Then, for any $i$ in the interval $[0; \\; \\operatorname{length}(t) - 1]$, we will consider the corresponding value $k = z[i + \\operatorname{length}(p) + 1]$. If $k$ is equal to $\\operatorname{length}(p)$ then we know there is one occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$, otherwise there is no occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$.\n\n    The running time (and memory consumption) is $O(\\operatorname{length}(t) + \\operatorname{length}(p))$.\n\n    ### Number of distinct substrings in a string\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$, count the number of distinct substrings of $s$.\n\n    We'll solve this problem iteratively. That is: knowing the current number of different substrings, recalculate this amount after adding to the end of $s$ one character.\n\n    So, let $k$ be the current number of distinct substrings of $s$. We append a new character $c$ to $s$. Obviously, there can be some new substrings ending in this new character $c$ (namely, all those strings that end with this symbol and that we haven't encountered yet).\n\n    Take a string $t = s + c$ and invert it (write its characters in reverse order). Our task is now to count how many prefixes of $t$ are not found anywhere else in $t$. Let's compute the Z-function of $t$ and find its maximum value $z_{max}$. Obviously, $t$'s prefix of length $z_{max}$ occurs also somewhere in the middle of $t$. Clearly, shorter prefixes also occur.\n\n    So, we have found that the number of new substrings that appear when symbol $c$ is appended to $s$ is equal to $\\operatorname{length}(t) - z_{max}$.\n\n    Consequently, the running time of this solution is $O(n^2)$ for a string of length $n$.\n\n    It's worth noting that in exactly the same way we can recalculate, still in $O(n)$ time, the number of distinct substrings when appending a character in the beginning of the string, as well as when removing it (from the end or the beginning).\n\n    ### String compression\n\n    Given a string $s$ of length $n$. Find its shortest \"compressed\" representation, that is: find a string $t$ of shortest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.\n\n    A solution is: compute the Z-function of $s$, loop through all $i$ such that $i$ divides $n$. Stop at the first $i$ such that $i + z[i] = n$. Then, the string $s$ can be compressed to the length $i$.\n\n    The proof for this fact is the same as the solution which uses the [prefix function](prefix-function.md).\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
