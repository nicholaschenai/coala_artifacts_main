INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/422 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we will calculate the cubes of 1 and 2, find their average, and return that value.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers, we can follow these steps:
   - Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the cubes.
   - Loop through the numbers from 1 to `n`, calculate the cube of each number, and add it to the sum.
   - After the loop, divide the total sum by `n` to get the average.
   - Return the average.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_Average_Of_Cube(n):
       sum_of_cubes = 0
       for i from 1 to n:
           sum_of_cubes += i^3
       average = sum_of_cubes / n
       return average
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_Average_Of_Cube(n):
    # Initialize a variable to hold the sum of cubes
    sum_of_cubes = 0
    
    # Loop through the first n natural numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the cube of the current number and add it to the sum
        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3
    
    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum of cubes by n
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    
    # Return the calculated average
    return average

    Chapter: Greedy algorithms
    Section: Minimizing sums
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Minimizing sums}

    We next consider a problem where
    we are given $n$ numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$
    and our task is to find a value $x$
    that minimizes the sum
    \[|a_1-x|^c+|a_2-x|^c+\cdots+|a_n-x|^c.\]
    We focus on the cases $c=1$ and $c=2$.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=1$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[|a_1-x|+|a_2-x|+\cdots+|a_n-x|.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=2$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    |1-2|+|2-2|+|9-2|+|2-2|+|6-2|=12.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \textit{median} of the numbers,
    i.e., the middle number after sorting.
    For example, the list $[1,2,9,2,6]$
    becomes $[1,2,2,6,9]$ after sorting,
    so the median is 2.

    The median is an optimal choice,
    because if $x$ is smaller than the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by increasing $x$,
    and if $x$ is larger then the median,
    the sum becomes smaller by decreasing $x$.
    Hence, the optimal solution is that $x$
    is the median.
    If $n$ is even and there are two medians,
    both medians and all values between them
    are optimal choices.

    \subsubsection{Case $c=2$}

    In this case, we should minimize the sum
    \[(a_1-x)^2+(a_2-x)^2+\cdots+(a_n-x)^2.\]
    For example, if the numbers are $[1,2,9,2,6]$,
    the best solution is to select $x=4$
    which produces the sum
    \[
    (1-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(9-4)^2+(2-4)^2+(6-4)^2=46.
    \]
    In the general case, the best choice for $x$
    is the \emph{average} of the numbers.
    In the example the average is $(1+2+9+2+6)/5=4$.
    This result can be derived by presenting
    the sum as follows:
    \[
    nx^2 - 2x(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n) + (a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)
    \]
    The last part does not depend on $x$,
    so we can ignore it.
    The remaining parts form a function
    $nx^2-2xs$ where $s=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n$.
    This is a parabola opening upwards
    with roots $x=0$ and $x=2s/n$,
    and the minimum value is the average
    of the roots $x=s/n$, i.e.,
    the average of the numbers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$.

    Title: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
    Part: 3/5
    ```

    Asymptotics of the solution is $O (\sqrt{n})$.

    ### The number of integers in a given interval which are multiple of at least one of the given numbers

    Given $n$ numbers $a_i$ and number $r$. You want to count the number of integers in the interval $[1; r]$ that are multiple of at least one of the $a_i$.

    The solution algorithm is almost identical to the one for previous task — construct the formula of inclusion-exclusion on the numbers $a_i$, i.e. each term in this formula is the number of numbers divisible by a given subset of numbers $a_i$ (in other words, divisible by their [least common multiple](../algebra/euclid-algorithm.md)).

    So we will now iterate over all $2^n$ subsets of integers $a_i$ with $O(n \log r)$ operations to find their least common multiple, adding or subtracting the number of multiples of it in the interval. Asymptotics is $O (2^n\cdot n\cdot \log r)$.

    ### The number of strings that satisfy a given pattern

    Consider $n$ patterns of strings of the same length, consisting only of letters ($a...z$) or question marks. You're also given a number $k$. A string matches a pattern if it has the same length as the pattern, and at each position, either the corresponding characters are equal or the character in the pattern is a question mark. The task is to count the number of strings that match exactly $k$ of the patterns (first problem) and at least $k$ of the patterns (second problem).

    Notice first that we can easily count the number of strings that satisfy at once all of the specified patterns. To do this, simply "cross" patterns: iterate though the positions ("slots") and look at a position over all patterns. If all patterns have a question mark in this position, the character can be any letter from $a$ to $z$. Otherwise, the character of this position is uniquely defined by the patterns that do not contain a question mark.

    Learn now to solve the first version of the problem: when the string must satisfy exactly $k$ of the patterns.

    To solve it, iterate and fix a specific subset $X$ from the set of patterns consisting of $k$ patterns. Then we have to count the number of strings that satisfy this set of patterns, and only matches it, that is, they don't match any other pattern. We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle in a slightly different manner: we sum on all supersets $Y$ (subsets from the original set of strings that contain $X$), and either add to the current answer or subtract it from the number of strings:

    $$ ans(X) = \sum_{Y \supseteq X} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Where $f(Y)$ is the number of strings that match $Y$ (at least $Y$).

    (If you have a hard time figuring out this, you can try drawing Venn Diagrams.)

    If we sum up on all $ans(X)$, we will get the final answer:

    $$ ans = \sum_{X ~ : ~ |X| = k} ans(X) $$

    However, asymptotics of this solution is $O(3^k \cdot k)$. To improve it, notice that different $ans(X)$ computations very often share $Y$ sets.

    We will reverse the formula of inclusion-exclusion and sum in terms of $Y$ sets. Now it becomes clear that the same set $Y$ would be taken into account in the computation of $ans(X)$ of $\binom{|Y|}{k}$ sets with the same sign $(-1)^{|Y| - k}$.

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    Now our solution has asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    We will now solve the second version of the problem: find the number of strings that match **at least** $k$ of the patterns.

    Of course, we can just use the solution to the first version of the problem and add the answers for sets with size greater than $k$. However, you may notice that in this problem, a set |Y| is considered in the formula for all sets with size $\ge k$ which are contained in $Y$. That said, we can write the part of the expression that is being multiplied by $f(Y)$ as:


    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-1} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+1} + (-1)^{|Y|-k-2} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{k+2} + \cdots + (-1)^{|Y|-|Y|} \cdot \binom{|Y|}{|Y|} $$

    Looking at Graham's (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik. "Concrete mathematics" [1998] ), we see a well-known formula for [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$ \sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k \cdot \binom{n}{k} = (-1)^m \cdot \binom{n-1}{m} $$

    Applying it here, we find that the entire sum of binomial coefficients is minimized:

    $$ (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} $$

    Thus, for this task, we also obtained a solution with the asymptotics $O(2^k \cdot k)$:

    $$ ans = \sum_{Y ~ : ~ |Y| \ge k} (-1)^{|Y|-k} \cdot \binom{|Y|-1}{|Y|-k} \cdot f(Y) $$

    ### The number of ways of going from a cell to another

    There is a field $n \times m$, and $k$ of its cells are impassable walls. A robot is initially at the cell $(1,1)$ (bottom left). The robot can only move right or up, and eventually it needs to get into the cell $(n,m)$, avoiding all obstacles. You need to count the number of ways he can do it.

    Assume that the sizes $n$ and $m$ are very large (say, $10^9$), and the number $k$ is small (around $100$).

    For now, sort the obstacles by their coordinate $x$, and in case of equality — coordinate $y$.

    Also just learn how to solve a problem without obstacles: i.e. learn how to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another. In one axis, we need to go through $x$ cells, and on the other, $y$ cells. From simple combinatorics, we get a formula using [binomial coefficients](binomial-coefficients.md):

    $$\binom{x+y}{x}$$

    Now to count the number of ways to get from one cell to another, avoiding all obstacles, you can use inclusion-exclusion to solve the inverse problem: count the number of ways to walk through the board stepping at a subset of obstacles (and subtract it from the total number of ways).

    When iterating over a subset of the obstacles that we'll step, to count the number of ways to do this simply multiply the number of all paths from starting cell to the first of the selected obstacles, a first obstacle to the second, and so on, and then add or subtract this number from the answer, in accordance with the standard formula of inclusion-exclusion.

    However, this will again be non-polynomial in complexity $O(2^k \cdot k)$.

    Here goes a polynomial solution:

    We will use dynamic programming. For convenience, push (1,1) to the beginning and (n,m) at the end of the obstacles array. Let's compute the numbers $d[i]$ — the number of ways to get from the starting point ($0-th$) to $i-th$, without stepping on any other obstacle (except for $i$, of course). We will compute this number for all the obstacle cells, and also for the ending one.

    Let's forget for a second the obstacles and just count the number of paths from cell $0$ to $i$. We need to consider some "bad" paths, the ones that pass through the obstacles, and subtract them from the total number of ways of going from $0$ to $i$.

    When considering an obstacle $t$ between $0$ and $i$ ($0 < t < i$), on which we can step, we see that the number of paths from $0$ to $i$ that pass through $t$ which have $t$ as the **first obstacle between start and $i$**. We can compute that as: $d[t]$ multiplied by the number of arbitrary paths from $t$ to $i$. We can count the number of "bad" ways summing this for all $t$ between $0$ and $i$.

    We can compute $d[i]$ in $O(k)$ for $O(k)$ obstacles, so this solution has complexity $O(k^2)$.

    ### The number of coprime quadruples

    You're given $n$ numbers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. You are required to count the number of ways to choose four numbers so that their combined greatest common divisor is equal to one.

    We will solve the inverse problem — compute the number of "bad" quadruples, i.e. quadruples in which all numbers are divisible by a number $d > 1$.

    We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle while summing over all possible groups of four numbers divisible by a divisor $d$.

    $$ans = \sum_{d \ge 2} (-1)^{deg(d)-1} \cdot f(d)$$
