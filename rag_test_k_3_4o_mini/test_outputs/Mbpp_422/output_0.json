    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a Python function that calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should return this average as a floating-point number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers, we can follow these steps:\n   - Calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.\n   - The formula for the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is \\((n(n + 1) / 2)^2\\).\n   - Once we have the sum, we divide it by `n` to get the average.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_Average_Of_Cube(n):\n       sum_of_cubes = (n * (n + 1) / 2) ** 2\n       average = sum_of_cubes / n\n       return average\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\n# Function to calculate the average of cubes of the first n natural numbers\ndef find_Average_Of_Cube(n):\n    # Calculate the sum of cubes using the formula (n(n + 1) / 2) ** 2\n    sum_of_cubes = (n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2\n    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum of cubes by n\n    average = sum_of_cubes / n\n    # Return the calculated average\n    return average\n```",
