INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/118 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and splits it into a list of substrings based on spaces. For example, if the input is "python programming", the output should be a list containing the words ['python', 'programming'].

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To solve this problem, we can use the built-in string method `split()`, which splits a string into a list where each word is a separate element. By default, `split()` will use any whitespace as the delimiter, which is exactly what we need for this task.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   - Define a function named `string_to_list` that takes a single string parameter.
   - Use the `split()` method on the input string to divide it into a list of words.
   - Return the resulting list.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
# Define a function named string_to_list that takes a string as input
def string_to_list(input_string: str) -> list:
    # Use the split method to divide the string into a list of words
    words_list = input_string.split()
    # Return the list of words
    return words_list

    Title: String Hashing
    Part: 1/2
    # String Hashing

    Hashing algorithms are helpful in solving a lot of problems.

    We want to solve the problem of comparing strings efficiently.
    The brute force way of doing so is just to compare the letters of both strings, which has a time complexity of $O(\min(n_1, n_2))$ if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the sizes of the two strings.
    We want to do better.
    The idea behind the string hashing is the following: we map each string into an integer and compare those instead of the strings.
    Doing this allows us to reduce the execution time of the string comparison to $O(1)$.

    For the conversion, we need a so-called **hash function**.
    The goal of it is to convert a string into an integer, the so-called **hash** of the string.
    The following condition has to hold: if two strings $s$ and $t$ are equal ($s = t$), then also their hashes have to be equal ($\text{hash}(s) = \text{hash}(t)$).
    Otherwise, we will not be able to compare strings.

    Notice, the opposite direction doesn't have to hold.
    If the hashes are equal ($\text{hash}(s) = \text{hash}(t)$), then the strings do not necessarily have to be equal.
    E.g. a valid hash function would be simply $\text{hash}(s) = 0$ for each $s$.
    Now, this is just a stupid example, because this function will be completely useless, but it is a valid hash function.
    The reason why the opposite direction doesn't have to hold, is because there are exponentially many strings.
    If we only want this hash function to distinguish between all strings consisting of lowercase characters of length smaller than 15, then already the hash wouldn't fit into a 64-bit integer (e.g. unsigned long long) any more, because there are so many of them.
    And of course, we don't want to compare arbitrary long integers, because this will also have the complexity $O(n)$.

    So usually we want the hash function to map strings onto numbers of a fixed range $[0, m)$, then comparing strings is just a comparison of two integers with a fixed length.
    And of course, we want $\text{hash}(s) \neq \text{hash}(t)$ to be very likely if $s \neq t$.

    That's the important part that you have to keep in mind.
    Using hashing will not be 100% deterministically correct, because two complete different strings might have the same hash (the hashes collide).
    However, in a wide majority of tasks, this can be safely ignored as the probability of the hashes of two different strings colliding is still very small.
    And we will discuss some techniques in this article how to keep the probability of collisions very low.

    ## Calculation of the hash of a string

    The good and widely used way to define the hash of a string $s$ of length $n$ is

    $$\begin{align}
    \text{hash}(s) &= s[0] + s[1] \cdot p + s[2] \cdot p^2 + ... + s[n-1] \cdot p^{n-1} \mod m \\
    &= \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s[i] \cdot p^i \mod m,
    \end{align}$$

    where $p$ and $m$ are some chosen, positive numbers.
    It is called a **polynomial rolling hash function**.

    It is reasonable to make $p$ a prime number roughly equal to the number of characters in the input alphabet.
    For example, if the input is composed of only lowercase letters of the English alphabet, $p = 31$ is a good choice.
    If the input may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, then $p = 53$ is a possible choice.
    The code in this article will use $p = 31$.

    Obviously $m$ should be a large number since the probability of two random strings colliding is about $\approx \frac{1}{m}$.
    Sometimes $m = 2^{64}$ is chosen, since then the integer overflows of 64-bit integers work exactly like the modulo operation.
    However, there exists a method, which generates colliding strings (which work independently from the choice of $p$).
    So in practice, $m = 2^{64}$ is not recommended.
    A good choice for $m$ is some large prime number.
    The code in this article will just use $m = 10^9+9$.
    This is a large number, but still small enough so that we can perform multiplication of two values using 64-bit integers.

    Here is an example of calculating the hash of a string $s$, which contains only lowercase letters.
    We convert each character of $s$ to an integer.
    Here we use the conversion $a \rightarrow 1$, $b \rightarrow 2$, $\dots$, $z \rightarrow 26$.
    Converting $a \rightarrow 0$ is not a good idea, because then the hashes of the strings $a$, $aa$, $aaa$, $\dots$ all evaluate to $0$.

    ```{.cpp file=hashing_function}
    long long compute_hash(string const& s) {
        const int p = 31;
        const int m = 1e9 + 9;
        long long hash_value = 0;
        long long p_pow = 1;
        for (char c : s) {
            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;
            p_pow = (p_pow * p) % m;
        }
        return hash_value;
    }
    ```

    Precomputing the powers of $p$ might give a performance boost.

    ## Example tasks

    ### Search for duplicate strings in an array of strings

    Problem: Given a list of $n$ strings $s_i$, each no longer than $m$ characters, find all the duplicate strings and divide them into groups.

    From the obvious algorithm involving sorting the strings, we would get a time complexity of $O(n m \log n)$ where the sorting requires $O(n \log n)$ comparisons and each comparison take $O(m)$ time.
    However, by using hashes, we reduce the comparison time to $O(1)$, giving us an algorithm that runs in $O(n m + n \log n)$ time.

    We calculate the hash for each string, sort the hashes together with the indices, and then group the indices by identical hashes.

    ```{.cpp file=hashing_group_identical_strings}
    vector<vector<int>> group_identical_strings(vector<string> const& s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<pair<long long, int>> hashes(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            hashes[i] = {compute_hash(s[i]), i};

        sort(hashes.begin(), hashes.end());

        vector<vector<int>> groups;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i == 0 || hashes[i].first != hashes[i-1].first)
                groups.emplace_back();
            groups.back().push_back(hashes[i].second);
        }
        return groups;
    }

    Part: 1/1
    \chapter{String algorithms}

    This chapter deals with efficient algorithms
    for string processing.
    Many string problems can be easily solved
    in $O(n^2)$ time, but the challenge is to
    find algorithms that work in $O(n)$ or $O(n \log n)$
    time.

    \index{pattern matching}

    For example, a fundamental string processing
    problem is the \key{pattern matching} problem:
    given a string of length $n$ and a pattern of length $m$,
    our task is to find the occurrences of the pattern
    in the string.
    For example, the pattern \texttt{ABC} occurs two
    times in the string \texttt{ABABCBABC}.

    The pattern matching problem can be easily solved
    in $O(nm)$ time by a brute force algorithm that
    tests all positions where the pattern may
    occur in the string.
    However, in this chapter, we will see that there
    are more efficient algorithms that require only
    $O(n+m)$ time.

    \index{string}

    \section{String terminology}

    \index{alphabet}

    Throughout the chapter, we assume that
    zero-based indexing is used in strings.
    Thus, a string \texttt{s} of length $n$
    consists of characters
    $\texttt{s}[0],\texttt{s}[1],\ldots,\texttt{s}[n-1]$.
    The set of characters that may appear
    in strings is called an \key{alphabet}.
    For example, the alphabet
    $\{\texttt{A},\texttt{B},\ldots,\texttt{Z}\}$
    consists of the capital letters of English.

    \index{substring}

    A \key{substring} is a sequence of consecutive
    characters in a string.
    We use the notation $\texttt{s}[a \ldots b]$
    to refer to a substring of \texttt{s}
    that begins at position $a$ and ends at position $b$.
    A string of length $n$ has $n(n+1)/2$ substrings.
    For example, the substrings of
    \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}, \texttt{D},
    \texttt{AB}, \texttt{BC}, \texttt{CD},
    \texttt{ABC}, \texttt{BCD} and \texttt{ABCD}.

    \index{subsequence}

    A \key{subsequence} is a sequence of
    (not necessarily consecutive) characters
    in a string in their original order.
    A string of length $n$ has $2^n-1$ subsequences.
    For example, the subsequences of
    \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}, \texttt{D},
    \texttt{AB}, \texttt{AC}, \texttt{AD},
    \texttt{BC}, \texttt{BD}, \texttt{CD},
    \texttt{ABC}, \texttt{ABD}, \texttt{ACD},
    \texttt{BCD} and \texttt{ABCD}.

    \index{prefix}
    \index{suffix}

    A \key{prefix} is a substring that starts at the beginning
    of a string,
    and a \key{suffix} is a substring that ends at the end
    of a string.
    For example,
    the prefixes of \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{A}, \texttt{AB}, \texttt{ABC} and \texttt{ABCD},
    and the suffixes of \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{D}, \texttt{CD}, \texttt{BCD} and \texttt{ABCD}.

    \index{rotation}

    A \key{rotation} can be generated by moving
    the characters of a string one by one from the beginning
    to the end (or vice versa).
    For example, the rotations of \texttt{ABCD} are
    \texttt{ABCD}, \texttt{BCDA}, \texttt{CDAB} and \texttt{DABC}.

    \index{period}

    A \key{period} is a prefix of a string such that
    the string can be constructed by repeating the period.
    The last repetition may be partial and contain
    only a prefix of the period.
    For example, the shortest period of
    \texttt{ABCABCA} is \texttt{ABC}.

    \index{border}

    A \key{border} is a string that is both
    a prefix and a suffix of a string.
    For example, the borders of \texttt{ABACABA}
    are \texttt{A}, \texttt{ABA} and \texttt{ABACABA}.

    \index{lexicographical order}

    Strings are compared using the \key{lexicographical order}
    (which corresponds to the alphabetical order).
    It means that $x<y$ if either $x \neq y$ and $x$ is a prefix of $y$,
    or there is a position $k$ such that
    $x[i]=y[i]$ when $i<k$ and $x[k]<y[k]$.

    Title: Z-function and its calculation
    Part: 1/2
    # Z-function and its calculation

    Suppose we are given a string $s$ of length $n$. The **Z-function** for this string is an array of length $n$ where the $i$-th element is equal to the greatest number of characters starting from the position $i$ that coincide with the first characters of $s$.

    In other words, $z[i]$ is the length of the longest string that is, at the same time, a prefix of $s$ and a prefix of the suffix of $s$ starting at $i$.

    **Note.** In this article, to avoid ambiguity, we assume $0$-based indexes; that is: the first character of $s$ has index $0$ and the last one has index $n-1$.

    The first element of Z-function, $z[0]$, is generally not well defined. In this article we will assume it is zero (although it doesn't change anything in the algorithm implementation).

    This article presents an algorithm for calculating the Z-function in $O(n)$ time, as well as various of its applications.

    ## Examples

    For example, here are the values of the Z-function computed for different strings:

    * "aaaaa" - $[0, 4, 3, 2, 1]$
    * "aaabaab" - $[0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]$
    * "abacaba" - $[0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1]$

    ## Trivial algorithm

    Formal definition can be represented in the following elementary $O(n^2)$ implementation.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> z_function_trivial(string s) {
    	int n = s.size();
    	vector<int> z(n);
    	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    		while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {
    			z[i]++;
    		}
    	}
    	return z;
    }
    ```

    We just iterate through every position $i$ and update $z[i]$ for each one of them, starting from $z[i] = 0$ and incrementing it as long as we don't find a mismatch (and as long as we don't reach the end of the line).

    Of course, this is not an efficient implementation. We will now show the construction of an efficient implementation.

    ## Efficient algorithm to compute the Z-function

    To obtain an efficient algorithm we will compute the values of $z[i]$ in turn from $i = 1$ to $n - 1$ but at the same time, when computing a new value, we'll try to make the best use possible of the previously computed values.

    For the sake of brevity, let's call **segment matches** those substrings that coincide with a prefix of $s$. For example, the value of the desired Z-function $z[i]$ is the length of the segment match starting at position $i$ (and that ends at position $i + z[i] - 1$).

    To do this, we will keep **the $[l, r)$ indices of the rightmost segment match**. That is, among all detected segments we will keep the one that ends rightmost. In a way, the index $r$ can be seen as the "boundary" to which our string $s$ has been scanned by the algorithm; everything beyond that point is not yet known.

    Then, if the current index (for which we have to compute the next value of the Z-function) is $i$, we have one of two options:

    *   $i \geq r$ -- the current position is **outside** of what we have already processed.

        We will then compute $z[i]$ with the **trivial algorithm** (that is, just comparing values one by one). Note that in the end, if $z[i] > 0$, we'll have to update the indices of the rightmost segment, because it's guaranteed that the new $r = i + z[i]$ is better than the previous $r$.

    *   $i < r$ -- the current position is inside the current segment match $[l, r)$.

        Then we can use the already calculated Z-values to "initialize" the value of $z[i]$ to something (it sure is better than "starting from zero"), maybe even some big number.

        For this, we observe that the substrings $s[l \dots r)$ and $s[0 \dots r-l)$ **match**. This means that as an initial approximation for $z[i]$ we can take the value already computed for the corresponding segment $s[0 \dots r-l)$, and that is $z[i-l]$.

        However, the value $z[i-l]$ could be too large: when applied to position $i$ it could exceed the index $r$. This is not allowed because we know nothing about the characters to the right of $r$: they may differ from those required.

        Here is **an example** of a similar scenario:

        $$ s = "aaaabaa" $$

        When we get to the last position ($i = 6$), the current match segment will be $[5, 7)$. Position $6$ will then match position $6 - 5 = 1$, for which the value of the Z-function is $z[1] = 3$. Obviously, we cannot initialize $z[6]$ to $3$, it would be completely incorrect. The maximum value we could initialize it to is $1$ -- because it's the largest value that doesn't bring us beyond the index $r$ of the match segment $[l, r)$.

        Thus, as an **initial approximation** for $z[i]$ we can safely take:

        $$ z_0[i] = \min(r - i,\; z[i-l]) $$

        After having $z[i]$ initialized to $z_0[i]$, we try to increment $z[i]$ by running the **trivial algorithm** -- because in general, after the border $r$, we cannot know if the segment will continue to match or not.

    Thus, the whole algorithm is split in two cases, which differ only in **the initial value** of $z[i]$: in the first case it's assumed to be zero, in the second case it is determined by the previously computed values (using the above formula). After that, both branches of this algorithm can be reduced to the implementation of **the trivial algorithm**, which starts immediately after we specify the initial value.

    The algorithm turns out to be very simple. Despite the fact that on each iteration the trivial algorithm is run, we have made significant progress, having an algorithm that runs in linear time. Later on we will prove that the running time is linear.

    ## Implementation

    Implementation turns out to be rather concise:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> z_function(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> z(n);
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if(i < r) {
                z[i] = min(r - i, z[i - l]);
            }
            while(i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {
                z[i]++;
            }
            if(i + z[i] > r) {
                l = i;
                r = i + z[i];
            }
        }
        return z;
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/118 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. The strings in the list should be the result of splitting the input string at each space character.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and look for spaces. Whenever we find a space, we can take the substring from the last space (or the start of the string) to the current position and add it to a list. After reaching the end of the string, we should also add the last substring (if any) to the list. Finally, we return the list of substrings.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function string_to_list(input_string):
       initialize an empty list called result
       initialize a variable start_index to 0
       
       for each character index i in input_string:
           if input_string[i] is a space:
               if start_index is not equal to i:
                   add the substring from start_index to i to result

INFO - raw_msg:
 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of strings. The strings in the list should be the result of splitting the input string at each space character.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string and look for spaces. Whenever we find a space, we can take the substring from the last space (or the start of the string) to the current position and add it to a list. After reaching the end of the string, we should also add the last substring (if any) to the list. Finally, we return the list of substrings.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function string_to_list(input_string):
       initialize an empty list called result
       initialize a variable start_index to 0
       
       for each character index i in input_string:
           if input_string[i] is a space:
               if start_index is not equal to i:
                   add the substring from start_index to i to result
               set start_index to i + 1
       
       if start_index is less than the length of input_string:
           add the substring from start_index to the end of input_string to result
       
       return result
