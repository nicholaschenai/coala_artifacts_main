    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that counts how many characters in a given string are in the same position as they are in the English alphabet, ignoring case differences. For example, if the character 'a' is in the first position of the string, it counts as a match.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character of the string and compare its position (1-based index) to its corresponding position in the alphabet. We can convert both the character and its position to a common format (lowercase) to ensure case insensitivity. If they match, we increment a counter. Finally, we return the counter.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function count_char_position(s):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for i from 0 to length of s - 1:\n           character = lowercase of s[i]\n           position = i + 1  // converting to 1-based index\n           if character is between 'a' and 'z':\n               if position matches (ord(character) - ord('a') + 1):\n                   increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef count_char_position(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter for matching characters\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Convert character to lowercase\n        character = s[i].lower()\n        # Calculate the position (1-based index)\n        position = i + 1\n        \n        # Check if the character is a lowercase letter\n        if 'a' <= character <= 'z':\n            # Check if the position matches the character's position in the alphabet\n            if position == (ord(character) - ord('a') + 1):\n                count += 1  # Increment the count if there's a match\n    \n    return count  # Return the total count of matches\n```",
