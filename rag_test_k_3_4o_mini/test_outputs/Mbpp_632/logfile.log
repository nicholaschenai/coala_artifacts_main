INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/632 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and moves all the zeros in that list to the end, while keeping the order of the non-zero elements the same.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   We can iterate through the list and collect all non-zero elements in a new list. After that, we can count how many zeros were in the original list and append that many zeros to the end of the new list. This way, we maintain the order of non-zero elements and move all zeros to the end.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function move_zero(input_list):
       create an empty list called non_zero_elements
       initialize a zero_count variable to 0
       
       for each element in input_list:
           if element is not zero:
               append element to non_zero_elements
           else:

    Title: Finding the largest zero submatrix
    Part: 1/1
    # Finding the largest zero submatrix

    You are given a matrix with `n` rows and `m` columns. Find the largest submatrix consisting of only zeros (a submatrix is a rectangular area of the matrix).

    ## Algorithm

    Elements of the matrix will be `a[i][j]`, where `i = 0...n - 1`, `j = 0... m - 1`. For simplicity, we will consider all non-zero elements equal to 1.

    ### Step 1: Auxiliary dynamic

    First, we calculate the following auxiliary matrix: `d[i][j]`, nearest row that has a 1 above `a[i][j]`. Formally speaking, `d[i][j]` is the largest row number (from `0` to `i - 1`), in which there is a element equal to `1` in the `j`-th column. 
    While iterating from top-left to bottom-right, when we stand in row `i`, we know the values from the previous row, so, it is enough to update just the elements with value `1`. We can save the values in a simple array `d[i]`, `i = 1...m - 1`, because in the further algorithm we will process the matrix one row at a time and only need the values of the current row.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> d(m, -1);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
            if (a[i][j] == 1) {
                d[j] = i;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Step 2: Problem solving

    We can solve the problem in $O(n m^2)$ iterating through rows, considering every possible left and right columns for a submatrix. The bottom of the rectangle will be the current row, and using `d[i][j]` we can find the top row. However, it is possible to go further and significantly improve the complexity of the solution.

    It is clear that the desired zero submatrix is bounded on all four sides by some ones, which prevent it from increasing in size and improving the answer. Therefore,  we will not miss the answer if we act as follows: for every cell `j` in row `i` (the bottom row of a potential zero submatrix) we will have `d[i][j]` as the top row of the current zero submatrix. It now remains to determine the optimal left and right boundaries of the zero submatrix, i.e. maximally push this submatrix to the left and right of the `j`-th column. 

    What does it mean to push the maximum to the left? It means to find an index `k1` for which `d[i][k1] > d[i][j]`, and at the same time `k1` - the closest one to the left of the index `j`. It is clear that then `k1 + 1` gives the number of the left column of the required zero submatrix. If there is no such index at all, then put `k1` = `-1`(this means that we were able to extend the current zero submatrix to the left all the way to the border of matrix `a`).

    Symmetrically, you can define an index `k2` for the right border: this is the closest index to the right of `j` such that `d[i][k2] > d[i][j]` (or `m`, if there is no such index).

    So, the indices `k1` and `k2`, if we learn to search for them effectively, will give us all the necessary information about the current zero submatrix. In particular, its area will be equal to `(i - d[i][j]) * (k2 - k1 - 1)`.

    How to look for these indexes `k1` and `k2` effectively with fixed `i` and `j`? We can do that in $O(1)$ on average.

    To achieve such complexity, you can use the stack as follows. Let's first learn how to search for an index `k1`, and save its value for each index `j` within the current row `i` in matrix `d1[i][j]`. To do this, we will look through all the columns `j` from left to right, and we will store in the stack only those columns that have `d[][]` strictly greater than `d[i][j]`. It is clear that when moving from a column `j` to the next column, it is necessary to update the content of the stack. When there is an inappropriate element at the top of the stack (i.e. `d[][] <= d[i][j]`) pop it. It is easy to understand that it is enough to remove from the stack only from its top, and from none of its other places (because the stack will contain an increasing `d` sequence of columns).

    The value `d1[i][j]` for each `j` will be equal to the value lying at that moment on top of the stack.

    The dynamics `d2[i][j]` for finding the indices `k2` is considered similar, only you need to view the columns from right to left.

    It is clear that since there are exactly `m` pieces added to the stack on each line, there could not be more deletions either, the sum of complexities will be linear, so the final complexity of the algorithm is $O(nm)$.

    It should also be noted that this algorithm consumes $O(m)$ memory (not counting the input data - the matrix `a[][]`).

    ### Implementation

    ```cpp
    int zero_matrix(vector<vector<int>> a) {
        int n = a.size();
        int m = a[0].size();

        int ans = 0;
        vector<int> d(m, -1), d1(m), d2(m);
        stack<int> st;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
                if (a[i][j] == 1)
                    d[j] = i;
            }

            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
                while (!st.empty() && d[st.top()] <= d[j])
                    st.pop();
                d1[j] = st.empty() ? -1 : st.top();
                st.push(j);
            }
            while (!st.empty())
                st.pop();

            for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
                while (!st.empty() && d[st.top()] <= d[j])
                    st.pop();
                d2[j] = st.empty() ? m : st.top();
                st.push(j);
            }
            while (!st.empty())
                st.pop();

            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j)
                ans = max(ans, (i - d[j]) * (d2[j] - d1[j] - 1));
        }
        return ans;

    Part: 2/2
    ```

    ### Comments on this implementation

    The whole solution is given as a function which returns an array of length $n$ -- the Z-function of $s$.

    Array $z$ is initially filled with zeros. The current rightmost match segment is assumed to be $[0; 0)$ (that is, a deliberately small segment which doesn't contain any $i$).

    Inside the loop for $i = 1 \dots n - 1$ we first determine the initial value $z[i]$ -- it will either remain zero or be computed using the above formula.

    Thereafter, the trivial algorithm attempts to increase the value of $z[i]$ as much as possible.

    In the end, if it's required (that is, if $i + z[i] > r$), we update the rightmost match segment $[l, r)$.

    ## Asymptotic behavior of the algorithm

    We will prove that the above algorithm has a running time that is linear in the length of the string -- thus, it's $O(n)$.

    The proof is very simple.

    We are interested in the nested `while` loop, since everything else is just a bunch of constant operations which sums up to $O(n)$.

    We will show that **each iteration** of the `while` loop will increase the right border $r$ of the match segment.

    To do that, we will consider both branches of the algorithm:

    *   $i \geq r$

        In this case, either the `while` loop won't make any iteration (if $s[0] \ne s[i]$), or it will take a few iterations, starting at position $i$, each time moving one character to the right. After that, the right border $r$ will necessarily be updated.

        So we have found that, when $i \geq r$, each iteration of the `while` loop increases the value of the new $r$ index.

    *   $i < r$

        In this case, we initialize $z[i]$ to a certain value $z_0$ given by the above formula. Let's compare this initial value $z_0$ to the value $r - i$. We will have three cases:

          *   $z_0 < r - i$

              We prove that in this case no iteration of the `while` loop will take place.

              It's easy to prove, for example, by contradiction: if the `while` loop made at least one iteration, it would mean that initial approximation $z[i] = z_0$ was inaccurate (less than the match's actual length). But since $s[l \dots r)$ and $s[0 \dots r-l)$ are the same, this would imply that $z[i-l]$ holds the wrong value (less than it should be).

              Thus, since $z[i-l]$ is correct and it is less than $r - i$, it follows that this value coincides with the required value $z[i]$.

          *   $z_0 = r - i$

              In this case, the `while` loop can make a few iterations, but each of them will lead to an increase in the value of the $r$ index because we will start comparing from $s[r]$, which will climb beyond the $[l, r)$ interval.

          *   $z_0 > r - i$

              This option is impossible, by definition of $z_0$.

    So, we have proved that each iteration of the inner loop make the $r$ pointer advance to the right. Since $r$ can't be more than $n-1$, this means that the inner loop won't make more than $n-1$ iterations.

    As the rest of the algorithm obviously works in $O(n)$, we have proved that the whole algorithm for computing Z-functions runs in linear time.

    ## Applications

    We will now consider some uses of Z-functions for specific tasks.

    These applications will be largely similar to applications of [prefix function](prefix-function.md).

    ### Search the substring

    To avoid confusion, we call $t$ the **string of text**, and $p$ the **pattern**. The problem is: find all occurrences of the pattern $p$ inside the text $t$.

    To solve this problem, we create a new string $s = p + \diamond + t$, that is, we apply string concatenation to $p$ and $t$ but we also put a separator character $\diamond$ in the middle (we'll choose $\diamond$ so that it will certainly not be present anywhere in the strings $p$ or $t$).

    Compute the Z-function for $s$. Then, for any $i$ in the interval $[0; \; \operatorname{length}(t) - 1]$, we will consider the corresponding value $k = z[i + \operatorname{length}(p) + 1]$. If $k$ is equal to $\operatorname{length}(p)$ then we know there is one occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$, otherwise there is no occurrence of $p$ in the $i$-th position of $t$.

    The running time (and memory consumption) is $O(\operatorname{length}(t) + \operatorname{length}(p))$.

    ### Number of distinct substrings in a string

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$, count the number of distinct substrings of $s$.

    We'll solve this problem iteratively. That is: knowing the current number of different substrings, recalculate this amount after adding to the end of $s$ one character.

    So, let $k$ be the current number of distinct substrings of $s$. We append a new character $c$ to $s$. Obviously, there can be some new substrings ending in this new character $c$ (namely, all those strings that end with this symbol and that we haven't encountered yet).

    Take a string $t = s + c$ and invert it (write its characters in reverse order). Our task is now to count how many prefixes of $t$ are not found anywhere else in $t$. Let's compute the Z-function of $t$ and find its maximum value $z_{max}$. Obviously, $t$'s prefix of length $z_{max}$ occurs also somewhere in the middle of $t$. Clearly, shorter prefixes also occur.

    So, we have found that the number of new substrings that appear when symbol $c$ is appended to $s$ is equal to $\operatorname{length}(t) - z_{max}$.

    Consequently, the running time of this solution is $O(n^2)$ for a string of length $n$.

    It's worth noting that in exactly the same way we can recalculate, still in $O(n)$ time, the number of distinct substrings when appending a character in the beginning of the string, as well as when removing it (from the end or the beginning).

    ### String compression

    Given a string $s$ of length $n$. Find its shortest "compressed" representation, that is: find a string $t$ of shortest length such that $s$ can be represented as a concatenation of one or more copies of $t$.

    A solution is: compute the Z-function of $s$, loop through all $i$ such that $i$ divides $n$. Stop at the first $i$ such that $i + z[i] = n$. Then, the string $s$ can be compressed to the length $i$.

    The proof for this fact is the same as the solution which uses the [prefix function](prefix-function.md).
[/Textbook Reference Material]


[Textbook Reference Material]:
    Title: Z-function and its calculation
    Part: 1/2
    # Z-function and its calculation

    Suppose we are given a string $s$ of length $n$. The **Z-function** for this string is an array of length $n$ where the $i$-th element is equal to the greatest number of characters starting from the position $i$ that coincide with the first characters of $s$.

    In other words, $z[i]$ is the length of the longest string that is, at the same time, a prefix of $s$ and a prefix of the suffix of $s$ starting at $i$.

    **Note.** In this article, to avoid ambiguity, we assume $0$-based indexes; that is: the first character of $s$ has index $0$ and the last one has index $n-1$.

    The first element of Z-function, $z[0]$, is generally not well defined. In this article we will assume it is zero (although it doesn't change anything in the algorithm implementation).

    This article presents an algorithm for calculating the Z-function in $O(n)$ time, as well as various of its applications.

    ## Examples

    For example, here are the values of the Z-function computed for different strings:

    * "aaaaa" - $[0, 4, 3, 2, 1]$
    * "aaabaab" - $[0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0]$
    * "abacaba" - $[0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1]$

    ## Trivial algorithm

    Formal definition can be represented in the following elementary $O(n^2)$ implementation.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> z_function_trivial(string s) {
    	int n = s.size();
    	vector<int> z(n);
    	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    		while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {
    			z[i]++;
    		}
    	}
    	return z;
    }
    ```

    We just iterate through every position $i$ and update $z[i]$ for each one of them, starting from $z[i] = 0$ and incrementing it as long as we don't find a mismatch (and as long as we don't reach the end of the line).

    Of course, this is not an efficient implementation. We will now show the construction of an efficient implementation.

    ## Efficient algorithm to compute the Z-function

    To obtain an efficient algorithm we will compute the values of $z[i]$ in turn from $i = 1$ to $n - 1$ but at the same time, when computing a new value, we'll try to make the best use possible of the previously computed values.

    For the sake of brevity, let's call **segment matches** those substrings that coincide with a prefix of $s$. For example, the value of the desired Z-function $z[i]$ is the length of the segment match starting at position $i$ (and that ends at position $i + z[i] - 1$).

    To do this, we will keep **the $[l, r)$ indices of the rightmost segment match**. That is, among all detected segments we will keep the one that ends rightmost. In a way, the index $r$ can be seen as the "boundary" to which our string $s$ has been scanned by the algorithm; everything beyond that point is not yet known.

    Then, if the current index (for which we have to compute the next value of the Z-function) is $i$, we have one of two options:

    *   $i \geq r$ -- the current position is **outside** of what we have already processed.

        We will then compute $z[i]$ with the **trivial algorithm** (that is, just comparing values one by one). Note that in the end, if $z[i] > 0$, we'll have to update the indices of the rightmost segment, because it's guaranteed that the new $r = i + z[i]$ is better than the previous $r$.

    *   $i < r$ -- the current position is inside the current segment match $[l, r)$.

        Then we can use the already calculated Z-values to "initialize" the value of $z[i]$ to something (it sure is better than "starting from zero"), maybe even some big number.

        For this, we observe that the substrings $s[l \dots r)$ and $s[0 \dots r-l)$ **match**. This means that as an initial approximation for $z[i]$ we can take the value already computed for the corresponding segment $s[0 \dots r-l)$, and that is $z[i-l]$.

        However, the value $z[i-l]$ could be too large: when applied to position $i$ it could exceed the index $r$. This is not allowed because we know nothing about the characters to the right of $r$: they may differ from those required.

        Here is **an example** of a similar scenario:

        $$ s = "aaaabaa" $$

        When we get to the last position ($i = 6$), the current match segment will be $[5, 7)$. Position $6$ will then match position $6 - 5 = 1$, for which the value of the Z-function is $z[1] = 3$. Obviously, we cannot initialize $z[6]$ to $3$, it would be completely incorrect. The maximum value we could initialize it to is $1$ -- because it's the largest value that doesn't bring us beyond the index $r$ of the match segment $[l, r)$.

        Thus, as an **initial approximation** for $z[i]$ we can safely take:

        $$ z_0[i] = \min(r - i,\; z[i-l]) $$

        After having $z[i]$ initialized to $z_0[i]$, we try to increment $z[i]$ by running the **trivial algorithm** -- because in general, after the border $r$, we cannot know if the segment will continue to match or not.

    Thus, the whole algorithm is split in two cases, which differ only in **the initial value** of $z[i]$: in the first case it's assumed to be zero, in the second case it is determined by the previously computed values (using the above formula). After that, both branches of this algorithm can be reduced to the implementation of **the trivial algorithm**, which starts immediately after we specify the initial value.

    The algorithm turns out to be very simple. Despite the fact that on each iteration the trivial algorithm is run, we have made significant progress, having an algorithm that runs in linear time. Later on we will prove that the running time is linear.

    ## Implementation

    Implementation turns out to be rather concise:

    ```cpp
    vector<int> z_function(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<int> z(n);
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if(i < r) {
                z[i] = min(r - i, z[i - l]);
            }
            while(i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] == s[i + z[i]]) {
                z[i]++;
            }
            if(i + z[i] > r) {
                l = i;
                r = i + z[i];
            }
        }
        return z;
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/632 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: The task is to create a function that takes a list of integers and moves all occurrences of the number zero to the end of the list while maintaining the order of the non-zero elements.

2. **Conceptualization of a Solution**: 
   - We can iterate through the list and collect all non-zero elements in a new list.
   - After collecting the non-zero elements, we can append the appropriate number of zeros to the end of this new list.
   - Finally, we return the new list which contains all non-zero elements followed by the zeros.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function move_zero(lst):
       create an empty list for non-zero elements
       count the number of zeros
       for each element in lst:
           if the element is not zero:
               add it to the non-zero list
           else:
               increment the zero count
       append the zeros to the non-zero list based on the zero count
       return the non-zero list
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:
```python
def move_zero(lst):
    # Create a list to hold non-zero elements
    non_zero = []
    # Count the number of zeros
    zero_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the original list

        if num != 0:
            # If the number is not zero, add it to the non-zero list

        else:
            # If the number is zero, increment the zero count

    # Extend the non-zero list with the counted zeros
    non_zero.extend([0] * zero_count)
    
    # Return the modified list with zeros at the end
    return non_zero
