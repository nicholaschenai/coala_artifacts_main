In our case some prime factors may appear multiple times in the prime factorization of $n$.\n\n    If a prime factor $p$ appears $e$ times in the prime factorization of $n$, then we can use the factor $p$ up to $e$ times in the subset.\n    Which means we have $e+1$ choices.\n\n    Therefore if the prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers, then the number of divisors is:\n\n    $$d(n) = (e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$$\n\n    A way of thinking about it is the following:\n\n    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then there are obviously $e_1 + 1$ divisors ($1, p_1, p_1^2, \\dots, p_1^{e_1}$).\n\n    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then you can arrange all divisors in form of a tabular.\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n    & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\\hline\n    1 & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    p_1 & p_1 & p_1 \\cdot p_2 & p_1 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    p_1^2 & p_1^2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\\\\\n    p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2 & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    So the number of divisors is trivially $(e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1)$.\n\n    * A similar argument can be made if there are more then two distinct prime factors.\n\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long numberOfDivisors(long long num) {\n        long long total = 1;\n        for (int i = 2;
