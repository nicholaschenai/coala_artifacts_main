INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/389 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci numbers, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, but they start with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To find the n-th Lucas number, we can use a recursive approach or an iterative approach. The base cases are:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   For n greater than 1, the n-th Lucas number can be calculated as:
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)
   We can use a loop to calculate the value iteratively to avoid the overhead of recursion.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_lucas(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 2
       if n == 1:
           return 1
       initialize first = 2
       initialize second = 1
       for i from 2 to n:
           next = first + second
           first = second
           second = next
       return second
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def find_lucas(n):
    # Base case for the 0th Lucas number
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    # Base case for the 1st Lucas number
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first two Lucas numbers
    first = 2  # L(0)
    second = 1  # L(1)

        next = first + second  # L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)
        first = second  # Move to the next number in the sequence
        second = next  # Update the second number to the new calculated value
    
    return second  # Return the n-th Lucas number

    Title: Josephus Problem
    Part: 1/1
    # Josephus Problem

    ## Statement

    We are given the natural numbers $n$ and $k$.
    All natural numbers from $1$ to $n$ are written in a circle. 
    First, count the $k$-th number starting from the first one and delete it.
    Then $k$ numbers are counted starting from the next one and the $k$-th one is removed again, and so on.
    The process stops when one number remains.
    It is required to find the last number.

    This task was set by **Flavius Josephus** in the 1st century (though in a somewhat narrower formulation: for $k = 2$).

    This problem can be solved by modeling the procedure.
    Brute force modeling will work $O(n^{2})$. Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \log n)$.
    We want something better though.

    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution

    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.

    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:

    $$\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
    n\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\
    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\
    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\
    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\
    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\
    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\
    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\
    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\
    \end{array}$$

    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:

    $$J_{n,k} = \left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \bmod n \right) + 1$$

    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$

    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:

    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \bmod n$$

    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.

    ## Implementation

    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;
    }
    ```

    **Non-recursive form** :

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
      	  res = (res + k) % i;
        return res + 1;
    }
    ```

    This formula can also be found analytically.
    Again here we assume 0-indexing.
    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.
    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \bmod n$.
    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \ \bmod n$.

    ## Modeling a $O(k \log n)$ solution

    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.
    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$) in one run without looping over.
    Afterwards we have $n - \lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k)$-th number.
    So we have to shift by that many.
    We can notice that $\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor \cdot k$ is simply $-n \bmod k$.
    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.
    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.

    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.

    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):

    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}
    int josephus(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1)
            return 0;
        if (k == 1)
            return n-1;
        if (k > n)
            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;
        int cnt = n / k;
        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);
        res -= n % k;
        if (res < 0)
            res += n;
        else
            res += res / (k - 1);
        return res;
    }
    ```

    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:

    $$ n \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) ^ x = 1, $$

    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:

    $$\ln n + x \ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) = 0,$$ 
    $$x = - \frac{\ln n}{\ln \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right)},$$

    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:

    $$x \approx k \ln n$$

    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \log n)$.

    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$

    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.

    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):

    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$

    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:

    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$

    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, "restarting" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:

    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \left(n-2^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor} \right)$$

    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$

    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler "The Josephus Problem" and Odlyzko, Wilf "Functional iteration and the Josephus problem").

    Title: Fibonacci Numbers
    Part: 1/1
    # Fibonacci Numbers

    The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

    $$F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

    The first elements of the sequence ([OEIS A000045](http://oeis.org/A000045)) are:

    $$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...$$

    ## Properties

    Fibonacci numbers possess a lot of interesting properties. Here are a few of them:

    * Cassini's identity:
  
    $$F_{n-1} F_{n+1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n$$

    * The "addition" rule:
  
    $$F_{n+k} = F_k F_{n+1} + F_{k-1} F_n$$

    * Applying the previous identity to the case $k = n$, we get:
  
    $$F_{2n} = F_n (F_{n+1} + F_{n-1})$$

    * From this we can prove by induction that for any positive integer $k$,  $F_{nk}$ is multiple of $F_n$.

    * The inverse is also true: if $F_m$ is multiple of $F_n$, then $m$ is multiple of $n$.

    * GCD identity:
  
    $$GCD(F_m, F_n) = F_{GCD(m, n)}$$

    * Fibonacci numbers are the worst possible inputs for Euclidean algorithm (see Lame's theorem in [Euclidean algorithm](euclid-algorithm.md))

    ## Fibonacci Coding

    We can use the sequence to encode positive integers into binary code words. According to Zeckendorf's theorem, any natural number $n$ can be uniquely represented as a sum of Fibonacci numbers:

    $$N = F_{k_1} + F_{k_2} + \ldots + F_{k_r}$$

    such that $k_1 \ge k_2 + 2,\ k_2 \ge k_3 + 2,\  \ldots,\  k_r \ge 2$ (i.e.: the representation cannot use two consecutive Fibonacci numbers).

    It follows that any number can be uniquely encoded in the Fibonacci coding.
    And we can describe this representation with binary codes $d_0 d_1 d_2 \dots d_s 1$, where $d_i$ is $1$ if $F_{i+2}$ is used in the representation.
    The code will be appended by a $1$ do indicate the end of the code word.
    Notice that this is the only occurrence where two consecutive 1-bits appear.

    $$\begin{eqnarray}
    1 &=& 1 &=& F_2 &=& (11)_F \\
    2 &=& 2 &=& F_3 &=& (011)_F \\
    6 &=& 5 + 1 &=& F_5 + F_2 &=& (10011)_F \\
    8 &=& 8 &=& F_6 &=& (000011)_F \\
    9 &=& 8 + 1 &=& F_6 + F_2 &=& (100011)_F \\
    19 &=& 13 + 5 + 1 &=& F_7 + F_5 + F_2 &=& (1001011)_F
    \end{eqnarray}$$

    The encoding of an integer $n$ can be done with a simple greedy algorithm:

    1. Iterate through the Fibonacci numbers from the largest to the smallest until you find one less than or equal to $n$.

    2. Suppose this number was $F_i$. Subtract $F_i$ from $n$ and put a $1$ in the $i-2$ position of the code word (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit).

    3. Repeat until there is no remainder.

    4. Add a final $1$ to the codeword to indicate its end.

    To decode a code word, first remove the final $1$. Then, if the $i$-th bit is set (indexing from 0 from the leftmost to the rightmost bit), sum $F_{i+2}$ to the number.


    ## Formulas for the $n^{\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number { data-toc-label="Formulas for the <script type='math/tex'>n</script>-th Fibonacci number" }

    ### Closed-form expression

    There is a formula known as "Binet's formula", even though it was already known by Moivre:

    $$F_n = \frac{\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n - \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n}{\sqrt{5}}$$

    This formula is easy to prove by induction, but it can be deduced with the help of the concept of generating functions or by solving a functional equation.

    You can immediately notice that the second term's absolute value is always less than $1$, and it also decreases very rapidly (exponentially). Hence the value of the first term alone is "almost" $F_n$. This can be written strictly as: 

    $$F_n = \left[\frac{\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n}{\sqrt{5}}\right]$$

    where the square brackets denote rounding to the nearest integer.

    As these two formulas would require very high accuracy when working with fractional numbers, they are of little use in practical calculations.

    ### Fibonacci in linear time

    The $n$-th Fibonacci number can be easily found in $O(n)$ by computing the numbers one by one up to $n$. However, there are also faster ways, as we will see.

    We can start from an iterative approach, to take advantage of the use of the formula $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, therefore, we will simply precalculate those values in an array. Taking into account the base cases for $F_0$ and $F_1$.

    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_linear}
    int fib(int n) {
        int a = 0;
        int b = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int tmp = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = tmp;
        }
        return a;
    }
    ```

    In this way, we obtain a linear solution, $O(n)$ time, saving all the values prior to $n$ in the sequence.

    ### Matrix form

    It is easy to prove the following relation:

    $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \cr 1 & 0 \cr\end{pmatrix} ^ n = \begin{pmatrix} F_{n+1} & F_{n} \cr F_{n} & F_{n-1} \cr\end{pmatrix}$$

    Thus, in order to find $F_n$ in $O(log  n)$ time, we must raise the matrix to n. (See [Binary exponentiation](binary-exp.md))

    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_matrix}
    struct matrix {
        long long mat[2][2];
        matrix friend operator *(const matrix &a, const matrix &b){
            matrix c;
            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
              for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
                  c.mat[i][j] = 0;
                  for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {
                      c.mat[i][j] += a.mat[i][k] * b.mat[k][j];
                  }
              }
            }
            return c;
        }
    };

    matrix matpow(matrix base, long long n) {
        matrix ans{ {
          {1, 0},
          {0, 1}
        } };
        while (n) {
            if(n&1)
                ans = ans*base;
            base = base*base;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }

    long long fib(int n) {
        matrix base{ {
          {1, 1},
          {1, 0}
        } };
        return matpow(base, n).mat[0][1];
    }
    ```

    ### Fast Doubling Method

    Using expanding the above matrix expression for $n = 2\cdot k$

    $$
    \begin{pmatrix}
    F_{2k+1} & F_{2k}\\
    F_{2k} & F_{2k-1}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1\\
    1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}^{2k}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
    F_{k+1} & F_{k}\\
    F_{k} & F_{k-1}
    \end{pmatrix}
    ^2
    $$

    we can find these simpler equations:

    $$ \begin{align}
    F_{2k+1} &= F_{k+1}^2 + F_{k}^2 \\
    F_{2k} &= F_k(F_{k+1}+F_{k-1}) = F_k (2F_{k+1} - F_{k})\\
    \end{align}.$$

    Thus using above two equations Fibonacci numbers can be calculated easily by the following code:

    ```{.cpp file=fibonacci_doubling}
    pair<int, int> fib (int n) {
        if (n == 0)
            return {0, 1};

        auto p = fib(n >> 1);
        int c = p.first * (2 * p.second - p.first);
        int d = p.first * p.first + p.second * p.second;
        if (n & 1)
            return {d, c + d};
        else
            return {c, d};
    }
    ```
    The above code returns $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ as a pair.

    ## Periodicity modulo p

    Consider the Fibonacci sequence modulo $p$. We will prove the sequence is periodic.

    Let us prove this by contradiction. Consider the first $p^2 + 1$ pairs of Fibonacci numbers taken modulo $p$:

    $$(F_0,\ F_1),\ (F_1,\ F_2),\ \ldots,\ (F_{p^2},\ F_{p^2 + 1})$$

    There can only be $p$ different remainders modulo $p$, and at most $p^2$ different pairs of remainders, so there are at least two identical pairs among them. This is sufficient to prove the sequence is periodic, as a Fibonacci number is only determined by it's two predecessors. Hence if two pairs of consecutive numbers repeat, that would also mean the numbers after the pair will repeat in the same fashion.

    We now choose two pairs of identical remainders with the smallest indices in the sequence. Let the pairs be $(F_a,\ F_{a + 1})$ and $(F_b,\ F_{b + 1})$. We will prove that $a = 0$. If this was false, there would be two previous pairs $(F_{a-1},\ F_a)$ and $(F_{b-1},\ F_b)$, which, by the property of Fibonacci numbers, would also be equal. However, this contradicts the fact that we had chosen pairs with the smallest indices, completing our proof that there is no pre-period (i.e the numbers are periodic starting from $F_0$).

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/389 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: The task is to create a function that calculates the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci numbers, where the first two numbers are 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: To find the n-th Lucas number, we can use a simple iterative approach. We start with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1) and then repeatedly calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the two previous numbers until we reach the n-th number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function find_lucas(n):
       if n == 0:
           return 2
       if n == 1:
           return 1
       a = 2  // L_0
       b = 1  // L_1
       for i from 2 to n:
           c = a + b  // L_n = L_(n-1) + L_(n-2)
           a = b
           b = c
       return b
   ```
