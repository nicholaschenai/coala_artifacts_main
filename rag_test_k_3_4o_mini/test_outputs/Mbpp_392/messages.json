Bentley's\n    book \\emph{Programming Pearls} \\cite{ben86} made the problem popular.}.\n    The problem is interesting when there may be\n    negative values in the array.\n    For example, in the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    \\begin{samepage}\n    the following subarray produces the maximum sum $10$:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (6,1);\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    \\end{samepage}\n\n    We assume that an empty subarray is allowed,\n    so the maximum subarray sum is always at least $0$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    A straightforward way to solve the problem\n    is to go through all possible subarrays,\n    calculate the sum of values in each subarray and maintain\n    the maximum sum.\n    The following code implements this algorithm:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int best = 0;\n    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {\n        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {\n            int sum = 0;\n            for (int k = a; k <= b; k++) {\n                sum += array[k];\n            }\n            best = max(best,sum);\n        }\n    }\n    cout << best << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The variables \\texttt{a} and \\texttt{b} fix the first and\n    last index of the subarray,\n    and the sum of values is calculated to the variable \\texttt{sum}.\n    The variable \\texttt{best} contains the maximum sum found during the search.\n\n    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^3)$,\n    because it consists of three nested loops \n    that go through the input.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    It is easy to make Algorithm 1 more efficient\n    by removing one loop from it.\n    This is possible by calculating the sum at the same\n    time when the right end of the subarray moves.\n    The result is the following code:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int best = 0;\n    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {\n        int sum = 0;\n        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {\n            sum += array[b];\n            best = max(best,sum);\n        }\n    }\n    cout << best << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n    After this change, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 3}\n\n    Surprisingly, it is possible to solve the problem\n    in $O(n)$ time\\footnote{In \\cite{ben86}, this linear-time algorithm\n    is attributed to J. B. Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes\n    called \\index{Kadane's algorithm} \\key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means\n    that just one loop is enough.\n    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,\n    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.\n    After this, the answer for the problem is the\n    maximum of those sums.\n\n    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray\n    that ends at position $k$.\n    There are two possibilities:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.\n    \\item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends\n    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    In the latter case, since we want to\n    find a subarray with maximum sum,\n    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$\n    should also have the maximum sum.\n    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently\n    by calculating the maximum subarray sum\n    for each ending position from left to right.\n\n    The following code implements the algorithm:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int best = 0, sum = 0;\n    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {\n        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);\n        best = max(best,sum);\n    }\n    cout << best << \"\\n\";\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The algorithm only contains one loop\n    that goes through the input,\n    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.\n    This is also the best possible time complexity,\n    because any algorithm for the problem\n    has to examine all array elements at least once.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    It is interesting to study how efficient \n    algorithms are in practice.\n    The following table shows the running times\n    of the above algorithms for different\n    values of $n$ on a modern computer.\n\n    In each test, the input was generated randomly.\n    The time needed for reading the input was not\n    measured.\n\n    \\begin{center}\n

differences in the running times of the algorithms.\n    Algorithm 1 becomes slow\n    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2\n    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.\n    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process\n    even the largest inputs instantly.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Dynamic programming\n    Section: Coin problem\n    Part: 1/2\n    \\chapter{Dynamic programming}\n\n    \\index{dynamic programming}\n\n    \\key{Dynamic programming}\n    is a technique that combines the correctness\n    of complete search and the efficiency\n    of greedy algorithms.\n    Dynamic programming can be applied if the\n    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems\n    that can be solved independently.\n\n    There are two uses for dynamic programming:\n\n    \\begin{itemize}\n    \\item\n    \\key{Finding an optimal solution}:\n    We want to find a solution that is\n    as large as possible or as small as possible.\n    \\item\n    \\key{Counting the number of solutions}:\n    We want to calculate the total number of\n    possible solutions.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    We will first see how dynamic programming can\n    be used to find an optimal solution,\n    and then we will use the same idea for\n    counting the solutions.\n\n    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone\n    in every competitive programmer's career.\n    While the basic idea is simple,\n    the challenge is how to apply\n    dynamic programming to different problems.\n    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems\n    that are a good starting point.\n\n    \\section{Coin problem}\n\n    We first focus on a problem that we\n    have already seen in Chapter 6:\n    Given a set of coin values $\\texttt{coins} = \\{c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_k\\}$\n    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to\n    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.\n\n    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a\n    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest\n    possible coin.\n    The greedy algorithm works, for example,\n    when the coins are the euro coins,\n    but in the general case the greedy algorithm\n    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.\n\n    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently\n    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm\n    works for any coin set.\n    The dynamic programming\n    algorithm is based on a recursive function\n    that goes through all possibilities how to\n    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.\n    However, the dynamic programming\n    algorithm is efficient because\n    it uses \\emph{memoization} and\n    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Recursive formulation}\n\n    The idea in dynamic programming is to\n    formulate the problem recursively so\n    that the solution to the problem can be\n    calculated from solutions to smaller\n    subproblems.\n    In the coin problem, a natural recursive\n    problem is as follows:\n    what is the smallest number of coins\n    required to form a sum $x$?\n\n    Let $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    denote the minimum\n    number of coins required for a sum $x$.\n    The values of the function depend on the\n    values of the coins.\n    For example, if $\\texttt{coins} = \\{1,3,4\\}$,\n    the first values of the function are as follows:\n\n    \\[\n    \\begin{array}{lcl}\n    \\texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    \\]\n\n    For example, $\\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,\n    because at least 3 coins are needed\n    to form the sum 10.\n    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.\n\n    The essential property of $\\texttt{solve}$ is\n    that its values can be\n    recursively calculated from its smaller values.\n    The idea is to focus on the \\emph{first}\n    coin that we choose for the sum.\n    For example, in the above scenario,\n    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.\n    If we first choose coin 1,\n    the remaining task is to form the sum 9\n    using the minimum number of coins,\n    which is a subproblem of the original problem.\n    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.\n    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula\n    to calculate the minimum number of coins:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\min( & \\texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\\\\n                               & \\texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).\n    \\end{split}\n    \\end{equation*}\n    The base case of the recursion is $\\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    For example,\n    \\[ \\texttt{solve}(10) = \\texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \\texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \\texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\\]\n\n    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function\n    that calculates the minimum number of\n    coins needed to form a sum $x$:\n    \\begin{equation*}\n        \\texttt{solve}(x) = \\begin{cases}\n                   \\infty               & x < 0\\\\\n                   0               & x = 0\\\\\n                   \\min_{c \\in \\texttt{coins}} \\texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\\\\n               \\end{cases}\n    \\end{equation*}\n\n    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\\infty$,\n    because it is impossible to form a negative\n    sum of money.\n    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,\n    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.\n    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through\n    all possibilities how to choose the first coin\n    of the sum.\n\n    Once a recursive function that solves the problem\n    has been found,\n    we can directly implement a solution in C++\n    (the constant \\texttt{INF} denotes infinity):\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    Still, this function is not efficient,\n    because there may be an exponential number of ways\n    to construct the sum.\n    However, next we will see how to make the\n    function efficient using a technique called memoization.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Using memoization}\n\n    \\index{memoization}\n\n    The idea of dynamic programming is to use\n    \\key{memoization} to efficiently calculate\n    values of a recursive function.\n    This means that the values of the function\n    are stored in an array after calculating them.\n    For each parameter, the value of the function\n    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,\n    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.\n\n    In this problem, we use arrays\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    bool ready[N];\n    int value[N];\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    where $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates\n    whether the value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,\n    and if it is, $\\texttt{value}[x]$\n    contains this value.\n    The constant $N$ has been chosen so\n    that all required values fit in the arrays.\n\n    Now the function can be efficiently\n    implemented as follows:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    int solve(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return INF;\n        if (x == 0) return 0;\n        if (ready[x]) return value[x];\n        int best = INF;\n        for (auto c : coins) {\n            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);\n        }\n        value[x] = best;\n        ready[x] = true;\n        return best;\n    }\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function handles the base cases\n    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.\n    Then the function checks from\n    $\\texttt{ready}[x]$ if\n    $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored\n    in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    and if it is, the function directly returns it.\n    Otherwise the function calculates the value\n    of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$\n    recursively and stores it in $\\texttt{value}[x]$.\n\n    This function works efficiently,\n    because the answer for each parameter $x$\n    is calculated recursively only once.\n    After a value of $\\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\\texttt{value}[x]$,\n    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the\n    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.\n    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(nk)$,\n    where $n$ is the target sum and $k$ is the number of coins.\n\n    Note that we can also \\emph{iteratively}\n    construct the array \\texttt{value} using\n    a loop that simply calculates all the values\n    of $\\texttt{solve}$ for parameters $0 \\ldots n\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum\n    Part: 1/2\n    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum\n\n    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).\n\n    ## Problem statement\n\n    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \\ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \\ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:\n\n    $$ \\max_{ 1 \\le l \\le r \\le n } \\sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$\n\n    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.\n    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.\n\n    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.\n\n    ## Algorithm 1\n\n    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm is very simple.\n\n    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \\sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.\n\n    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \\ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.\n\n    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.\n\n    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.\n\n    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ \u2014 we will only need the current element from it.\n\n    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.\n\n    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        int cur = sum - min_sum;\n        if (cur > ans) {\n            ans = cur;\n            ans_l = min_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < min_sum) {\n            min_sum = sum;\n            min_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Algorithm 2\n\n    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.\n\n    ### Algorithm description\n\n    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.\n\n    **Proof:**\n\n    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum \u2014 so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.\n\n    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.\n\n    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a \"critical\" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \\ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.\n\n    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.\n\n    ### Implementation\n\n    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        ans = max(ans, sum);\n        sum = max(sum, 0);\n    }\n    ```\n\n    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:\n\n    ```cpp\n    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;\n    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;\n\n    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {\n        sum += a[r];\n        if (sum > ans) {\n            ans = sum;\n            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;\n            ans_r = r;\n        }\n        if (sum < 0) {\n            sum = 0;\n            minus_pos = r;\n        }\n    }\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The formula states that for a given integer `n`, the maximum sum can be obtained by either taking the value of `n` itself or the sum of the maximum sums of `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`.\n\n2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**:\n   The problem can be solved using recursion. For each value of `n`, we will compute the maximum sum by recursively calling the function for `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`. We will also compare this sum with `n` itself to determine which is larger. To optimize the solution, we can use memoization to store previously computed results for specific values of `n`, avoiding redundant calculations.\n\n3. **Pseudocode Solution**:\n   ```\n   function get_max_sum(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 0\n       if n is in memo:\n           return memo[n]\n       max_sum = max(get_max_sum(n/2) + get_max_sum(n/3) + get_max_sum(n/4) + get_max_sum(n/5), n)\n       memo[n] = max_sum\n       return max_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Python 3 Solution**:\n```python\n# Initialize a dictionary to store computed results for memoization\nmemo = {}\n\ndef get_max_sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base case: if n is 0, the maximum sum is 0\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    # Check if the result for n is already computed\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    # Calculate the maximum sum using the recursive formula\n    max_sum = max(get_max_sum(n // 2) + get_max_sum(n // 3) + get_max_sum(n // 4) + get_max_sum(n // 5), n)\n    # Store the computed result in the memo dictionary\n    memo[n] = max_sum\n    return max_sum\n```"
