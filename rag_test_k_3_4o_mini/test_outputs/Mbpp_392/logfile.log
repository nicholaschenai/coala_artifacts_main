INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/392 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the maximum sum possible for a given integer `n` using a specific equation. The equation states that for any integer `n`, the maximum sum can be found by either taking the value of `n` itself or the sum of the maximum sums of `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. For any integer `n`, we will check if we can get a larger sum by breaking it down into smaller parts (i.e., `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`) and summing their maximum sums. If the sum of these parts is greater than `n`, we will return that sum; otherwise, we will return `n`. We will also use memoization to store previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function get_max_sum(n):
       if n is 0:
           return 0
       if n is in memo:
           return memo[n]
       sum_parts = get_max_sum(n/2) + get_max_sum(n/3) + get_max_sum(n/4) + get_max_sum(n/5)
       memo[n] = max(sum_parts, n)
       return memo[n]

   initialize memo as an empty dictionary
   call get_max_sum with the input value
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**
```python
# Initialize a dictionary to store previously computed results
memo = {}

def get_max_sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Base case: if n is 0, the maximum sum is also 0
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    # Check if the result for n is already computed
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    # Recursively calculate the maximum sums for n/2, n/3, n/4, and n/5
    sum_parts = get_max_sum(n // 2) + get_max_sum(n // 3) + get_max_sum(n // 4) + get_max_sum(n // 5)
    # Store the maximum of the calculated sum or n itself in the memo dictionary
    memo[n] = max(sum_parts, n)
    # Return the computed maximum sum for n
    return memo[n]

    Section: Maximum subarray sum
    Part: 1/1
    \section{Maximum subarray sum}

    \index{maximum subarray sum}

    There are often several possible algorithms
    for solving a problem such that their
    time complexities are different.
    This section discusses a classic problem that
    has a straightforward $O(n^3)$ solution.
    However, by designing a better algorithm, it
    is possible to solve the problem in $O(n^2)$
    time and even in $O(n)$ time.

    Given an array of $n$ numbers,
    our task is to calculate the
    \key{maximum subarray sum}, i.e.,
    the largest possible sum of 
    a sequence of consecutive values
    in the array\footnote{J. Bentley's
    book \emph{Programming Pearls} \cite{ben86} made the problem popular.}.
    The problem is interesting when there may be
    negative values in the array.
    For example, in the array
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \begin{samepage}
    the following subarray produces the maximum sum $10$:
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (6,1);
    \draw (0,0) grid (8,1);

    \node at (0.5,0.5) {$-1$};
    \node at (1.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {$4$};
    \node at (3.5,0.5) {$-3$};
    \node at (4.5,0.5) {$5$};
    \node at (5.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \node at (6.5,0.5) {$-5$};
    \node at (7.5,0.5) {$2$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    \end{samepage}

    We assume that an empty subarray is allowed,
    so the maximum subarray sum is always at least $0$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 1}

    A straightforward way to solve the problem
    is to go through all possible subarrays,
    calculate the sum of values in each subarray and maintain
    the maximum sum.
    The following code implements this algorithm:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int k = a; k <= b; k++) {
                sum += array[k];
            }
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The variables \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} fix the first and
    last index of the subarray,
    and the sum of values is calculated to the variable \texttt{sum}.
    The variable \texttt{best} contains the maximum sum found during the search.

    The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^3)$,
    because it consists of three nested loops 
    that go through the input.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 2}

    It is easy to make Algorithm 1 more efficient
    by removing one loop from it.
    This is possible by calculating the sum at the same
    time when the right end of the subarray moves.
    The result is the following code:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < n; a++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int b = a; b < n; b++) {
            sum += array[b];
            best = max(best,sum);
        }
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}
    After this change, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

    \subsubsection{Algorithm 3}

    Surprisingly, it is possible to solve the problem
    in $O(n)$ time\footnote{In \cite{ben86}, this linear-time algorithm
    is attributed to J. B. Kadane, and the algorithm is sometimes
    called \index{Kadane's algorithm} \key{Kadane's algorithm}.}, which means
    that just one loop is enough.
    The idea is to calculate, for each array position,
    the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at that position.
    After this, the answer for the problem is the
    maximum of those sums.

    Consider the subproblem of finding the maximum-sum subarray
    that ends at position $k$.
    There are two possibilities:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The subarray only contains the element at position $k$.
    \item The subarray consists of a subarray that ends
    at position $k-1$, followed by the element at position $k$.
    \end{enumerate}

    In the latter case, since we want to
    find a subarray with maximum sum,
    the subarray that ends at position $k-1$
    should also have the maximum sum.
    Thus, we can solve the problem efficiently
    by calculating the maximum subarray sum
    for each ending position from left to right.

    The following code implements the algorithm:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    int best = 0, sum = 0;
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        sum = max(array[k],sum+array[k]);
        best = max(best,sum);
    }
    cout << best << "\n";
    \end{lstlisting}

    The algorithm only contains one loop
    that goes through the input,
    so the time complexity is $O(n)$.
    This is also the best possible time complexity,
    because any algorithm for the problem
    has to examine all array elements at least once.

    \subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}

    It is interesting to study how efficient 
    algorithms are in practice.
    The following table shows the running times
    of the above algorithms for different
    values of $n$ on a modern computer.

    In each test, the input was generated randomly.
    The time needed for reading the input was not
    measured.

    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{rrrr}
    array size $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\
    \hline
    $10^2$ & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^3$ & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^4$ & > $10.0$ s & $0.1$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^5$ & > $10.0$ s & $5.3$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^6$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    $10^7$ & > $10.0$ s & > $10.0$ s & $0.0$ s \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    The comparison shows that all algorithms
    are efficient when the input size is small,
    but larger inputs bring out remarkable
    differences in the running times of the algorithms.
    Algorithm 1 becomes slow
    when $n=10^4$, and Algorithm 2
    becomes slow when $n=10^5$.
    Only Algorithm 3 is able to process
    even the largest inputs instantly.

    \chapter{Dynamic programming}

    \index{dynamic programming}

    \key{Dynamic programming}
    is a technique that combines the correctness
    of complete search and the efficiency
    of greedy algorithms.
    Dynamic programming can be applied if the
    problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems
    that can be solved independently.

    There are two uses for dynamic programming:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item
    \key{Finding an optimal solution}:
    We want to find a solution that is
    as large as possible or as small as possible.
    \item
    \key{Counting the number of solutions}:
    We want to calculate the total number of
    possible solutions.
    \end{itemize}

    We will first see how dynamic programming can
    be used to find an optimal solution,
    and then we will use the same idea for
    counting the solutions.

    Understanding dynamic programming is a milestone
    in every competitive programmer's career.
    While the basic idea is simple,
    the challenge is how to apply
    dynamic programming to different problems.
    This chapter introduces a set of classic problems
    that are a good starting point.

    \section{Coin problem}

    We first focus on a problem that we
    have already seen in Chapter 6:
    Given a set of coin values $\texttt{coins} = \{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_k\}$
    and a target sum of money $n$, our task is to
    form the sum $n$ using as few coins as possible.

    In Chapter 6, we solved the problem using a
    greedy algorithm that always chooses the largest
    possible coin.
    The greedy algorithm works, for example,
    when the coins are the euro coins,
    but in the general case the greedy algorithm
    does not necessarily produce an optimal solution.

    Now is time to solve the problem efficiently
    using dynamic programming, so that the algorithm
    works for any coin set.
    The dynamic programming
    algorithm is based on a recursive function
    that goes through all possibilities how to
    form the sum, like a brute force algorithm.
    However, the dynamic programming
    algorithm is efficient because
    it uses \emph{memoization} and
    calculates the answer to each subproblem only once.

    \subsubsection{Recursive formulation}

    The idea in dynamic programming is to
    formulate the problem recursively so
    that the solution to the problem can be
    calculated from solutions to smaller
    subproblems.
    In the coin problem, a natural recursive
    problem is as follows:
    what is the smallest number of coins
    required to form a sum $x$?

    Let $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    denote the minimum
    number of coins required for a sum $x$.
    The values of the function depend on the
    values of the coins.
    For example, if $\texttt{coins} = \{1,3,4\}$,
    the first values of the function are as follows:

    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \texttt{solve}(0) & = & 0 \\
    \texttt{solve}(1) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(2) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(3) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(4) & = & 1 \\
    \texttt{solve}(5) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(6) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(7) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(8) & = & 2 \\
    \texttt{solve}(9) & = & 3 \\
    \texttt{solve}(10) & = & 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]

    For example, $\texttt{solve}(10)=3$,
    because at least 3 coins are needed
    to form the sum 10.
    The optimal solution is $3+3+4=10$.

    The essential property of $\texttt{solve}$ is
    that its values can be
    recursively calculated from its smaller values.
    The idea is to focus on the \emph{first}
    coin that we choose for the sum.
    For example, in the above scenario,
    the first coin can be either 1, 3 or 4.
    If we first choose coin 1,
    the remaining task is to form the sum 9
    using the minimum number of coins,
    which is a subproblem of the original problem.
    Of course, the same applies to coins 3 and 4.
    Thus, we can use the following recursive formula
    to calculate the minimum number of coins:
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
    \texttt{solve}(x) = \min( & \texttt{solve}(x-1)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-3)+1, \\
                               & \texttt{solve}(x-4)+1).
    \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    The base case of the recursion is $\texttt{solve}(0)=0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    For example,
    \[ \texttt{solve}(10) = \texttt{solve}(7)+1 = \texttt{solve}(4)+2 = \texttt{solve}(0)+3 = 3.\]

    Now we are ready to give a general recursive function
    that calculates the minimum number of
    coins needed to form a sum $x$:
    \begin{equation*}
        \texttt{solve}(x) = \begin{cases}
                   \infty               & x < 0\\
                   0               & x = 0\\
                   \min_{c \in \texttt{coins}} \texttt{solve}(x-c)+1 & x > 0 \\
               \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}

    First, if $x<0$, the value is $\infty$,
    because it is impossible to form a negative
    sum of money.
    Then, if $x=0$, the value is $0$,
    because no coins are needed to form an empty sum.
    Finally, if $x>0$, the variable $c$ goes through
    all possibilities how to choose the first coin
    of the sum.

    Once a recursive function that solves the problem
    has been found,
    we can directly implement a solution in C++
    (the constant \texttt{INF} denotes infinity):

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    Still, this function is not efficient,
    because there may be an exponential number of ways
    to construct the sum.
    However, next we will see how to make the
    function efficient using a technique called memoization.

    \subsubsection{Using memoization}

    \index{memoization}

    The idea of dynamic programming is to use
    \key{memoization} to efficiently calculate
    values of a recursive function.
    This means that the values of the function
    are stored in an array after calculating them.
    For each parameter, the value of the function
    is calculated recursively only once, and after this,
    the value can be directly retrieved from the array.

    In this problem, we use arrays
    \begin{lstlisting}
    bool ready[N];
    int value[N];
    \end{lstlisting}

    where $\texttt{ready}[x]$ indicates
    whether the value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been calculated,
    and if it is, $\texttt{value}[x]$
    contains this value.
    The constant $N$ has been chosen so
    that all required values fit in the arrays.

    Now the function can be efficiently
    implemented as follows:

    \begin{lstlisting}
    int solve(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return INF;
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        if (ready[x]) return value[x];
        int best = INF;
        for (auto c : coins) {
            best = min(best, solve(x-c)+1);
        }
        value[x] = best;
        ready[x] = true;
        return best;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}

    The function handles the base cases
    $x<0$ and $x=0$ as previously.
    Then the function checks from
    $\texttt{ready}[x]$ if
    $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has already been stored
    in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    and if it is, the function directly returns it.
    Otherwise the function calculates the value
    of $\texttt{solve}(x)$
    recursively and stores it in $\texttt{value}[x]$.

    This function works efficiently,
    because the answer for each parameter $x$
    is calculated recursively only once.
    After a value of $\texttt{solve}(x)$ has been stored in $\texttt{value}[x]$,
    it can be efficiently retrieved whenever the
    function will be called again with the parameter $x$.

    Title: Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum
    Part: 1/2
    # Search the subarray with the maximum/minimum sum

    Here, we consider the problem of finding a subarray with maximum sum, as well as some of its variations (including the algorithm for solving this problem online).

    ## Problem statement

    Given an array of numbers $a[1 \ldots n]$. It is required to find a subarray $a[l \ldots r]$ with the maximal sum:

    $$ \max_{ 1 \le l \le r \le n } \sum_{i=l}^{r} a[i].$$

    For example, if all integers in array $a[]$ were non-negative, then the answer would be the array itself.
    However, the solution is non-trivial when the array can contain both positive and negative numbers.

    It is clear that the problem of finding the **minimum** subarray is essentially the same, you just need to change the signs of all numbers.

    ## Algorithm 1

    Here we consider an almost obvious algorithm. (Next, we'll look at another algorithm, which is a little harder to come up with, but its implementation is even shorter.)

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm is very simple.

    We introduce for convenience the **notation**: $s[i] = \sum_{j=1}^{i} a[j]$. That is, the array $s[i]$ is an array of partial sums of array $a[]$. Also, set $s[0] = 0$.

    Let us now iterate over the index $r = 1 \ldots n$, and learn how to quickly find the optimal $l$ for each current value $r$, at which the maximum sum is reached on the subarray $[l, r]$.

    Formally, this means that for the current $r$ we need to find an $l$ (not exceeding $r$), so that the value of $s[r] - s[l-1]$ is maximal. After a trivial transformation, we can see that we need to find in the array $s[]$ a minimum on the segment $[0, r-1]$.

    From here, we immediately obtain a solution: we simply store where the current minimum is in the array $s[]$. Using this minimum, we find the current optimal index $l$ in $O(1)$, and when moving from the current index $r$ to the next one, we simply update this minimum.

    Obviously, this algorithm works in $O(n)$ and is asymptotically optimal.

    ### Implementation

    To implement it, we don't even need to explicitly store an array of partial sums $s[]$ — we will only need the current element from it.

    The implementation is given in 0-indexed arrays, not in 1-numbering as described above.

    We first give a solution that finds a simple numerical answer without finding the indices of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0, min_sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum - min_sum);
        min_sum = min(min_sum, sum);
    }
    ```

    Now we give a full version of the solution, which additionally also finds the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, min_sum = 0, min_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        int cur = sum - min_sum;
        if (cur > ans) {
            ans = cur;
            ans_l = min_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < min_sum) {
            min_sum = sum;
            min_pos = r;
        }
    }
    ```

    ## Algorithm 2

    Here we consider a different algorithm. It is a little more difficult to understand, but it is more elegant than the above, and its implementation is a little bit shorter. This algorithm was proposed by Jay Kadane in 1984.

    ### Algorithm description

    The algorithm itself is as follows. Let's go through the array and accumulate the current partial sum in some variable $s$. If at some point $s$ is negative, we just assign $s=0$. It is argued that the maximum all the values that the variable $s$ is assigned to during the algorithm will be the answer to the problem.

    **Proof:**

    Consider the first index when the sum of $s$ becomes negative. This means that starting with a zero partial sum, we eventually obtain a negative partial sum — so this whole prefix of the array, as well as any suffix, has a negative sum. Therefore, this subarray never contributes to the partial sum of any subarray of which it is a prefix, and can simply be dropped.

    However, this is not enough to prove the algorithm. In the algorithm, we are actually limited in finding the answer only to such segments that begin immediately after the places when $s<0$ happened.

    But, in fact, consider an arbitrary segment $[l, r]$, and $l$ is not in such a "critical" position (i.e. $l > p+1$, where $p$ is the last such position, in which $s<0$). Since the last critical position is strictly earlier than in $l-1$, it turns out that the sum of $a[p+1 \ldots l-1]$ is non-negative. This means that by moving $l$ to position $p+1$, we will increase the answer or, in extreme cases, we will not change it.

    One way or another, it turns out that when searching for an answer, you can limit yourself to only segments that begin immediately after the positions in which $s<0$ appeared. This proves that the algorithm is correct.

    ### Implementation

    As in algorithm 1, we first gave a simplified implementation that looks for only a numerical answer without finding the boundaries of the desired segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], sum = 0;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        ans = max(ans, sum);
        sum = max(sum, 0);
    }
    ```

    A complete solution, maintaining the indexes of the boundaries of the corresponding segment:

    ```cpp
    int ans = a[0], ans_l = 0, ans_r = 0;
    int sum = 0, minus_pos = -1;

    for (int r = 0; r < n; ++r) {
        sum += a[r];
        if (sum > ans) {
            ans = sum;
            ans_l = minus_pos + 1;
            ans_r = r;
        }
        if (sum < 0) {
            sum = 0;
            minus_pos = r;
        }
    }

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/392 [generation text] 1. **Restatement of the Problem**: 
   We need to create a function that calculates the maximum sum possible using a specific recursive formula. The formula states that for a given integer `n`, the maximum sum can be obtained by either taking the value of `n` itself or the sum of the maximum sums of `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`.

2. **Conceptualizing a Solution**:
   The problem can be solved using recursion. For each value of `n`, we will compute the maximum sum by recursively calling the function for `n/2`, `n/3`, `n/4`, and `n/5`. We will also compare this sum with `n` itself to determine which is larger. To optimize the solution, we can use memoization to store previously computed results for specific values of `n`, avoiding redundant calculations.

3. **Pseudocode Solution**:
   ```
   function get_max_sum(n):
       if n is 0:
           return 0
       if n is in memo:
           return memo[n]
       max_sum = max(get_max_sum(n/2) + get_max_sum(n/3) + get_max_sum(n/4) + get_max_sum(n/5), n)
       memo[n] = max_sum
       return max_sum
   ```

# Initialize a dictionary to store computed results for memoization
