INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/784 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and finds the first even number and the first odd number in that list. Then, we will calculate the product of these two numbers and return the result.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will iterate through the list of numbers.
   - We will keep track of the first even number we find and the first odd number we find.
   - Once we have both the first even and first odd numbers, we will multiply them together and return the product.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function mul_even_odd(numbers):
       initialize first_even as None
       initialize first_odd as None
       
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is even and first_even is None:
               set first_even to number
           if number is odd and first_odd is None:
               set first_odd to number
           
           if both first_even and first_odd are found:
               break
       
       if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:
           return first_even * first_odd
       else:
           return None  # or some indication that one of them was not found
   ```

        You're given $N$ positive integer pairs $(C_i, J_i)$. You need to find a positive integer pair $(x, y)$ such that $C_i x + J_i y$ is a strictly increasing sequence.

        Among such pairs, find the lexicographically minimum one.
    ??? hint "Solution"
        Rephrasing the statement, $A_i x + B_i y$ must be positive for all $i$, where $A_i = C_i - C_{i-1}$ and $B_i = J_i - J_{i-1}$.

        Among such equations we have four significant groups for $A_i x + B_i y > 0$:

        1. $A_i, B_i > 0$ can be ignored since we're looking for $x, y > 0$.
        2. $A_i, B_i \leq 0$ would provide "IMPOSSIBLE" as an answer.
        3. $A_i > 0$, $B_i \leq 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} < \frac{A_i}{-B_i}$.
        4. $A_i \leq 0$, $B_i > 0$. Such constraints are equivalent to $\frac{y}{x} > \frac{-A_i}{B_i}$.

        Let $\frac{p_0}{q_0}$ be the largest $\frac{-A_i}{B_i}$ from the fourth group and $\frac{p_1}{q_1}$ be the smallest $\frac{A_i}{-B_i}$ from the third group.

        The problem is now, given $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$, find a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $(q;p)$ is lexicographically smallest and $\frac{p_0}{q_0} < \frac{p}{q} < \frac{p_1}{q_1}$.

    \section{Solving equations}

    \subsubsection*{Diophantine equations}

    \index{Diophantine equation}

    A \key{Diophantine equation}
    %\footnote{Diophantus of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician who lived in the 3th century.}
    is an equation of the form
    \[ ax + by = c, \]
    where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants
    and the values of $x$ and $y$ should be found.
    Each number in the equation has to be an integer.
    For example, one solution for the equation
    $5x+2y=11$ is $x=3$ and $y=-2$.

    \index{extended Euclid's algorithm}

    We can efficiently solve a Diophantine equation
    by using Euclid's algorithm.
    It turns out that we can extend Euclid's algorithm
    so that it will find numbers $x$ and $y$
    that satisfy the following equation:
    \[
    ax + by = \textrm{gcd}(a,b)
    \]

    A Diophantine equation can be solved if
    $c$ is divisible by
    $\textrm{gcd}(a,b)$,
    and otherwise it cannot be solved.

    As an example, let us find numbers $x$ and $y$
    that satisfy the following equation:
    \[
    39x + 15y = 12
    \]
    The equation can be solved, because
    $\textrm{gcd}(39,15)=3$ and $3 \mid 12$.
    When Euclid's algorithm calculates the
    greatest common divisor of 39 and 15,
    it produces the following sequence of function calls:
    \[
    \textrm{gcd}(39,15) = \textrm{gcd}(15,9)
    = \textrm{gcd}(9,6) = \textrm{gcd}(6,3)
    = \textrm{gcd}(3,0) = 3 \]
    This corresponds to the following equations:
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    39 - 2 \cdot 15 & = & 9 \\
    15 - 1 \cdot 9 & = & 6 \\
    9 - 1 \cdot 6 & = & 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    Using these equations, we can derive
    \[
    39 \cdot 2 + 15 \cdot (-5) = 3
    \]
    and by multiplying this by 4, the result is
    \[
    39 \cdot 8 + 15 \cdot (-20) = 12,
    \]
    so a solution to the equation is
    $x=8$ and $y=-20$.

    A solution to a Diophantine equation is not unique,
    because we can form an infinite number of solutions
    if we know one solution.
    If a pair $(x,y)$ is a solution, then also all pairs
    \[(x+\frac{kb}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)},y-\frac{ka}{\textrm{gcd}(a,b)})\]
    are solutions, where $k$ is any integer.

    \subsubsection{Chinese remainder theorem}

    \index{Chinese remainder theorem}

    The \key{Chinese remainder theorem} solves
    a group of equations of the form
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    x & = & a_1 \bmod m_1 \\
    x & = & a_2 \bmod m_2 \\
    \cdots \\
    x & = & a_n \bmod m_n \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    where all pairs of $m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_n$ are coprime.

    Let $x^{-1}_m$ be the inverse of $x$ modulo $m$, and
    \[ X_k = \frac{m_1 m_2 \cdots m_n}{m_k}.\]
    Using this notation, a solution to the equations is
    \[x = a_1 X_1 {X_1}^{-1}_{m_1} + a_2 X_2 {X_2}^{-1}_{m_2} + \cdots + a_n X_n {X_n}^{-1}_{m_n}.\]
    In this solution, for each $k=1,2,\ldots,n$,
    \[a_k X_k {X_k}^{-1}_{m_k} \bmod m_k = a_k,\]
    because
    \[X_k {X_k}^{-1}_{m_k} \bmod m_k = 1.\]
    Since all other terms in the sum are divisible by $m_k$,
    they have no effect on the remainder,
    and $x \bmod m_k = a_k$.

    For example, a solution for
    \[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    x & = & 3 \bmod 5 \\
    x & = & 4 \bmod 7 \\
    x & = & 2 \bmod 3 \\
    \end{array}
    \]
    is
    \[ 3 \cdot 21 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 15 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 35 \cdot 2 = 263.\]

    Once we have found a solution $x$,
    we can create an infinite number of other solutions,
    because all numbers of the form
    \[x+m_1 m_2 \cdots m_n\]
    are solutions.

        Given $N$, $M$, $A$ and $B$, compute $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{N-1} \lfloor \frac{A \cdot i + B}{M} \rfloor$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        This is the most technically troublesome problem so far.

        It is possible to use the same approach and construct the full convex hull of points below the line $y = \frac{Ax+B}{M}$.

        We already know how to solve it for $B = 0$. Moreover, we already know how to construct this convex hull up to the closest lattice point to this line on $[0, N-1]$ segment (this is done in the "Crime and Punishment" problem above.

        Now we should note that once we reached the closest point to the line, we can just assume that the line in fact passes through the closest point, as there are no other lattice points on $[0, N-1]$ in between the actual line and the line moved slightly below to pass through the closest point.

        That being said, to construct the full convex hull below the line $y=\frac{Ax+B}{M}$ on $[0, N-1]$, we can construct it up to the closest point to the line on $[0, N-1]$ and then continue as if the line passes through this point, reusing algorithm for constructing convex hull with $B=0$:

    !!! example "[OKC 2 - From Modular to Rational](https://codeforces.com/gym/102354/problem/I)"
        There is a rational number $\frac{p}{q}$ such that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$. You may ask the value of $p q^{-1}$ modulo $m \sim 10^9$ for several prime numbers $m$. Recover $\frac{p}{q}$.

        _Equivalent formulation:_ Find $x$ that delivers the minimum of $Ax \;\bmod\; M$ for $1 \leq x \leq N$.

    ??? hint "Solution"
        Due to Chinese remainder theorem, asking the result modulo several prime numbers is the same as asking it modulo their product. Due to this, without loss of generality we'll assume that we know the remainder modulo sufficiently large number $m$.

        There could be several possible solutions $(p, q)$ to $p \equiv qr \pmod m$ for a given remainder $r$. However, if $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ are both the solutions then it also holds that $p_1 q_2 \equiv p_2 q_1 \pmod m$. Assuming that $\frac{p_1}{q_1} \neq \frac{p_2}{q_2}$ it means that $|p_1 q_2 - p_2 q_1|$ is at least $m$.

        In the statement we were told that $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$, so if both $p_1, q_1$ and $p_2, q_2$ are at most $10^9$, then the difference is at most $10^{18}$. For $m > 10^{18}$ it means that the solution $\frac{p}{q}$ with $1 \leq p, q \leq 10^9$ is unique, as a rational number.

        So, the problem boils down, given $r$ modulo $m$, to finding any $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr \;\bmod\; m \leq 10^9$.

        This is effectively the same as finding $q$ that delivers the minimum possible $qr \bmod m$ for $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$.

        For $qr = km + b$ it means that we need to find a pair $(q, m)$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $qr - km \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        Since $m$ is constant, we can divide by it and further restate it as find $q$ such that $1 \leq q \leq 10^9$ and $\frac{r}{m} q - k \geq 0$ is the minimum possible.

        In terms of continued fractions it means that $\frac{k}{q}$ is the best diophantine approximation to $\frac{r}{m}$ and it is sufficient to only check lower semiconvergents of $\frac{r}{m}$.

        === "Python"
            ```py
            # find Q that minimizes Q*r mod m for 1 <= k <= n < m 
            def mod_min(r, n, m):
                a = fraction(r, m)
                p, q = convergents(a)
                for i in range(2, len(q)):
                    if i % 2 == 1 and (i + 1 == len(q) or q[i+1] > n):
                        t = (n - q[i-1]) // q[i]
                        return q[i-1] + t*q[i]
            ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/784 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and finds the product of the first even number and the first odd number in that list. If there are no even or odd numbers, the function should handle that appropriately.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   - We will iterate through the list of integers.
   - We will keep track of the first even and the first odd number we encounter.
   - Once we find both, we will multiply them together and return the result.
   - If we do not find either an even or an odd number, we will return a specific value (like 0) to indicate that the product cannot be computed.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function mul_even_odd(numbers):
       initialize first_even to None
       initialize first_odd to None
       
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is even and first_even is None:
               set first_even to number
           if number is odd and first_odd is None:
               set first_odd to number
           if both first_even and first_odd are found:
               break
       
       if first_even is None or first_odd is None:
           return 0  # or some indication of failure
       else:
           return first_even * first_odd
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
