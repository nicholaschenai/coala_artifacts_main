If there are no even or odd numbers, the function should handle that appropriately.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the list of integers.\n   - We will keep track of the first even and the first odd number we encounter.\n   - Once we find both, we will multiply them together and return the result.\n   - If we do not find either an even or an odd number, we will return a specific value (like 0) to indicate that the product cannot be computed.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function mul_even_odd(numbers):\n       initialize first_even to None\n       initialize first_odd to None\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even and first_even is None:\n               set first_even to number\n           if number is odd and first_odd is None:\n               set first_odd to number\n           if both first_even and first_odd are found:\n               break\n       \n       if first_even is None or first_odd is None:\n           return 0  # or some indication of failure\n       else:\n           return first_even * first_odd\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef mul_even_odd(numbers):\n    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers\n    first_even = None\n    first_odd = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of numbers\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0 and first_even is None:\n            first_even = number  # Store the first even number\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0 and first_odd is None:\n            first_odd = number  # Store the first odd number\n        \n        # If both first_even and first_odd are found, we can stop searching\n        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # If we didn't find either an even or an odd number, return 0\n    if first_even is None or first_odd is None:\n        return 0  # Indicating that the product cannot be computed\n    else:\n        # Return the product of the first even and odd numbers found\n        return first_even * first_odd\n```"
