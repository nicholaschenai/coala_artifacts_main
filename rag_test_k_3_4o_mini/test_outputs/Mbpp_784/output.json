    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and finds the product of the first even number and the first odd number in that list. If there are no even or odd numbers, the function should handle that appropriately.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   - We will iterate through the list of integers.\n   - We will keep track of the first even and the first odd number we encounter.\n   - Once we find both, we will multiply them together and return the result.\n   - If we do not find either an even or an odd number, we will return a specific value (like 0) to indicate that the product cannot be computed.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function mul_even_odd(numbers):\n       initialize first_even to None\n       initialize first_odd to None\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is even and first_even is None:\n               set first_even to number\n           if number is odd and first_odd is None:\n               set first_odd to number\n           if both first_even and first_odd are found:\n               break\n       \n       if first_even is None or first_odd is None:\n           return 0  # or some indication of failure\n       else:\n           return first_even * first_odd\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef mul_even_odd(numbers):\n    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers\n    first_even = None\n    first_odd = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the list of numbers\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0 and first_even is None:\n            first_even = number  # Store the first even number\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0 and first_odd is None:\n            first_odd = number  # Store the first odd number\n        \n        # If both first_even and first_odd are found, we can stop searching\n        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # If we didn't find either an even or an odd number, return 0\n    if first_even is None or first_odd is None:\n        return 0  # Indicating that the product cannot be computed\n    else:\n        # Return the product of the first even and odd numbers found\n        return first_even * first_odd\n```",
