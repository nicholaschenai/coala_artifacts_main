INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/751 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given list of numbers represents a min heap. A min heap is a complete binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the array represents a min heap, we can iterate through the array and for each element, check if it satisfies the min heap property. Specifically, for each element at index `i`, we need to check if it is less than or equal to its children, which are located at indices `2*i + 1` (left child) and `2*i + 2` (right child). If any parent node is greater than its child nodes, the array does not represent a min heap.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_min_heap(arr):

    Title: Binary search
    Part: 2/2
    ```

    ### Binary search on the answer

    Such situation often occurs when we're asked to compute some value, but we're only capable of checking whether this value is at least $i$. For example, you're given an array $a_1,\dots,a_n$ and you're asked to find the maximum floored average sum

    $$
    \left \lfloor \frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \right\rfloor
    $$

    among all possible pairs of $l,r$ such that $r-l \geq x$. One of simple ways to solve this problem is to check whether the answer is at least $\lambda$, that is if there is a pair $l, r$ such that the following is true:

    $$
    \frac{a_l + a_{l+1} + \dots + a_r}{r-l+1} \geq \lambda.
    $$

    Equivalently, it rewrites as

    $$
    (a_l - \lambda) + (a_{l+1} - \lambda) + \dots + (a_r - \lambda) \geq 0,
    $$

    so now we need to check whether there is a subarray of a new array $a_i - \lambda$ of length at least $x+1$ with non-negative sum, which is doable with some prefix sums.

    ## Continuous search

    Let $f : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ be a real-valued function that is continuous on a segment $[L, R]$.

    Without loss of generality assume that $f(L) \leq f(R)$. From [intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem) it follows that for any $y \in [f(L), f(R)]$ there is $x \in [L, R]$ such that $f(x) = y$. Note that, unlike previous paragraphs, the function is _not_ required to be monotonous.

    The value $x$ could be approximated up to $\pm\delta$ in $O\left(\log \frac{R-L}{\delta}\right)$ time for any specific value of $\delta$. The idea is essentially the same, if we take $M \in (L, R)$ then we would be able to reduce the search interval to either $[L, M]$ or $[M, R]$ depending on whether $f(M)$ is larger than $y$. One common example here would be finding roots of odd-degree polynomials.

    For example, let $f(x)=x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. Then $f(L) \to -\infty$ and $f(R) \to +\infty$ with $L \to -\infty$ and $R \to +\infty$. Which means that it is always possible to find sufficiently small $L$ and sufficiently large $R$ such that $f(L) < 0$ and $f(R) > 0$. Then, it is possible to find with binary search arbitrarily small interval containing $x$ such that $f(x)=0$.

    ## Search with powers of 2

    Another noteworthy way to do binary search is, instead of maintaining an active segment, to maintain the current pointer $i$ and the current power $k$. The pointer starts at $i=L$ and then on each iteration one tests the predicate at point $i+2^k$. If the predicate is still $0$, the pointer is advanced from $i$ to $i+2^k$, otherwise it stays the same, then the power $k$ is decreased by $1$.

    This paradigm is widely used in tasks around trees, such as finding lowest common ancestor of two vertices or finding an ancestor of a specific vertex that has a certain height. It could also be adapted to e.g. find the $k$-th non-zero element in a Fenwick tree.

    Title: Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
    Part: 1/1
    # Solve RMQ (Range Minimum Query) by finding LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)

    Given an array `A[0..N-1]`.
    For each query of the form `[L, R]` we want to find the minimum in the array `A` starting from position `L` and ending with position `R`.
    We will assume that the array `A` doesn't change in the process, i.e. this article describes a solution to the static RMQ problem

    Here is a description of an asymptotically optimal solution.
    It stands apart from other solutions for the RMQ problem, since it is very different from them:
    it reduces the RMQ problem to the LCA problem, and then uses the [Farach-Colton and Bender algorithm](lca_farachcoltonbender.md), which reduces the LCA problem back to a specialized RMQ problem and solves that.

    ## Algorithm

    We construct a **Cartesian tree** from the array `A`.
    A Cartesian tree of an array `A` is a binary tree with the min-heap property (the value of parent node has to be smaller or equal than the value of its children) such that the in-order traversal of the tree visits the nodes in the same order as they are in the array `A`.

    In other words, a Cartesian tree is a recursive data structure.
    The array `A` will be partitioned into 3 parts: the prefix of the array up to the minimum, the minimum, and the remaining suffix.
    The root of the tree will be a node corresponding to the minimum element of the array `A`, the left subtree will be the Cartesian tree of the prefix, and the right subtree will be a Cartesian tree of the suffix.

    In the following image you can see one array of length 10 and the corresponding Cartesian tree.
    <center>![Image of Cartesian Tree](CartesianTree.png)</center>

    The range minimum query `[l, r]` is equivalent to the lowest common ancestor query `[l', r']`, where `l'` is the node corresponding to the element `A[l]` and `r'` the node corresponding to the element `A[r]`.
    Indeed the node corresponding to the smallest element in the range has to be an ancestor of all nodes in the range, therefor also from `l'` and `r'`.
    This automatically follows from the min-heap property.
    And is also has to be the lowest ancestor, because otherwise `l'` and `r'` would be both in the left or in the right subtree, which generates a contradiction since in such a case the minimum wouldn't even be in the range.

    In the following image you can see the LCA queries for the RMQ queries `[1, 3]` and `[5, 9]`.
    In the first query the LCA of the nodes `A[1]` and `A[3]` is the node corresponding to `A[2]` which has the value 2, and in the second query the LCA of `A[5]` and `A[9]` is the node corresponding to `A[8]` which has the value 3.
    <center>![LCA queries in the Cartesian Tree](CartesianTreeLCA.png)</center>

    Such a tree can be built in $O(N)$ time and the Farach-Colton and Benders algorithm can preprocess the tree in $O(N)$ and find the LCA in $O(1)$.

    ## Construction of a Cartesian tree

    We will build the Cartesian tree by adding the elements one after another.
    In each step we maintain a valid Cartesian tree of all the processed elements.
    It is easy to see, that adding an element `s[i]` can only change the nodes in the most right path - starting at the root and repeatedly taking the right child - of the tree.
    The subtree of the node with the smallest, but greater or equal than `s[i]`, value becomes the left subtree of `s[i]`, and the tree with root `s[i]` will become the new right subtree of the node with the biggest, but smaller than `s[i]` value.

    This can be implemented by using a stack to store the indices of the most right nodes.

    ```cpp
    vector<int> parent(n, -1);
    stack<int> s;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int last = -1;
        while (!s.empty() && A[s.top()] >= A[i]) {
            last = s.top();
            s.pop();
        }
        if (!s.empty())
            parent[i] = s.top();
        if (last >= 0)
            parent[last] = i;
        s.push(i);
    }
    ```

    Title: Minimum stack / Minimum queue
    Part: 1/1
    # Minimum stack / Minimum queue

    In this article we will consider three problems: 
    first we will modify a stack in a way that allows us to find the smallest element of the stack in $O(1)$, then we will do the same thing with a queue, and finally we will use these data structures to find the minimum in all subarrays of a fixed length in an array in $O(n)$

    ## Stack modification

    We want to modify the stack data structure in such a way, that it possible to find the smallest element in the stack in $O(1)$ time, while maintaining the same asymptotic behavior for adding and removing elements from the stack.
    Quick reminder, on a stack we only add and remove elements on one end.

    To do this, we will not only store the elements in the stack, but we will store them in pairs: the element itself and the minimum in the stack starting from this element and below.

    ```cpp
    stack<pair<int, int>> st;
    ```

    It is clear that finding the minimum in the whole stack consists only of looking at the value `stack.top().second`.

    It is also obvious that adding or removing a new element to the stack can be done in constant time.

    Implementation:

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    int new_min = st.empty() ? new_elem : min(new_elem, st.top().second);
    st.push({new_elem, new_min});
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    int removed_element = st.top().first;
    st.pop();
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = st.top().second;
    ```

    ## Queue modification (method 1)

    Now we want to achieve the same operations with a queue, i.e. we want to add elements at the end and remove them from the front.

    Here we consider a simple method for modifying a queue.
    It has a big disadvantage though, because the modified queue will actually not store all elements.

    The key idea is to only store the items in the queue that are needed to determine the minimum.
    Namely we will keep the queue in nondecreasing order (i.e. the smallest value will be stored in the head), and of course not in any arbitrary way, the actual minimum has to be always contained in the queue.
    This way the smallest element will always be in the head of the queue.
    Before adding a new element to the queue, it is enough to make a "cut":
    we will remove all trailing elements of the queue that are larger than the new element, and afterwards add the new element to the queue. 
    This way we don't break the order of the queue, and we will also not loose the current element if it is at any subsequent step the minimum. 
    All the elements that we removed can never be a minimum itself, so this operation is allowed.
    When we want to extract an element from the head, it actually might not be there (because we removed it previously while adding a smaller element). 
    Therefore when deleting an element from a queue we need to know the value of the element.
    If the head of the queue has the same value, we can safely remove it, otherwise we do nothing.

    Consider the implementations of the above operations:

    ```cpp
    deque<int> q;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = q.front();
    ```

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    while (!q.empty() && q.back() > new_element)
        q.pop_back();
    q.push_back(new_element);
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (!q.empty() && q.front() == remove_element)
        q.pop_front();
    ```

    It is clear that on average all these operation only take $O(1)$ time (because every element can only be pushed and popped once).

    ## Queue modification (method 2)

    This is a modification of method 1.
    We want to be able to remove elements without knowing which element we have to remove.
    We can accomplish that by storing the index for each element in the queue.
    And we also remember how many elements we already have added and removed.

    ```cpp
    deque<pair<int, int>> q;
    int cnt_added = 0;
    int cnt_removed = 0;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = q.front().first;
    ```

    * Adding an element:
    ```cpp
    while (!q.empty() && q.back().first > new_element)
        q.pop_back();
    q.push_back({new_element, cnt_added});
    cnt_added++;
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (!q.empty() && q.front().second == cnt_removed) 
        q.pop_front();
    cnt_removed++;
    ```

    ## Queue modification (method 3)

    Here we consider another way of modifying a queue to find the minimum in $O(1)$.
    This way is somewhat more complicated to implement, but this time we actually store all elements.
    And we also can remove an element from the front without knowing its value.

    The idea is to reduce the problem to the problem of stacks, which was already solved by us.
    So we only need to learn how to simulate a queue using two stacks.

    We make two stacks, `s1` and `s2`. 
    Of course these stack will be of the modified form, so that we can find the minimum in $O(1)$. 
    We will add new elements to the stack `s1`, and remove elements from the stack `s2`.
    If at any time the stack `s2` is empty, we move all elements from `s1` to `s2` (which essentially reverses the order of those elements).
    Finally finding the minimum in a queue involves just finding the minimum of both stacks.

    Thus we perform all operations in $O(1)$ on average (each element will be once added to stack `s1`, once transferred to `s2`, and once popped from `s2`)

    Implementation:

    ```cpp
    stack<pair<int, int>> s1, s2;
    ```

    * Finding the minimum:
    ```cpp
    if (s1.empty() || s2.empty()) 
        minimum = s1.empty() ? s2.top().second : s1.top().second;
    else
        minimum = min(s1.top().second, s2.top().second);
    ```

    * Add element:
    ```cpp
    int minimum = s1.empty() ? new_element : min(new_element, s1.top().second);
    s1.push({new_element, minimum});
    ```

    * Removing an element:
    ```cpp
    if (s2.empty()) {
        while (!s1.empty()) {
            int element = s1.top().first;
            s1.pop();
            int minimum = s2.empty() ? element : min(element, s2.top().second);
            s2.push({element, minimum});
        }
    }
    int remove_element = s2.top().first;
    s2.pop();
    ```

    ## Finding the minimum for all subarrays of fixed length

    Suppose we are given an array $A$ of length $N$ and a given $M \le N$.
    We have to find the minimum of each subarray of length $M$ in this array, i.e. we have to find:

    $$\min_{0 \le i \le M-1} A[i], \min_{1 \le i \le M} A[i], \min_{2 \le i \le M+1} A[i],~\dots~, \min_{N-M \le i \le N-1} A[i]$$

    We have to solve this problem in linear time, i.e. $O(n)$.

    We can use any of the three modified queues to solve the problem.
    The solutions should be clear:
    we add the first $M$ element of the array, find and output its minimum, then add the next element to the queue and remove the first element of the array, find and output its minimum, etc. 
    Since all operations with the queue are performed in constant time on average, the complexity of the whole algorithm will be $O(n)$.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/751 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given list of numbers satisfies the properties of a min-heap. A min-heap is a complete binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes. The function should return `True` if the list represents a min-heap and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the list represents a min-heap, we can iterate through the list and check the properties of the heap. For each element at index `i`, we need to check if it is less than or equal to its children, which are located at indices `2*i + 1` (left child) and `2*i + 2` (right child). If any parent node is greater than its child nodes, the list does not represent a min-heap.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_min_heap(arr):

INFO - raw_msg:
 1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: 
   We need to create a function that checks if a given list of numbers satisfies the properties of a min-heap. A min-heap is a complete binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child nodes. The function should return `True` if the list represents a min-heap and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: 
   To determine if the list represents a min-heap, we can iterate through the list and check the properties of the heap. For each element at index `i`, we need to check if it is less than or equal to its children, which are located at indices `2*i + 1` (left child) and `2*i + 2` (right child). If any parent node is greater than its child nodes, the list does not represent a min-heap.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:
   ```
   function check_min_heap(arr):
       for i from 0 to length of arr // 2:
           left_child_index = 2 * i + 1
           right_child_index = 2 * i + 2
           if left_child_index < length of arr:
               if arr[i] > arr[left_child_index]:
                   return False
           if right_child_index < length of arr:
               if arr[i] > arr[right_child_index]:
                   return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:
```python
def check_min_heap(arr):
    # Iterate through each parent node in the array
    for i in range(len(arr) // 2):
        # Calculate the indices of the left and right children
        left_child_index = 2 * i + 1
        right_child_index = 2 * i + 2
        
        # Check if the left child exists and if the parent is greater than the left child
        if left_child_index < len(arr):
            if arr[i] > arr[left_child_index]:
                return False
        
        # Check if the right child exists and if the parent is greater than the right child
        if right_child_index < len(arr):
            if arr[i] > arr[right_child_index]:
                return False
