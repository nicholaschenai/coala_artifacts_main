In our case some prime factors may appear multiple times in the prime factorization of $n$.\n\n    If a prime factor $p$ appears $e$ times in the prime factorization of $n$, then we can use the factor $p$ up to $e$ times in the subset.\n    Which means we have $e+1$ choices.\n\n    Therefore if the prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers, then the number of divisors is:\n\n    $$d(n) = (e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$$\n\n    A way of thinking about it is the following:\n\n    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then there are obviously $e_1 + 1$ divisors ($1, p_1, p_1^2, \\dots, p_1^{e_1}$).\n\n    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then you can arrange all divisors in form of a tabular.\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n    & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\\hline\n    1 & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    p_1 & p_1 & p_1 \\cdot p_2 & p_1 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    p_1^2 & p_1^2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\\\\\n    p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2 & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    So the number of divisors is trivially $(e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1)$.\n\n    * A similar argument can be made if there are more then two distinct prime factors.\n\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long numberOfDivisors(long long num) {\n        long long total = 1;\n        for (int i = 2;

This means that for a number like 20, it should not be included in the result because it is not divisible by the digit 0. \n\n2. **Identifying the Issue**:\n   - In the original code, I correctly checked for non-zero digits, but I did not account for the fact that if a number contains a zero digit, it should be excluded from the results entirely. \n   - The number 10 was included in the output because it was divisible by 1, but it contains a 0, which should disqualify it.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**:\n   - I did not explicitly check for the presence of a zero digit before checking divisibility. The logic should have been that if any digit is zero, the number should be skipped entirely.\n   - The check for divisibility should only occur if all digits are non-zero.\n\nTo fix the code, I will add a condition to skip any number that contains a zero digit before checking for divisibility. \n\nHere\u2019s the revised solution:\n\n```python\ndef divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):\n    result = []  # List to store the valid numbers\n    for number in range(startnum, endnum + 1):  # Iterate through the range\n        digits = str(number)  # Convert the number to string to access digits\n        is_divisible = True  # Flag to check divisibility\n        for digit in digits:  # Check each digit\n            if digit == '0':  # If there's a zero digit, skip this number\n                is_divisible = False\n                break\n            if number % int(digit) != 0:  # Check divisibility\n                is_divisible = False  # Set flag to False if not divisible\n                break  # No need to check further\n        if is_divisible:  # If the number is divisible by all its digits\n            result.append(number)  # Add to the result list\n    return result  # Return the list of valid numbers\n```"

In our case some prime factors may appear multiple times in the prime factorization of $n$.\n\n    If a prime factor $p$ appears $e$ times in the prime factorization of $n$, then we can use the factor $p$ up to $e$ times in the subset.\n    Which means we have $e+1$ choices.\n\n    Therefore if the prime factorization of $n$ is $p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$, where $p_i$ are distinct prime numbers, then the number of divisors is:\n\n    $$d(n) = (e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$$\n\n    A way of thinking about it is the following:\n\n    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then there are obviously $e_1 + 1$ divisors ($1, p_1, p_1^2, \\dots, p_1^{e_1}$).\n\n    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then you can arrange all divisors in form of a tabular.\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n    & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\\hline\n    1 & 1 & p_2 & p_2^2 & \\dots & p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    p_1 & p_1 & p_1 \\cdot p_2 & p_1 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    p_1^2 & p_1^2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2 & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^2 \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\\\\\n    p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2 & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^2 & \\dots & p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\\\\\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    So the number of divisors is trivially $(e_1 + 1) \\cdot (e_2 + 1)$.\n\n    * A similar argument can be made if there are more then two distinct prime factors.\n\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long numberOfDivisors(long long num) {\n        long long total = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {\n            if (num % i == 0) {\n                int e = 0;\n                do {\n                    e++;\n                    num /= i;\n                } while (num % i == 0);\n                total *= e + 1;\n            }\n        }\n        if (num > 1) {\n            total *= 2;\n        }\n        return total;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Sum of divisors\n\n    We can use the same argument of the previous section.\n\n    * If there is only one distinct prime divisor $n = p_1^{e_1}$, then the sum is:\n\n    $$1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\dots + p_1^{e_1} = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1}$$\n\n    * If there are two distinct prime divisors $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then we can make the same table as before.\n      The only difference is that now we now want to compute the sum instead of counting the elements.\n      It is easy to see, that the sum of each combination can be expressed as:\n\n    $$\\left(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\dots + p_1^{e_1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\dots + p_2^{e_2}\\right)$$\n\n    $$ = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \\cdot \\frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1}$$\n\n    * In general, for $n = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ we receive the formula:\n\n    $$\\sigma(n) = \\frac{p_1^{e_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1} \\cdot \\frac{p_2^{e_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1} \\cdots \\frac{p_k^{e_k + 1} - 1}{p_k - 1}$$\n\n    ```cpp\n    long long SumOfDivisors(long long num) {\n        long long total = 1;\n\n        for (int i = 2; (long long)i * i <= num; i++) {\n            if (num % i == 0) {\n                int e = 0;\n                do {\n                    e++;\n                    num /= i;\n                } while (num % i == 0);\n\n                long long sum = 0, pow = 1;\n                do {\n                    sum += pow;\n                    pow *= i;\n                } while (e-- > 0);\n                total *= sum;\n            }\n        }\n        if (num > 1) {\n            total *= (1 + num);\n        }\n        return total;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Multiplicative functions\n\n    A multiplicative function is a function $f(x)$ which satisfies\n\n    $$f(a \\cdot b) = f(a) \\cdot f(b)$$\n\n    if $a$ and $b$ are coprime.\n\n    Both $d(n)$ and $\\sigma(n)$ are multiplicative functions.\n\n    Multiplicative functions have a huge variety of interesting properties, which can be very useful in number theory problems.\n    For instance the Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is also multiplicative.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
