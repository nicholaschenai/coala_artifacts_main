    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English**: \n   We need to create a function that takes two sorted arrays and an integer `k`, and returns the k-th smallest element from the combined elements of both arrays.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English**: \n   To find the k-th smallest element from two sorted arrays, we can use a two-pointer technique. We will maintain two pointers, one for each array, and compare the elements at these pointers. We will increment the pointer of the array that has the smaller element and keep track of how many elements we have seen so far. Once we reach the k-th element, we return that element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution**:\n   ```\n   function find_kth(array1, array2, k):\n       initialize pointer1 to 0\n       initialize pointer2 to 0\n       while k > 0:\n           if pointer1 is at the end of array1:\n               return array2[pointer2 + k - 1]\n           if pointer2 is at the end of array2:\n               return array1[pointer1 + k - 1]\n           if array1[pointer1] is less than array2[pointer2]:\n               increment pointer1\n           else:\n               increment pointer2\n           decrement k\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments**:\n```python\ndef find_kth(array1, array2, k):\n    # Initialize pointers for both arrays\n    pointer1 = 0\n    pointer2 = 0\n    \n    # Loop until we find the k-th element\n    while k > 0:\n        # If pointer1 has reached the end of array1\n        if pointer1 == len(array1):\n            return array2[pointer2 + k - 1]\n        # If pointer2 has reached the end of array2\n        if pointer2 == len(array2):\n            return array1[pointer1 + k - 1]\n        \n        # Compare elements at both pointers\n        if array1[pointer1] < array2[pointer2]:\n            # Move pointer1 forward\n            pointer1 += 1\n        else:\n            # Move pointer2 forward\n            pointer2 += 1\n        \n        # Decrement k as we have found one more element\n        k -= 1\n```",
