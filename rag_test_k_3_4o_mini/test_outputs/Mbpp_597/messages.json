Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Amortized analysis\n    Section: Two pointers method\n    Part: 1/2\n

  what loops does the algorithm contain\n    and how many times the loops are performed.\n    However, sometimes a straightforward analysis\n    does not give a true picture of the efficiency of the

the \\key{two pointers method},\n    two pointers are used to\n    iterate through the array values.\n    Both pointers can move to one direction only,\n    which ensures that the algorithm works efficiently.\n    Next we discuss two problems that can be solved\n    using the two pointers method.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Subarray sum}\n\n    As the first example,\n    consider a problem where we are\n    given an array of $n$ positive integers\n    and a target sum $x$,\n    and we want to find a subarray whose sum is $x$\n    or report that there is no such subarray.\n\n    For example, the array\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n

  contains a subarray whose sum is 8:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (2,0) rectangle (5,1);\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    This problem can be solved in\n    $O(n)$ time by using the two pointers method.\n    The idea is to maintain pointers that point to the\n    first and last value of a subarray.\n    On each turn, the left pointer moves one step\n    to the right, and the right pointer moves to the right\n    as long as the resulting subarray sum is at most $x$.\n    If the sum becomes exactly $x$,\n    a solution has been found.\n\n    As an example, consider the following array\n    and a target sum $x=8$:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$2$};\n    \\node at

initial subarray contains the values\n    1, 3 and 2 whose sum is 6:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (0,0) rectangle (3,1);\n    \\draw (0,0)

\\end{center}\n\n    Then, the left pointer moves one step to the right.\n    The right pointer does not move, because otherwise\n    the subarray sum would exceed $x$.\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (3,1);\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$3$};\n    \\node at

right pointer moves three\n    steps to the right.\n    The subarray sum is $2+5+1=8$, so a subarray\n    whose sum is $x$ has been found.\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n

\\draw[thick,->] (4.5,-0.7) -- (4.5,-0.1);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    The running time of the algorithm depends on\n    the number of steps the right pointer moves.\n    While there is no useful upper bound on how many steps the\n    pointer can move on a \\emph{single} turn.\n    we know that the pointer moves \\emph{a total of}\n    $O(n)$ steps during the algorithm,\n    because it only moves to the right.\n\n    Since both the left and right pointer\n    move $O(n)$ steps during the algorithm,\n    the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    \\subsubsection{2SUM problem}\n\n    \\index{2SUM problem}\n\n    Another problem that can be solved using\n    the two pointers method is the following problem,\n    also known as the \\key{2SUM problem}:\n    given an array of $n$ numbers and\n    a target sum $x$, find\n    two array values such that their sum is $x$,\n    or report that no such values exist.\n\n    To solve the problem, we first\n    sort the array values in increasing order.\n    After that, we iterate through the array using\n    two pointers.\n    The left pointer starts at the first value\n    and moves one step to the right on each turn.\n    The right pointer begins at the last value\n    and always moves to the left until the sum of the\n    left and right value is at most $x$.\n    If the sum is exactly $x$,\n    a solution has been found.\n\n    For example, consider the following array\n    and a target sum $x=12$:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$10$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    The initial positions of the pointers\n    are as follows.\n    The sum of the values is $1+10=11$\n    that is smaller than $x$.\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (0,0) rectangle (1,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (7,0) rectangle (8,1);\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at (0.5,0.5) {$1$};\n    \\node at (1.5,0.5) {$4$};\n    \\node at (2.5,0.5) {$5$};\n    \\node at (3.5,0.5) {$6$};\n    \\node at (4.5,0.5) {$7$};\n    \\node at (5.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (6.5,0.5) {$9$};\n    \\node at (7.5,0.5) {$10$};\n\n    \\draw[thick,->] (0.5,-0.7) -- (0.5,-0.1);\n    \\draw[thick,->] (7.5,-0.7) -- (7.5,-0.1);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Then the left pointer moves one step to the right.\n    The right pointer moves three steps to the left,\n    and the sum becomes $4+7=11$.\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (1,0) rectangle (2,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (4,0) rectangle (5,1);\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node

Material]:\n    Chapter: Data structures\n    Section: Comparison to sorting\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Comparison to sorting}\n\n    It is often possible to solve a problem\n    using either data structures or sorting.\n    Sometimes there are remarkable differences\n    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,\n    which may be hidden in their time complexities.\n\n    Let us consider a problem where\n    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$\n    that both contain $n$ elements.\n    Our task is to calculate the number of elements\n    that belong to both of the lists.\n    For example, for the lists\n    \\[A = [5,2,8,9] \\hspace{10px} \\textrm{and} \\hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\\]\n    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5\n    and 9 belong to both of the lists.\n\n    A straightforward solution to the problem is\n    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,\n    but next we will focus on\n    more efficient algorithms.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,\n    and after this, we iterate through the elements\n    of $B$ and check for each elements if it\n    also belongs to $A$.\n    This is efficient because the elements of $A$\n    are in a set.\n    Using the \\texttt{set} structure,\n    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,\n    so instead of the \\texttt{set} structure\n    we can also use the \\texttt{unordered\\_set} structure.\n    This is an easy way to make the algorithm\n    more efficient, because we only have to change\n    the underlying data structure.\n    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 3}\n\n    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.\n    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.\n    After this, we iterate through both the lists\n    at the same time and find the common elements.\n    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,\n    so the total time complexity is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    The following table shows how efficient\n    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and\n    the elements of the lists are random\n    integers between $1 \\ldots 10^9$:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\\\\n    $2 \\cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\\\\n    $3 \\cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\\\\n    $4 \\cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\\\\n    $5 \\cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that\n    they use different set structures.\n    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on\n    the running time, because Algorithm 2\n    is 4\u20135 times faster than Algorithm 1.\n\n    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3\n    which uses sorting.\n    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.\n    Interestingly, the time complexity of both\n    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.\n    This can be explained by the fact that\n    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done\n    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.\n    On the other hand,\n    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree\n    during the whole algorithm.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

We will maintain two pointers, one for each array, and compare the elements at these pointers.

        "content": "Let's analyze the previous solution step-by-step to identify the issues:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the k-th smallest element from two sorted arrays. The provided example indicates that when combining the two arrays, the 5th smallest element should be returned.\n\n2. **Logic of the Previous Code**: The code uses a two-pointer technique to traverse both arrays. It increments the pointer of the array with the smaller current element and decrements `k` until it reaches zero. However, there are a few issues:\n   - The code does not correctly handle the case when `k` is equal to the total number of elements in both arrays. It should return the last element in that case.\n   - The logic for returning the k-th element is flawed. The current implementation assumes that the k-th element can be directly accessed by the pointer positions, which is incorrect.\n\n3. **Where I Went Wrong**: \n   - The condition to return the k-th element when one of the pointers reaches the end of its respective array is not correctly implemented. The code should ensure that it correctly calculates the index based on the remaining elements in the other array.\n   - The decrement of `k` and the movement of pointers need to be carefully managed to ensure that we are correctly counting the elements seen so far.\n\nTo fix the code, I will revise the logic to ensure that we correctly track the number of elements processed and return the correct k-th element based on the pointers' positions. \n\nHere\u2019s the revised plan:\n- Use a loop to iterate until we find the k-th element.\n- Compare the current elements pointed to by both pointers.\n- Move the pointer of the smaller element and decrement `k`.\n- If one pointer reaches the end of its array, return the k-th element from the other array.\n\nNow, I will implement the corrected solution. \n\n```python\ndef find_kth(array1, array2, k):\n    # Initialize pointers for both arrays\n    pointer1 = 0\n    pointer2 = 0\n    \n    # Loop until we find the k-th element\n    while True:\n        # If pointer1 has reached the end of array1\n        if pointer1 == len(array1):\n            return array2[pointer2 + k - 1]\n        # If pointer2 has reached the end of array2\n        if pointer2 == len(array2):\n            return array1[pointer1 + k - 1]\n        \n        # If we are looking for the first element\n        if k == 1:\n            return min(array1[pointer1], array2[pointer2])\n        \n        # Calculate the new positions to compare\n        new_index1 = min(pointer1 + k // 2 - 1, len(array1) - 1)\n        new_index2 = min(pointer2 + k // 2 - 1, len(array2) - 1)\n        \n        # Compare elements at the new indices\n        if array1[new_index1] < array2[new_index2]:\n            # Move pointer1 forward\n            k -= (new_index1 - pointer1 + 1)\n            pointer1 = new_index1 + 1\n        else:\n            # Move pointer2 forward\n            k -= (new_index2 - pointer2 + 1)\n            pointer2 = new_index2 + 1\n```"

Using a [Segment Tree](/data_structures/segment_tree.html), we can improve it to $O(n \\log n)$.\n    We want something better though.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(n)$ solution\n\n    We will try to find a pattern expressing the answer for the problem $J_{n, k}$ through the solution of the previous problems.\n\n    Using brute force modeling we can construct a table of values, for example, the following:\n\n    $$\\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}\n    n\\setminus k & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\\\\n    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n    2 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n    3 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 & 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n    4 & 4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n    5 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n    6 & 6 & 5 & 1 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n    7 & 7 & 7 & 4 & 2 & 6 & 3 & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\\\\n    8 & 8 & 1 & 7 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n    9 & 9 & 3 & 1 & 1 & 8 & 7 & 2 & 3 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n    10 & 10 & 5 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 3 & 9 & 1 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n    \\end{array}$$\n\n    And here we can clearly see the following **pattern**:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = \\left( (J_{n-1,k} + k - 1) \\bmod n \\right) + 1$$\n\n    $$J_{1,k} = 1$$\n\n    Here, 1-indexing makes for a somewhat messy formula; if you instead number the positions from 0, you get a very elegant formula:\n\n    $$J_{n,k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\bmod n$$\n\n    So, we found a solution to the problem of Josephus, working in $O(n)$ operations.\n\n    ## Implementation\n\n    Simple **recursive implementation** (in 1-indexing)\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_rec}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        return n > 1 ? (josephus(n-1, k) + k - 1) % n + 1 : 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    **Non-recursive form** :\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_iter}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        int res = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)\n      \t  res = (res + k) % i;\n        return res + 1;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This formula can also be found analytically.\n    Again here we assume 0-indexing.\n    After we delete the first number, we have $n-1$ numbers left.\n    When we repeat the procedure, we will start with the number that had originally the index $k \\bmod n$.\n    $J_{n-1, k}$ would be the answer for the remaining circle, if we start counting at $0$, but because we actually start with $k$ we have $J_{n, k} = (J_{n-1,k} + k) \\ \\bmod n$.\n\n    ## Modeling a $O(k \\log n)$ solution\n\n    For relatively small $k$ we can come up with a better solution than the above recursive solution in $O(n)$.\n    If $k$ is a lot smaller than $n$, then we can delete multiple numbers ($\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$) in one run without looping over.\n    Afterwards we have $n - \\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor$ numbers left, and we start with the $(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k)$-th number.\n    So we have to shift by that many.\n    We can notice that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{k} \\rfloor \\cdot k$ is simply $-n \\bmod k$.\n    And because we removed every $k$-th number, we have to add the number of numbers that we removed before the result index.\n    Which we can compute by dividing the result index by $k - 1$.\n\n    Also, we need to handle the case when $n$ becomes less than $k$. In this case, the above optimization would cause an infinite loop.\n\n    **Implementation** (for convenience in 0-indexing):\n\n    ```{.cpp file=josephus_fast0}\n    int josephus(int n, int k) {\n        if (n == 1)\n            return 0;\n        if (k == 1)\n            return n-1;\n        if (k > n)\n            return (josephus(n-1, k) + k) % n;\n        int cnt = n / k;\n        int res = josephus(n - cnt, k);\n        res -= n % k;\n        if (res < 0)\n            res += n;\n        else\n            res += res / (k - 1);\n        return res;\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Let us estimate the **complexity** of this algorithm. Immediately note that the case $n < k$ is analyzed by the old solution, which will work in this case for $O(k)$. Now consider the algorithm itself. In fact, after every iteration, instead of $n$ numbers, we are left with $n \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$ numbers, so the total number of iterations $x$ of the algorithm can be found roughly from the following equation:\n\n    $$ n \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) ^ x = 1, $$\n\n    on taking logarithm on both sides, we obtain:\n\n    $$\\ln n + x \\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = 0,$$ \n    $$x = - \\frac{\\ln n}{\\ln \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k} \\right)},$$\n\n    using the decomposition of the logarithm into Taylor series, we obtain an approximate estimate:\n\n    $$x \\approx k \\ln n$$\n\n    Thus, the complexity of the algorithm is actually $O (k \\log n)$.\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k = 2$\n\n    In this particular case (in which this task was set by Josephus Flavius) the problem is solved much easier.\n\n    In the case of even $n$ we get that all even numbers will be crossed out, and then there will be a problem remaining for $\\frac{n}{2}$, then the answer for $n$ will be obtained from the answer for $\\frac{n}{2}$ by multiplying by two and subtracting one (by shifting positions):\n\n    $$ J_{2n, 2} = 2 J_{n, 2} - 1 $$\n\n    Similarly, in the case of an odd $n$, all even numbers will be crossed out, then the first number, and the problem for $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ will remain, and taking into account the shift of positions, we obtain the second formula:\n\n    $$J_{2n+1,2} = 2 J_{n, 2} + 1 $$\n\n    We can use this recurrent dependency directly in our implementation. This pattern can be translated into another form: $J_{n, 2}$ represents a sequence of all odd numbers, \"restarting\" from one whenever $n$ turns out to be a power of two. This can be written as a single formula:\n\n    $$J_{n, 2} = 1 + 2 \\left(n-2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor} \\right)$$\n\n    ## Analytical solution for $k > 2$\n\n    Despite the simple form of the problem and a large number of articles on this and related problems, a simple analytical representation of the solution of Josephus' problem has not yet been found. For small $k$, some formulas are derived, but apparently they are all difficult to apply in practice (for example, see Halbeisen, Hungerbuhler \"The Josephus Problem\" and Odlyzko, Wilf \"Functional iteration and the Josephus problem\").\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n\n[Textbook Reference Material]:\n    Chapter: Amortized analysis\n    Section: Two pointers method\n    Part: 1/2\n

there is no useful upper bound on how many steps the\n    pointer can move on a \\emph{single} turn.\n    we know that the pointer moves \\emph{a total of}\n    $O(n)$ steps during the algorithm,\n    because it only moves to the right.\n\n    Since both the left and right pointer\n    move $O(n)$ steps during the algorithm,\n    the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time.\n\n    \\subsubsection{2SUM problem}\n\n    \\index{2SUM problem}\n\n    Another problem that can be solved using\n    the two pointers method is the following problem,\n    also known as the \\key{2SUM problem}:\n    given an array of $n$ numbers and\n    a target sum $x$, find\n    two array values such that their sum is $x$,\n    or report that no such values exist.\n\n    To solve the problem, we first\n    sort the array values in increasing order.\n    After that, we iterate through the array using\n    two pointers.\n    The left pointer starts at the first value\n    and moves one step to the right on each turn.\n    The right pointer begins at the last value\n    and always moves to the left until the sum of the\n    left and right value is at most $x$.\n    If the sum is exactly $x$,\n    a solution has been found.\n\n    For example, consider the following array\n    and a target sum $x=12$:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\draw (0,0) grid (8,1);\n\n    \\node at

   that is smaller than $x$.\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (0,0) rectangle (1,1);\n    \\fill[color=lightgray] (7,0) rectangle (8,1);\n

\\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Then the left pointer moves one step to the right.\n    The right pointer moves three steps to the left,\n    and the sum becomes $4+7=11$.\n\n

Material]:\n    Chapter: Data structures\n    Section: Comparison to sorting\n    Part: 1/1\n    \\section{Comparison to sorting}\n\n    It is often possible to solve a problem\n    using either data structures or sorting.\n    Sometimes there are remarkable differences\n    in the actual efficiency of these approaches,\n    which may be hidden in their time complexities.\n\n    Let us consider a problem where\n    we are given two lists $A$ and $B$\n    that both contain $n$ elements.\n    Our task is to calculate the number of elements\n    that belong to both of the lists.\n    For example, for the lists\n    \\[A = [5,2,8,9] \\hspace{10px} \\textrm{and} \\hspace{10px} B = [3,2,9,5],\\]\n    the answer is 3 because the numbers 2, 5\n    and 9 belong to both of the lists.\n\n    A straightforward solution to the problem is\n    to go through all pairs of elements in $O(n^2)$ time,\n    but next we will focus on\n    more efficient algorithms.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 1}\n\n    We construct a set of the elements that appear in $A$,\n    and after this, we iterate through the elements\n    of $B$ and check for each elements if it\n    also belongs to $A$.\n    This is efficient because the elements of $A$\n    are in a set.\n    Using the \\texttt{set} structure,\n    the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 2}\n\n    It is not necessary to maintain an ordered set,\n    so instead of the \\texttt{set} structure\n    we can also use the \\texttt{unordered\\_set} structure.\n    This is an easy way to make the algorithm\n    more efficient, because we only have to change\n    the underlying data structure.\n    The time complexity of the new algorithm is $O(n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Algorithm 3}\n\n    Instead of data structures, we can use sorting.\n    First, we sort both lists $A$ and $B$.\n    After this, we iterate through both the lists\n    at the same time and find the common elements.\n    The time complexity of sorting is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in $O(n)$ time,\n    so the total time complexity is $O(n \\log n)$.\n\n    \\subsubsection{Efficiency comparison}\n\n    The following table shows how efficient\n    the above algorithms are when $n$ varies and\n    the elements of the lists are random\n    integers between $1 \\ldots 10^9$:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{rrrr}\n    $n$ & Algorithm 1 & Algorithm 2 & Algorithm 3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    $10^6$ & $1.5$ s & $0.3$ s & $0.2$ s \\\\\n    $2 \\cdot 10^6$ & $3.7$ s & $0.8$ s & $0.3$ s \\\\\n    $3 \\cdot 10^6$ & $5.7$ s & $1.3$ s & $0.5$ s \\\\\n    $4 \\cdot 10^6$ & $7.7$ s & $1.7$ s & $0.7$ s \\\\\n    $5 \\cdot 10^6$ & $10.0$ s & $2.3$ s & $0.9$ s \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    Algorithms 1 and 2 are equal except that\n    they use different set structures.\n    In this problem, this choice has an important effect on\n    the running time, because Algorithm 2\n    is 4\u20135 times faster than Algorithm 1.\n\n    However, the most efficient algorithm is Algorithm 3\n    which uses sorting.\n    It only uses half the time compared to Algorithm 2.\n    Interestingly, the time complexity of both\n    Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 is $O(n \\log n)$,\n    but despite this, Algorithm 3 is ten times faster.\n    This can be explained by the fact that\n    sorting is a simple procedure and it is done\n    only once at the beginning of Algorithm 3,\n    and the rest of the algorithm works in linear time.\n    On the other hand,\n    Algorithm 1 maintains a complex balanced binary tree\n    during the whole algorithm.\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"
