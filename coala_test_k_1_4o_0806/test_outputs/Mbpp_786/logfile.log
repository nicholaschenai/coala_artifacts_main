INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/786 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that finds the right insertion point for a given value in a sorted list. The right insertion point is the index at which the value can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of the list. If the value is already present in the list, the insertion point should be after the last occurrence of that value.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We are given a sorted list and a value.
2. We need to find the index where the value can be inserted such that the list remains sorted.
3. If the value is already present in the list, we should find the position after the last occurrence of that value.
4. We can iterate through the list and find the first position where the current element is greater than the given value. This position will be the right insertion point.
5. If we reach the end of the list without finding such a position, the right insertion point is the length of the list.

## Pseudocode

```
function right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    for index from 0 to length of sorted_list - 1:
        if sorted_list[index] > value:
            return index
    return length of sorted_list
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    # Iterate through the list to find the right insertion point
    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):
        # If the current element is greater than the value, return the current index
        if sorted_list[index] > value:
            return index
    # If no such element is found, return the length of the list
    return len(sorted_list)
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, we were tasked with finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for paths in a tree from a root vertex to every other vertex. The core concepts involved include tree traversal, pathfinding in trees, and efficient LIS calculation using dynamic programming with binary search.

    ### Key Concepts and Strategies

    1. **Tree Representation**: The tree was represented using an adjacency list, which is efficient for traversal operations like DFS or BFS. This representation is crucial for efficiently finding paths in a tree structure.

    2. **Pathfinding in Trees**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path from the root to any vertex is unique. We used Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and maintain the path from the root to each vertex.

    3. **LIS Calculation**: The LIS was calculated using a dynamic programming approach with binary search, which is efficient with a time complexity of `O(L log L)`, where `L` is the length of the sequence. This method involves maintaining a list that stores the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences of different lengths.

    ### Challenges and Solutions

    - **Input Handling**: Initially, the code did not execute because the `main()` function was not called. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by explicitly calling `main()` at the end of the script.

    - **Output Format**: Ensuring the output was printed correctly, with each LIS length on a new line, was crucial for passing the tests.

    ### Code Snippet

    Here's the core function for calculating the LIS, which was central to solving the problem:

    ```python
    def calculate_lis(sequence):
        if not sequence:
            return 0
    
        lis = []
        for value in sequence:
            low, high = 0, len(lis)
            while low < high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if lis[mid] < value:
                    low = mid + 1
                else:
                    high = mid
            if low == len(lis):
                lis.append(value)
            else:
                lis[low] = value
    
        return len(lis)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of efficient data structures and algorithms for pathfinding and subsequence problems, especially in large datasets.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/786 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that finds the position where a given value should be inserted in a sorted list to maintain the order. The function should return the index where the value would go if it were inserted at the end of any existing equal values.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the right insertion point for a value in a sorted list, we can iterate through the list and compare each element with the given value. We continue this until we find an element that is greater than the given value. The index of this element is the right insertion point. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, the insertion point is at the end of the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
       for index from 0 to length of sorted_list:
           if sorted_list[index] is greater than value:
               return index
       return length of sorted_list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def right_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    # Iterate over the list to find the right insertion point
    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):
        # If the current element is greater than the value, return the current index

            return index
    # If no such element is found, return the length of the list
    return len(sorted_list)
