INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/554 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through each integer in the input list.
2. For each integer, we will check if it is odd. An integer is odd if the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero.
3. If the integer is odd, we will add it to a new list.
4. Finally, we will return the new list containing only the odd integers.

### Pseudocode

```
function Split(numbers):
    create an empty list called odd_numbers
    for each number in numbers:
        if number is odd (number % 2 != 0):
            add number to odd_numbers
    return odd_numbers
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def Split(numbers):
    # Create an empty list to store odd numbers
    odd_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is odd
        if number % 2 != 0:
            # Add the odd number to the odd_numbers list
            odd_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the list of odd numbers
    return odd_numbers

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays (subsequences of consecutive elements) in `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. 

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify the positions of odd numbers in the array. This will help us in determining the subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

        2. **Use Two Pointers**: We can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. The idea is to maintain a window that contains exactly `k` odd numbers and count the number of such windows.

        3. **Count Subarrays**: For each valid window (subarray) that contains exactly `k` odd numbers, we can extend the window to the left and right to count all possible subarrays that still contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

        4. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the array, adjusting the window size using the two pointers, and count the number of valid subarrays.

        ## Pseudocode

        1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start of the array.
        2. Initialize a counter `odd_count` to count the number of odd numbers in the current window.
        3. Initialize a variable `result` to store the number of nice subarrays.
        4. Iterate `right` over the array:
           - If `nums[right]` is odd, increment `odd_count`.
           - While `odd_count` is greater than `k`, increment `left` and decrement `odd_count` if `nums[left]` is odd.
           - If `odd_count` equals `k`, count the number of subarrays ending at `right` with exactly `k` odd numbers.
        5. Return `result`.

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
                def count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k):
                    left = 0
                    odd_count = 0
                    result = 0
                    for right in range(len(nums)):
                        if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                            odd_count += 1
                        while odd_count > k:
                            if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                                odd_count -= 1
                            left += 1
                        result += right - left + 1
                    return result
        
                # The number of subarrays with exactly k odd numbers is the difference
                # between the number of subarrays with at most k odd numbers and the
                # number of subarrays with at most k-1 odd numbers.
                return count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k) - count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k - 1)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - The function `count_at_most_k_odd` calculates the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers using a sliding window approach.
        - The main function `numberOfSubarrays` calculates the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by subtracting the number of subarrays with at most `k-1` odd numbers from the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers. This is based on the principle that the difference gives us the exact count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers.
