    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each integer in the input list. For each integer, we will check if it is odd. If it is odd, we will add it to a new list. Finally, we will return this new list containing only the odd numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named Split that takes a list of integers as input.\n   Initialize an empty list to store odd numbers.\n   For each integer in the input list:\n       Check if the integer is odd (i.e., integer % 2 is not equal to 0).\n       If it is odd, append it to the list of odd numbers.\n   Return the list of odd numbers.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Split(numbers):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store odd numbers\n    odd_numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            # If it is odd, append it to the list of odd numbers\n            odd_numbers.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of odd numbers\n    return odd_numbers\n```",
