INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/61 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that counts the number of substrings in a given string of digits where the sum of the digits in each substring is equal to the length of that substring.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Iterate through all possible substrings**: We will generate all possible substrings of the input string. For a string of length `n`, there are `n(n+1)/2` possible substrings.

2. **Calculate the sum of digits and length for each substring**: For each substring, calculate the sum of its digits and compare it to the length of the substring.

3. **Count valid substrings**: If the sum of the digits equals the length of the substring, increment a counter.

4. **Return the count**: After checking all substrings, return the count of valid substrings.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_Substrings(s):
    initialize count to 0
    for each starting index i from 0 to length of s - 1:
        initialize sum_of_digits to 0
        for each ending index j from i to length of s - 1:
            add integer value of s[j] to sum_of_digits
            if sum_of_digits equals (j - i + 1):
                increment count
    return count
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_Substrings(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize the count of valid substrings
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each possible starting index of the substring
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Initialize the sum of digits for the current starting index
        sum_of_digits = 0
        
        # Iterate over each possible ending index of the substring
        for j in range(i, len(s)):
            # Add the current digit to the sum
            sum_of_digits += int(s[j])
            
            # Calculate the length of the current substring
            length_of_substring = j - i + 1
            
            # Check if the sum of digits equals the length of the substring
            if sum_of_digits == length_of_substring:
                # Increment the count if the condition is met
                count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of valid substrings
    return count
```

This solution iterates through all possible substrings, calculates the sum of digits for each, and checks if it matches the length of the substring. It efficiently counts and returns the number of valid substrings.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.
    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.

    ### Strategy:
    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.
    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.
    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            prefix_sums = {0: 1}
            current_sum = 0
            count = 0
        
            for num in nums:
                current_sum += num
                needed_sum = current_sum - k
                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:
                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]
                if current_sum in prefix_sums:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
                else:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1
        
            return count
    ```

    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.
