INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/57 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create the largest possible number by rearranging the digits in a given list. The digits are provided as integers in the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To form the largest number, we should arrange the digits in descending order. This means sorting the list of digits from the largest to the smallest. Once sorted, we can concatenate these digits to form the final number.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `find_Max_Num` that takes a list of integers `digits`.
   - Sort the list `digits` in descending order.
   - Convert each digit in the sorted list to a string.
   - Concatenate these string representations to form a single string.
   - Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.
   - Return the resulting integer.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_Max_Num(digits):
    # Step 1: Sort the digits in descending order
    sorted_digits = sorted(digits, reverse=True)
    
    # Step 2: Convert each digit to a string and concatenate them
    max_num_str = ''.join(str(digit) for digit in sorted_digits)
    
    # Step 3: Convert the concatenated string back to an integer
    max_num = int(max_num_str)
    
    # Step 4: Return the resulting integer
    return max_num
```

This function will take a list of digits, sort them in descending order, concatenate them into a string, convert that string to an integer, and return the largest possible number that can be formed from the given digits.

    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.

    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.

    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            if not nums:
                return 0
        
            n = len(nums)
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/57 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of digits and returns the largest number that can be formed by arranging these digits.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To form the largest number from a list of digits, we should arrange the digits in descending order. This way, the largest digits are placed in the most significant positions. Once sorted, we can concatenate these digits to form the final number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   - Define a function `find_Max_Num` that takes a list of digits as input.
   - Sort the list of digits in descending order.
   - Convert each digit to a string and concatenate them to form a single string.
   - Convert the concatenated string back to an integer to remove any leading zeros.
   - Return the resulting integer.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_Max_Num(digits):
    # Step 1: Sort the digits in descending order
    sorted_digits = sorted(digits, reverse=True)
    
    # Step 2: Convert each digit to a string and concatenate them

    max_num = int(max_num_str)
    
    # Step 4: Return the resulting integer
