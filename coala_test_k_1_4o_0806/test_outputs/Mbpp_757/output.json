    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of strings and counts how many pairs of strings are reverses of each other. For example, if one string is \"abc\" and another is \"cba\", they form a reverse pair.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each string in the list and check if its reverse exists in the list. We need to ensure that we only count each pair once. We can use a set to keep track of strings that have already been paired to avoid double counting.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a set to keep track of strings that have been paired.\n   Initialize a counter to zero for counting reverse pairs.\n   \n   For each string in the list:\n       If the string is not in the paired set:\n           Reverse the string.\n           If the reversed string is in the list and not in the paired set:\n               Increment the counter by 1.\n               Add both the string and its reverse to the paired set.\n   \n   Return the counter.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_reverse_pairs(strings: list) -> int:\n    # Set to keep track of strings that have been paired\n    paired = set()\n    # Counter for reverse pairs\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each string in the list\n    for string in strings:\n        # Check if the string is not already paired\n        if string not in paired:\n            # Reverse the string\n            reversed_string = string[::-1]\n            # Check if the reversed string is in the list and not already paired\n            if reversed_string in strings and reversed_string not in paired:\n                # Increment the counter for a found pair\n                count += 1\n                # Add both the string and its reverse to the paired set\n                paired.add(string)\n                paired.add(reversed_string)\n    \n    # Return the total count of reverse pairs\n    return count\n```",
