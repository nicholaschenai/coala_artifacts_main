Each tuple should contain a pair of consecutive items from the input list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input list and for each element (except the last one), create a tuple with the current element and the next element. We will collect all these tuples in a new list and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named pair_wise that takes a list as input.\n   Initialize an empty list called result to store the pairs.\n   Loop through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element:\n       Create a tuple with the current element and the next element.\n       Append this tuple to the result list.\n   Return the result list.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef pair_wise(lst):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the pairs\n    result = []\n    \n    # Loop through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element\n    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):\n        # Create a tuple with the current element and the next element\n        pair = (lst[i], lst[i + 1])\n        \n        # Append this tuple to the result list\n        result.append(pair)\n    \n    # Return the result list containing all pairs\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will iterate through the list, create pairs of consecutive elements, and return a list of these pairs."

The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.\n\n    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.\n\n    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\n    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:\n    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.\n    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.\n    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
