INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/733 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified number in a sorted list of numbers. The list is sorted in non-decreasing order, and we need to return the index of the first time the specified number appears in the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Since the list is sorted, we can take advantage of this property to efficiently find the first occurrence of the number.
   - We can iterate through the list from the beginning and check each element.
   - As soon as we find the number, we return its index.
   - If we reach the end of the list without finding the number, it means the number is not present, and we can return a special value like `-1` to indicate this.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_first_occurrence(arr, target):
       for index from 0 to length of arr - 1:
           if arr[index] is equal to target:
               return index
       return -1
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_first_occurrence(arr, target):
    # Iterate over each element in the array
    for index in range(len(arr)):
        # Check if the current element is equal to the target
        if arr[index] == target:
            # If found, return the current index
            return index
    # If the loop completes without finding the target, return -1
    return -1
```

This solution efficiently finds the first occurrence of the target number in a sorted list by leveraging a simple linear search, which is optimal given the sorted nature of the list.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to count the number of inversions in an array for multiple test cases. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices \(i, j\) such that \(i < j\) and \(arr[i] > arr[j]\). The challenge was to implement an efficient solution that could handle large arrays, given the constraints.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns

    The problem tests the understanding of inversion counting using a modified merge sort algorithm. This approach leverages the divide-and-conquer strategy to count inversions in \(O(N \log N)\) time, which is efficient for large inputs. The key insight is that during the merge step, if an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, it indicates inversions equal to the number of remaining elements in the left subarray.

    ### Strategies and Fixes

    Initially, the solution logic was correct, but the script failed to produce output because the `main()` function was not called. This was a simple oversight that was fixed by adding a conditional check to call `main()` when the script is executed directly. This is a common practice in Python to ensure that the script's main logic is executed only when it is run as the main program.

    ### Code Snippet

    Here's the key part of the solution that counts inversions using merge sort:

    ```python
    def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
        # Merging and counting inversions
        # ...

    def merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
        # Recursive merge sort and inversion counting
        # ...

    def count_inversions(arr):
        # Initialize and call merge_sort_and_count
        # ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that the main function is executed in scripts that rely on standard input/output, especially in competitive programming and testing environments.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/733 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified number in a sorted list of numbers. The list is sorted in non-decreasing order, and we need to return the index of the first time the number appears in the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Since the list is sorted, we can use a binary search approach to efficiently find the first occurrence of the number. The binary search will help us quickly narrow down the potential location of the number. Once we find the number, we will check if it is the first occurrence by ensuring that the number at the previous index (if it exists) is different. If it is the first occurrence, we return the index; otherwise, we continue searching in the left half of the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function find_first_occurrence(arr, target):
       Initialize low to 0
       Initialize high to length of arr - 1
       Initialize result to -1 (to store the index of the first occurrence)

       While low is less than or equal to high:
           Calculate mid as (low + high) // 2
           If arr[mid] is equal to target:
               Set result to mid
               Move high to mid - 1 to search for earlier occurrences
           Else if arr[mid] is less than target:
               Move low to mid + 1
           Else:

       Return result
