A tetrahedral number is a figurate number that represents a pyramid with a triangular base and three sides (a tetrahedron). The nth tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The nth tetrahedral number can be calculated using the formula: \n     \\[\n     T(n) = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1) \\times (n + 2)}{6}\n     \\]\n   - This formula comes from the fact that the nth tetrahedral number is the sum of the first n triangular numbers, and each triangular number can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first k natural numbers.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `tetrahedral_number(n)`.\n   - Calculate the nth tetrahedral number using the formula: \n     \\[\n     T(n) = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1) \\times (n + 2)}{6}\n     \\]\n   - Return the calculated value.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef tetrahedral_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth tetrahedral number using the formula:\n    # T(n) = n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 6\n    # This formula gives the sum of the first n triangular numbers.\n    return n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 6\n```\n\nThis function calculates the nth tetrahedral number using the derived formula, which efficiently computes the result in constant time."

However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:\n\n    1. **Formula Derivation**:\n       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.\n\n    2. **Handling the First Term**:\n       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**:\n       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.\n\n    4. **Code Simplicity**:\n       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.\n\n    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
