INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/274 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices in the expansion of `(x + y)^n`. The binomial coefficient at index `k` in this expansion is given by `C(n, k)`, which is the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Calculate the binomial coefficients for even indices from 0 to `n`.
   - Sum these coefficients.
   - Return the sum.

   The binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n-k)!}
   \]
   where `!` denotes factorial.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function factorial that calculates the factorial of a number.
   
   Define the main function even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):
       Initialize sum_even_coeff to 0
       For each even index k from 0 to n (inclusive):
           Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k) using the factorial function
           Add the binomial coefficient to sum_even_coeff
       Return sum_even_coeff
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
# Helper function to calculate factorial of a number
def factorial(num: int) -> int:
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, num + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Main function to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients
def even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    sum_even_coeff = 0
    # Iterate over even indices from 0 to n
    for k in range(0, n + 1, 2):
        # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)
        binomial_coeff = factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))
        # Add the binomial coefficient to the sum
        sum_even_coeff += binomial_coeff
    return sum_even_coeff
```

This code defines a helper function `factorial` to compute the factorial of a number, and the main function `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum` to compute the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a given `n`.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

    1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves combinatorial counting, specifically determining how many subsets of a set have a particular element at a specific position when sorted. This requires understanding binomial coefficients and powers of two.

    2. **Precomputation for Efficiency**: My approach involved precomputing factorials and their modular inverses to efficiently calculate binomial coefficients. This is crucial for handling large inputs efficiently, especially given the constraints.

    3. **Handling Edge Cases**: Both my solution and the official solution correctly handle the case where \(K > I\), which is impossible and should return 0.

    4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Both solutions correctly apply modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, which is a common requirement in competitive programming to prevent overflow and ensure results fit within standard data types.

    5. **Official Solution's Simplicity**: The official solution uses Python's `math.factorial` for direct computation of binomial coefficients, which is straightforward but may not be as efficient for very large inputs due to repeated calculations. My approach of precomputing factorials and inverses is more efficient for large-scale queries.

    6. **Function Call**: A key oversight in my initial solution was not calling the `solve()` function, which led to no output. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed.

    In summary, the problem reinforced the importance of efficient combinatorial calculations and careful handling of input/output in competitive programming. The official solution, while straightforward, could benefit from precomputation techniques for better performance on large inputs.

   We need to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices in the expansion of `(1 + x)^n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The binomial coefficients for `(1 + x)^n` are given by `C(n, k)` where `k` ranges from `0` to `n`. We need to sum the coefficients where `k` is even. A property of binomial coefficients is that the sum of coefficients at even indices is equal to the sum of coefficients at odd indices, and both are equal to `2^(n-1)`. Therefore, the sum of even index binomial coefficients is `2^(n-1)`.
