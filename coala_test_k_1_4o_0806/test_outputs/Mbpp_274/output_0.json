    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices in the expansion of `(1 + x)^n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The binomial coefficients for `(1 + x)^n` are given by `C(n, k)` where `k` ranges from `0` to `n`. We need to sum the coefficients where `k` is even. A property of binomial coefficients is that the sum of coefficients at even indices is equal to the sum of coefficients at odd indices, and both are equal to `2^(n-1)`. Therefore, the sum of even index binomial coefficients is `2^(n-1)`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n):\n       Return 2 raised to the power of (n-1)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef even_binomial_Coeff_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate 2 raised to the power of (n-1)\n    return 2 ** (n - 1)\n```\n\nThis solution leverages the property of binomial coefficients that the sum of coefficients at even indices is `2^(n-1)`. This is a direct and efficient way to compute the desired sum.",
