INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/119 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We are given a sorted array where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element that appears only once. Our task is to find and return this unique element.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Since the array is sorted, the elements that appear twice will be adjacent to each other.
2. We can iterate through the array in steps of 2, checking pairs of elements.
3. If a pair of elements are not equal, then the first element of that pair is the unique element.
4. If we reach the end of the array without finding a mismatch, the last element is the unique one.

## Pseudocode

```
function search(arr):
    for i from 0 to length of arr - 1, step by 2:
        if i is the last index or arr[i] is not equal to arr[i + 1]:
            return arr[i]
    return arr[length of arr - 1]
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def search(arr):
    # Iterate through the array in steps of 2
    for i in range(0, len(arr) - 1, 2):
        # If the current element is not equal to the next one, it is the unique element
        if arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:
            return arr[i]
    # If no unique element is found in the loop, the last element is unique
    return arr[-1]

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to count the number of inversions in an array for multiple test cases. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices \(i, j\) such that \(i < j\) and \(arr[i] > arr[j]\). The challenge was to implement an efficient solution that could handle large arrays, given the constraints.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns

    The problem tests the understanding of inversion counting using a modified merge sort algorithm. This approach leverages the divide-and-conquer strategy to count inversions in \(O(N \log N)\) time, which is efficient for large inputs. The key insight is that during the merge step, if an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, it indicates inversions equal to the number of remaining elements in the left subarray.

    ### Strategies and Fixes

    Initially, the solution logic was correct, but the script failed to produce output because the `main()` function was not called. This was a simple oversight that was fixed by adding a conditional check to call `main()` when the script is executed directly. This is a common practice in Python to ensure that the script's main logic is executed only when it is run as the main program.

    ### Code Snippet

    Here's the key part of the solution that counts inversions using merge sort:

    ```python
    def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
        # Merging and counting inversions
        # ...

    def merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
        # Recursive merge sort and inversion counting
        # ...

    def count_inversions(arr):
        # Initialize and call merge_sort_and_count
        # ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that the main function is executed in scripts that rely on standard input/output, especially in competitive programming and testing environments.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/119 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the single element in a sorted array where every other element appears exactly twice. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Since the array is sorted and all elements except one appear twice, the unique element will disrupt the pattern of pairs. We can iterate through the array and check pairs of elements. If a pair does not match, the unique element is the first element of that pair. If we reach the end of the array without finding a mismatch, the last element is the unique one.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function search(arr):
       for i from 0 to length of arr - 1, step by 2:
           if i is the last index or arr[i] is not equal to arr[i + 1]:
