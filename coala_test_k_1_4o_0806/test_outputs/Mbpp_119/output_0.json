    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the single element in a sorted array where every other element appears exactly twice. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Since the array is sorted and all elements except one appear twice, the unique element will disrupt the pattern of pairs. We can iterate through the array and check pairs of elements. If a pair does not match, the unique element is the first element of that pair. If we reach the end of the array without finding a mismatch, the last element is the unique one.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function search(arr):\n       for i from 0 to length of arr - 1, step by 2:\n           if i is the last index or arr[i] is not equal to arr[i + 1]:\n               return arr[i]\n       return arr[length of arr - 1]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef search(arr):\n    # Iterate over the array with a step of 2 to check pairs\n    for i in range(0, len(arr) - 1, 2):\n        # If the current element is not equal to the next one, it is the unique element\n        if arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:\n            return arr[i]\n    # If no unique element is found in pairs, the last element is the unique one\n    return arr[-1]\n```",
