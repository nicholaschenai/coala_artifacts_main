INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/413 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `n` as inputs. The function should return a list containing the `n`-th element from each tuple in the list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, we will extract the element at the index `n`.
   - We will collect these elements into a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function extract_nth_element with parameters list_of_tuples and n
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each tuple in list_of_tuples
           Append the element at index n of the tuple to result
       Return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def extract_nth_element(list_of_tuples, n):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the nth elements
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for tuple_item in list_of_tuples:
        # Append the nth element of the current tuple to the result list
        result.append(tuple_item[n])
    
    # Return the list of nth elements
    return result
```

This function will correctly extract the `n`-th element from each tuple in the provided list and return a list of these elements.

    [Task]:
        The Fibonacci sequence $F_0, F_1, \ldots$ is a special infinite sequence of non-negative integers, where $F_0 = 0$, $F_1 = 1$ and for each integer $n \ge 2$, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$.
        Consider the sequence $D$ of the last decimal digits of the first $N$ Fibonacci numbers, i.e. $D = (F_0 \% 10, F_1 \% 10, \ldots, F_{N-1} \% 10)$. Now, you should perform the following process:
        - Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_l)$.
        - If $l = 1$, the process ends.
        - Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \ldots, D_{2 \lfloor l/2 \rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.
        - Change $D$ to $E$.
        When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.

        -----Input-----
        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
        - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.

        -----Output-----
        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€• the last remaining number.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

        -----Subtasks-----
        Subtask #1 (20 points):
        - $1 \le T \le 10^5$
        - $1 \le N \le 10^7$
        Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints

        -----Example Input-----
        1
        9

        -----Example Output-----
        3

        -----Explanation-----
        Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (3)$.

        ### Analysis of the Problem

        The issue seems to be related to the way the code is structured, particularly with the input and output handling. The function `solve()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads input and produces output is never executed. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that rely on standard input and output.

        ### Step-by-Step Correction

        1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.

        2. **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the results are stored in a list. Each result is then printed in sequence.

        3. **Output Handling**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

        ### Corrected Python Code

        ```python
        def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):
            # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers
            last_digits = [0, 1]
            for i in range(2, 60):
                last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)
    
            # Find the position in the cycle
            position = n % 60
    
            # Simulate the reduction process
            sequence = last_digits[:position]
            while len(sequence) > 1:
                sequence = sequence[1::2]  # Keep only even-indexed elements (1-based)
    
            return sequence[0]

        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            results = []
    
            for i in range(1, T + 1):
                N = int(data[i])
                result = last_digit_of_fibonacci(N)
                results.append(result)
    
            for res in results:
                print(res)

        # Call the solve function to execute the solution
        solve()
        ```

        ### Explanation of Corrections

        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.
        - **Input and Output**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, and the results are stored in a list. Each result is printed in sequence after processing all test cases.

        This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now executed properly.
