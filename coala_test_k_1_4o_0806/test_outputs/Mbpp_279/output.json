    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth decagonal number. A decagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the decagon (a ten-sided polygon). The nth decagonal number can be calculated using a specific formula.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth decagonal number, we can use the formula for decagonal numbers: \n   \\[\n   D_n = 4n^2 - 3n\n   \\]\n   This formula allows us to directly compute the nth decagonal number by substituting the value of n into the formula.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function is_num_decagonal(n):\n       Calculate the nth decagonal number using the formula: D_n = 4 * n^2 - 3 * n\n       Return the calculated decagonal number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_num_decagonal(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth decagonal number using the formula: D_n = 4 * n^2 - 3 * n\n    decagonal_number = 4 * n * n - 3 * n\n    # Return the calculated decagonal number\n    return decagonal_number\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth decagonal number by applying the formula \\(D_n = 4n^2 - 3n\\).",
