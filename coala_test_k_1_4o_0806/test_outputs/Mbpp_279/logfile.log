INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/279 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to write a function that calculates the nth decagonal number. A decagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the decagon (a ten-sided polygon). The formula for the nth decagonal number is given by:

\[ D_n = 4n^2 - 3n \]

where \( n \) is the position in the sequence.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To find the nth decagonal number:
- Use the formula \( D_n = 4n^2 - 3n \).
- Substitute the given \( n \) into this formula to compute the decagonal number.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function is_num_decagonal(n):
    calculate decagonal_number using the formula 4 * n^2 - 3 * n
    return decagonal_number
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def is_num_decagonal(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth decagonal number using the formula
    # D_n = 4n^2 - 3n
    decagonal_number = 4 * n * n - 3 * n
    return decagonal_number
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth decagonal number by applying the formula \( D_n = 4n^2 - 3n \).

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:

    1. **Formula Derivation**:
       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.

    2. **Handling the First Term**:
       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.

    3. **Efficiency**:
       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.

    4. **Code Simplicity**:
       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.

    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.
