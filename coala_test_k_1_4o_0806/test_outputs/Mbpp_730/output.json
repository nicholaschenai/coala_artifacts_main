    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and removes consecutive duplicate elements, leaving only the first occurrence of each sequence of duplicates.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and keep track of the last unique element we added to the result list. For each element in the input list:\n   - If it is different from the last element added to the result list, we add it to the result list.\n   - If it is the same as the last element added, we skip it.\n   - This way, we ensure that only the first occurrence of each sequence of duplicates is retained.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function consecutive_duplicates(lst):\n       if lst is empty:\n           return an empty list\n       \n       Initialize result list with the first element of lst\n       \n       for each element in lst starting from the second element:\n           if element is not equal to the last element in result:\n               append element to result\n       \n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef consecutive_duplicates(lst):\n    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list\n    if not lst:\n        return []\n    \n    # Initialize the result list with the first element of the input list\n    result = [lst[0]]\n    \n    # Iterate over the input list starting from the second element\n    for i in range(1, len(lst)):\n        # If the current element is different from the last element in the result list\n        if lst[i] != result[-1]:\n            # Append the current element to the result list\n            result.append(lst[i])\n    \n    # Return the result list which contains no consecutive duplicates\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently removes consecutive duplicates by iterating through the list once, making it an O(n) solution where n is the length of the list.",
