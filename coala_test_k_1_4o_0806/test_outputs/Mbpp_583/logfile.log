INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/583 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the nth Catalan number. The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics. The nth Catalan number can be calculated using the formula:

\[ C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!} \]

where \( n! \) denotes the factorial of n.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Formula**: The nth Catalan number is given by the formula \[ C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!} \]. This formula involves factorials, which are the product of all positive integers up to a given number.

2. **Calculate Factorials**: To compute the nth Catalan number, we need to calculate the factorials of \( 2n \), \( n+1 \), and \( n \).

3. **Compute the Catalan Number**: Use the formula to compute the Catalan number by dividing the factorial of \( 2n \) by the product of the factorials of \( n+1 \) and \( n \).

4. **Return the Result**: Return the computed Catalan number.

### Pseudocode

```
function factorial(n):
    if n is 0 or 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

function catalan_number(n):
    factorial_2n = factorial(2 * n)
    factorial_n1 = factorial(n + 1)
    factorial_n = factorial(n)
    catalan_n = factorial_2n // (factorial_n1 * factorial_n)
    return catalan_n
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
# Helper function to calculate factorial of a number
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Main function to calculate the nth Catalan number
def catalan_number(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate factorial of 2n
    factorial_2n = factorial(2 * n)
    # Calculate factorial of n+1
    factorial_n1 = factorial(n + 1)
    # Calculate factorial of n
    factorial_n = factorial(n)
    # Calculate the nth Catalan number using the formula
    catalan_n = factorial_2n // (factorial_n1 * factorial_n)
    # Return the result
    return catalan_n
```

This solution uses a recursive approach to calculate factorials and then applies the formula for the Catalan number. The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that the result is an integer, as expected for Catalan numbers.

    Part: 1/1
    # Catalan Numbers
    Catalan numbers is a number sequence, which is found useful in a number of combinatorial problems, often involving recursively-defined objects.

    This sequence was named after the Belgian mathematician [Catalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Charles_Catalan), who lived in the 19th century. (In fact it was known before to Euler, who lived a century before Catalan).

    The first few Catalan numbers $C_n$ (starting from zero):

     $1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, \ldots$

    ### Application in some combinatorial problems

    The Catalan number $C_n$ is the solution for

    - Number of correct bracket sequence consisting of $n$ opening and $n$ closing brackets.
    - The number of rooted full binary trees with $n + 1$ leaves (vertices are not numbered). A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children.
    - The number of ways to completely parenthesize $n + 1$ factors.
    - The number of triangulations of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides (i.e. the number of partitions of polygon into disjoint triangles by using the diagonals).
    - The number of ways to connect the $2n$ points on a circle to form $n$ disjoint chords.
    - The number of [non-isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) full binary trees with $n$ internal nodes (i.e. nodes having at least one son).
    - The number of monotonic lattice paths from point $(0, 0)$ to point $(n, n)$ in a square lattice of size $n \times n$, which do not pass above the main diagonal (i.e. connecting $(0, 0)$ to $(n, n)$).
    - Number of permutations of length $n$ that can be [stack sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-sortable_permutation) (i.e. it can be shown that the rearrangement is stack sorted if and only if there is no such index $i < j < k$, such that $a_k < a_i < a_j$ ).
    - The number of [non-crossing partitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncrossing_partition) of a set of $n$ elements.
    - The number of ways to cover the ladder $1 \ldots n$ using $n$ rectangles (The ladder consists of $n$ columns, where $i^{th}$ column has a height $i$).


    ## Calculations

    There are two formulas for the Catalan numbers: **Recursive and Analytical**. Since, we believe that all the mentioned above problems are equivalent (have the same solution), for the proof of the formulas below we will choose the task which it is easiest to do.

    ### Recursive formula
 
    $$C_0 = C_1 = 1$$

    $$C_n = \sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k} , {n} \geq 2$$

    The recurrence formula can be easily deduced from the problem of the correct bracket sequence.

    The leftmost opening parenthesis $l$ corresponds to certain closing bracket $r$, which divides the sequence into 2 parts which in turn should be a correct sequence of brackets. Thus formula is also divided into 2 parts. If we denote $k = {r - l - 1}$, then for fixed $r$, there will be exactly $C_k C_{n-1-k}$ such bracket sequences. Summing this over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.

    You can also think it in this manner. By definition, $C_n$ denotes number of correct bracket sequences. Now, the sequence may be divided into 2 parts of length $k$ and ${n - k}$, each of which should be a correct bracket sequence. Example :

    $( ) ( ( ) )$ can be divided into $( )$ and $( ( ) )$, but cannot be divided into $( ) ($ and $( ) )$. Again summing over all admissible $k's$, we get the recurrence relation on $C_n$.

    #### C++ implementation 

    ```cpp
    const int MOD = ....
    const int MAX = ....
    int catalan[MAX];
    void init() {
        catalan[0] = catalan[1] = 1;
        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {
            catalan[i] = 0;
            for (int j=0; j < i; j++) {
                catalan[i] += (catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]) % MOD;
                if (catalan[i] >= MOD) {
                    catalan[i] -= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Analytical formula

    $$C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1} {\binom{2n}{n}}$$

    (here $\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the usual binomial coefficient, i.e. number of ways to select $k$ objects from set of $n$ objects).

    The above formula can be easily concluded from the problem of the monotonic paths in square grid. The total number of  monotonic paths in the lattice size of $n \times n$ is given by $\binom{2n}{n}$.

    Now we count the number of monotonic paths which cross the main diagonal. Consider such paths crossing the main diagonal and find the first edge in it which is above the diagonal. Reflect the path about the diagonal all the way, going after this edge. The result is always a monotonic path in the grid $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$. On the other hand, any monotonic path in the lattice $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$ must intersect the diagonal. Hence, we enumerated all monotonic paths crossing the main diagonal in the lattice $n \times n$.

    The number of monotonic paths in the lattice $(n - 1) \times (n + 1)$ are $\binom{2n}{n-1}$ . Let us call such paths as "bad" paths. As a result, to obtain the number of monotonic paths which do not cross the main diagonal, we subtract the above "bad" paths, obtaining the formula:

    $$C_n = \binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n + 1} \binom{2n}{n} , {n} \geq 0$$

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/583 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the nth Catalan number. The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics. The task is to implement a function that returns the 10th Catalan number, which should be 16796.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Catalan numbers can be calculated using a recursive formula:
   - \( C_0 = 1 \)
   - \( C_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k \cdot C_{n-1-k} \) for \( n \geq 1 \)

   We can use this recursive formula to compute the nth Catalan number. However, to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times, we can use dynamic programming to store previously computed Catalan numbers in a list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function catalan_number(n):
       Create a list `catalan` of size n+1 initialized with zeros
       Set catalan[0] = 1
       For i from 1 to n:
           Set catalan[i] = 0
           For j from 0 to i-1:
               catalan[i] += catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]
       Return catalan[n]
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def catalan_number(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize a list to store Catalan numbers up to the nth number
    catalan = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # The first Catalan number is 1
    catalan[0] = 1
    
    # Calculate the Catalan numbers from 1 to n using the recursive formula

            catalan[i] += catalan[j] * catalan[i - j - 1]
    
    # Return the nth Catalan number
    return catalan[n]

This code uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the nth Catalan number by storing intermediate results in a list, thus avoiding redundant calculations.
