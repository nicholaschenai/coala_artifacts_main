    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth Catalan number. The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that have many applications in combinatorial mathematics. The task is to implement a function that returns the 10th Catalan number, which should be 16796.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The Catalan numbers can be calculated using a recursive formula:\n   - \\( C_0 = 1 \\)\n   - \\( C_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k \\cdot C_{n-1-k} \\) for \\( n \\geq 1 \\)\n\n   We can use this recursive formula to compute the nth Catalan number. However, to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times, we can use dynamic programming to store previously computed Catalan numbers in a list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function catalan_number(n):\n       Create a list `catalan` of size n+1 initialized with zeros\n       Set catalan[0] = 1\n       For i from 1 to n:\n           Set catalan[i] = 0\n           For j from 0 to i-1:\n               catalan[i] += catalan[j] * catalan[i-j-1]\n       Return catalan[n]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef catalan_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize a list to store Catalan numbers up to the nth number\n    catalan = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # The first Catalan number is 1\n    catalan[0] = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the Catalan numbers from 1 to n using the recursive formula\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        catalan[i] = 0\n        for j in range(i):\n            # Use the recursive relation to calculate the ith Catalan number\n            catalan[i] += catalan[j] * catalan[i - j - 1]\n    \n    # Return the nth Catalan number\n    return catalan[n]\n```\n\nThis code uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the nth Catalan number by storing intermediate results in a list, thus avoiding redundant calculations.",
