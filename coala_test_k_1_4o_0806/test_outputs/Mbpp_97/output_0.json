    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input, flattens it into a single list, and then counts how many times each element appears in this flattened list. The result should be returned as a dictionary where the keys are the elements and the values are their respective counts.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to flatten the list of lists into a single list. This can be done by iterating over each sublist and then over each element within those sublists, adding each element to a new list.\n   - Once we have a flattened list, we can create an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element.\n   - We then iterate over the flattened list, and for each element, we check if it is already a key in the dictionary. If it is, we increment its value by 1. If it is not, we add it to the dictionary with a value of 1.\n   - Finally, we return the dictionary containing the frequencies of each element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function frequency_lists(list_of_lists):\n       initialize an empty list called flattened_list\n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           for each element in sublist:\n               append element to flattened_list\n       \n       initialize an empty dictionary called frequency_dict\n       for each element in flattened_list:\n           if element is in frequency_dict:\n               increment the value of element in frequency_dict by 1\n           else:\n               add element to frequency_dict with a value of 1\n       \n       return frequency_dict\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef frequency_lists(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store all elements from the sublists\n    flattened_list = []\n    \n    # Flatten the list of lists into a single list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        for element in sublist:\n            flattened_list.append(element)\n    \n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each element in the flattened list\n    for element in flattened_list:\n        if element in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[element] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[element] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing the frequencies\n    return frequency_dict\n```",
