INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/424 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each string in the input tuple.
   - For each string, we will extract the last character.
   - We will collect these last characters into a list.
   - Finally, we will return this list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `extract_rear` that takes a tuple of strings as input.
   - Initialize an empty list `rear_characters`.
   - For each string in the tuple:
     - Get the last character of the string.
     - Append this character to `rear_characters`.
   - Return the `rear_characters` list.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def extract_rear(strings: tuple) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the last characters
    rear_characters = []
    
    # Iterate over each string in the input tuple
    for string in strings:
        # Append the last character of the current string to the list
        rear_characters.append(string[-1])
    
    # Return the list of last characters
    return rear_characters
```

This solution iterates over each string in the tuple, extracts the last character, and appends it to a list, which is then returned. This approach ensures that we correctly gather the last character from each string in the input tuple.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

        -----Constraints:-----
        $T \leq 2 $
        $1 \leq String length \leq 1000 $

        -----Sample Input:-----
        2
        aabcc
        bababccc

        -----Sample Output:-----
        ac
        bc

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        For 1) after removing "abc" at middle we get a new string as ac.
        For 2) string = bababccc
        newString1 = babcc  // After removing middle "abc"
        newString2 = bc   //After removing "abc"

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We have a string consisting of lowercase English letters. We need to repeatedly remove any occurrence of the substring "abc" from the string until no such substring exists. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through each character of the string and use a stack to build the resulting string. Whenever we encounter the sequence "abc" in the stack, we will remove it. This process will be repeated until we have processed all characters in the string. The stack will help us efficiently manage the removal of "abc" sequences.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           For each test case:
               Initialize an empty stack
               For each character in the string:
                   Push the character onto the stack
                   If the top three characters in the stack form "abc":
                       Pop the top three characters from the stack
               Convert the stack to a string and output it
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for string in test_cases:
                stack = []
                for char in string:
                    stack.append(char)
                    # Check if the last three characters in the stack form "abc"
                    if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:
                        # Remove the "abc" from the stack
                        stack.pop()
                        stack.pop()
                        stack.pop()
                # Convert the stack back to a string
                results.append(''.join(stack))
            return results

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        # First line is the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = data[1:T+1]

        # Get the results
        results = remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases)

        # Print the results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        This solution uses a stack to efficiently manage the removal of "abc" sequences from the string. By checking the top three elements of the stack, we can determine when to remove the sequence and continue processing the rest of the string.
