    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all odd natural numbers within a given range, inclusive of the endpoints. The function will take two integers, `l` and `r`, which define the range, and it should return the sum of all odd numbers between these two values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Iterate through each number in the range from `l` to `r`.\n   - Check if a number is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). A number is odd if `number % 2` is not equal to zero.\n   - If the number is odd, add it to a running total sum.\n   - After iterating through the range, return the total sum of all odd numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0\n   For each number `n` from `l` to `r` (inclusive):\n       If `n` is odd (i.e., `n % 2 != 0`):\n           Add `n` to `total_sum`\n   Return `total_sum`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(l: int, r: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of odd numbers to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the range from l to r (inclusive)\n    for n in range(l, r + 1):\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if n % 2 != 0:\n            # Add the odd number to the total sum\n            total_sum += n\n    \n    # Return the total sum of odd numbers\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the sum of all odd numbers within the specified range `[l, r]`.",
