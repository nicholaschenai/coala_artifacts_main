The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:\n    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.\n    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.\n    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.\n    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n            subarray_sums = []\n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n            subarray_sums.sort()\n            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])\n            return result % (10**9 + 7)\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The function will take two integers, `l` and `r`, which define the range, and it should return the sum of all odd numbers between these two values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Iterate through each number in the range from `l` to `r`.\n   - Check if a number is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). A number is odd if `number % 2` is not equal to zero.\n   - If the number is odd, add it to a running total sum.\n   - After iterating through the range, return the total sum of all odd numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0\n   For each number `n` from `l` to `r` (inclusive):\n       If `n` is odd (i.e., `n % 2 != 0`):\n           Add `n` to `total_sum`\n   Return `total_sum`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_in_range(l: int, r: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of odd numbers to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the range from l to r (inclusive)\n    for n in range(l, r + 1):\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if n % 2 != 0:\n            # Add the odd number to the total sum\n            total_sum += n\n    \n    # Return the total sum of odd numbers\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the sum of all odd numbers within the specified range `[l, r]`."
