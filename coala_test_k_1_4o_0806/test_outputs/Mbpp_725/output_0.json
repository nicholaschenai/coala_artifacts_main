    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and extracts all the substrings that are enclosed in double quotation marks. The function should return a list of these substrings.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and look for double quotation marks. When we find an opening quotation mark, we start recording characters until we find the closing quotation mark. Each time we find a complete pair of quotation marks, we add the enclosed substring to a list. We continue this process until we have processed the entire string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function extract_quotation(s):\n       Initialize an empty list called results to store the extracted substrings\n       Initialize a variable called inside_quotes to False\n       Initialize an empty string called current_string to build the substrings\n\n       for each character in s:\n           if character is a double quote:\n               if inside_quotes is True:\n                   Add current_string to results\n                   Reset current_string to empty\n                   Set inside_quotes to False\n               else:\n                   Set inside_quotes to True\n           else if inside_quotes is True:\n               Append character to current_string\n\n       return results\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_quotation(s: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted substrings\n    results = []\n    # This flag indicates whether we are currently inside a pair of quotes\n    inside_quotes = False\n    # This will hold the current substring being built\n    current_string = \"\"\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '\"':\n            # If we encounter a double quote\n            if inside_quotes:\n                # If we are already inside quotes, this means we found the closing quote\n                results.append(current_string)\n                # Reset the current string for the next potential quoted substring\n                current_string = \"\"\n                # Toggle the inside_quotes flag\n                inside_quotes = False\n            else:\n                # If we are not inside quotes, this is an opening quote\n                inside_quotes = True\n        elif inside_quotes:\n            # If we are inside quotes, add the character to the current substring\n            current_string += char\n\n    # Return the list of extracted substrings\n    return results\n```\n",
