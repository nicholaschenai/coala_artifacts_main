INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/160 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to find two integers, \( x \) and \( y \), such that the equation \( ax + by = n \) holds true for given integers \( a \), \( b \), and \( n \). If such integers exist, we should return them as a tuple \((x, y)\). If no such integers exist, we should return `None`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \( ax + by = n \) is a linear Diophantine equation. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( a \) and \( b \) divides \( n \).

2. **Finding a Solution**: If a solution exists, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one particular solution \((x_0, y_0)\) to the equation \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \). We can then scale this solution by \( \frac{n}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \) to get a solution to \( ax + by = n \).

3. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Compute the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \).
   - Check if \( n \) is divisible by this GCD. If not, return `None`.
   - Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one solution to \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \).
   - Scale this solution to find a solution to \( ax + by = n \).

### Pseudocode

```
function extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (a, 1, 0)
    else:
        gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
        x = y1
        y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
        return (gcd, x, y)

function find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None
    scale = n // gcd
    x = x0 * scale
    y = y0 * scale
    return (x, y)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    # Base case: if b is 0, gcd is a, and coefficients are (1, 0)
    if b == 0:
        return (a, 1, 0)
    else:
        # Recursive call
        gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
        # Update x and y using results of recursion
        x = y1
        y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
        return (gcd, x, y)

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    # Get gcd and coefficients for the equation ax + by = gcd(a, b)
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    # Check if n is divisible by gcd
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None
    # Scale the solution to match the equation ax + by = n
    scale = n // gcd
    x = x0 * scale
    y = y0 * scale
    return (x, y)
```

This code uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a solution to the linear Diophantine equation, ensuring that the solution is only returned if it exists.

    Title: Linear Congruence Equation
    Part: 1/1
    # Linear Congruence Equation

    This equation is of the form:

    $$a \cdot x \equiv b \pmod n,$$

    where $a$, $b$ and $n$ are given integers and $x$ is an unknown integer.

    It is required to find the value $x$ from the interval $[0, n-1]$ (clearly, on the entire number line there can be infinitely many solutions that will differ from each other in $n \cdot k$ , where $k$ is any integer). If the solution is not unique, then we will consider how to get all the solutions.

    ## Solution by finding the inverse element

    Let us first consider a simpler case where $a$ and $n$ are **coprime** ($\gcd(a, n) = 1$).
    Then one can find the [inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$, and multiplying both sides of the equation with the inverse, and we can get a **unique** solution.

    $$x \equiv b \cdot a ^ {- 1} \pmod n$$

    Now consider the case where $a$ and $n$ are **not coprime** ($\gcd(a, n) \ne 1$).
    Then the solution will not always exist (for example $2 \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ has no solution).

    Let $g = \gcd(a, n)$, i.e. the [greatest common divisor](euclid-algorithm.md) of $a$ and $n$ (which in this case is greater than one).

    Then, if $b$ is not divisible by $g$, there is no solution. In fact, for any $x$ the left side of the equation $a \cdot x \pmod n$ , is always divisible by $g$, while the right-hand side is not divisible by it, hence it follows that there are no solutions.

    If $g$ divides $b$, then by dividing both sides of the equation by $g$ (i.e. dividing $a$, $b$ and $n$ by $g$), we receive a new equation:

    $$a^\prime \cdot x \equiv b^\prime \pmod{n^\prime}$$

    in which $a^\prime$ and $n^\prime$ are already relatively prime, and we have already learned how to handle such an equation.
    We get $x^\prime$ as solution for $x$.

    It is clear that this $x^\prime$ will also be a solution of the original equation.
    However it will **not be the only solution**.
    It can be shown that the original equation has exactly $g$ solutions, and they will look like this:

    $$x_i \equiv (x^\prime + i\cdot n^\prime) \pmod n \quad \text{for } i = 0 \ldots g-1$$

    Summarizing, we can say that the **number of solutions** of the linear congruence equation is equal to either $g = \gcd(a, n)$ or to zero.

    ## Solution with the Extended Euclidean Algorithm

    We can rewrite the linear congruence to the following Diophantine equation:

    $$a \cdot x + n \cdot k = b,$$

    where $x$ and $k$ are unknown integers.

    The method of solving this equation is described in the corresponding article [Linear Diophantine equations](linear-diophantine-equation.md) and it consists of applying the [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md).

    It also describes the method of obtaining all solutions of this equation from one found solution, and incidentally this method, when carefully considered, is absolutely equivalent to the method described in the previous section.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/160 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find two integers, `x` and `y`, such that when multiplied by given integers `a` and `b` respectively, their sum equals another given integer `n`. If such integers `x` and `y` exist, we return them as a tuple `(x, y)`. If no such integers exist, we return `None`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   This problem is a classic example of a linear Diophantine equation of the form `ax + by = n`. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` divides `n`. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one particular solution `(x0, y0)` to the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. If `gcd(a, b)` divides `n`, we can scale this solution by `n / gcd(a, b)` to get a solution to the original equation.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function extended_gcd(a, b):
       if b == 0:
           return (a, 1, 0)

       scale = n // gcd
       x = x0 * scale
       y = y0 * scale
       return (x, y)
   ```

    # Base case: if b is 0, gcd is a, and coefficients are (1, 0)
    if b == 0:

The code doesn't pass all the tests.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.
- Then, think step-by-step about where you went wrong in your latest solution.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/160 [generation text] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = n`.
   - The test case `find_solution(2, 3, 7)` should return `(2, 1)` because `2*2 + 3*1 = 7`.

2. **Reviewing the Solution:**
   - The solution uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one particular solution `(x0, y0)` to the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
   - If `gcd(a, b)` divides `n`, we scale this solution by `n / gcd(a, b)` to get a solution to the original equation.

3. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The Extended Euclidean Algorithm provides one particular solution, but it might not be the one expected by the test case.
   - The solution returned by the algorithm is valid, but it might not match the specific solution `(2, 1)` expected by the test case.
   - The algorithm returns `(-7, 7)` which is a valid solution because `2*(-7) + 3*7 = 7`.

4. **Where the Solution Went Wrong:**
   - The solution is mathematically correct, but it doesn't account for finding a specific solution that matches the test case.
   - The problem is not with the algorithm itself but with the expectation of a specific solution form.

5. **Adjusting the Solution:**
   - We need to adjust the solution to find a positive `x` and `y` that matches the test case.
   - We can adjust the solution by finding a particular solution and then iterating to find a positive solution.

Let's adjust the solution to find a positive solution that matches the test case:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (a, 1, 0)
    else:
        gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
        x = y1
        y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
        return (gcd, x, y)

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None
    scale = n // gcd
    x = x0 * scale
    y = y0 * scale
    
    # Adjust x and y to be positive
    # We can adjust x and y by adding/subtracting multiples of (b/gcd, a/gcd)
    b_div_gcd = b // gcd
    a_div_gcd = a // gcd
    
    # Adjust x to be positive
    while x < 0:
        x += b_div_gcd
        y -= a_div_gcd
    
    # Adjust y to be positive
    while y < 0:
        x -= b_div_gcd
        y += a_div_gcd
    
    return (x, y)
```

This solution adjusts the initial solution to ensure that both `x` and `y` are positive, which should match the expected test case output.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/160 [prompt] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find two integers, `x` and `y`, such that when multiplied by given integers `a` and `b` respectively, their sum equals another given integer `n`. If such integers `x` and `y` exist, we return them as a tuple `(x, y)`. If no such integers exist, we return `None`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   This problem is a classic example of a linear Diophantine equation of the form `ax + by = n`. A solution exists if and only if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` divides `n`. We can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find one particular solution `(x0, y0)` to the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. If `gcd(a, b)` divides `n`, we can scale this solution by `n / gcd(a, b)` to get a solution to the original equation.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function extended_gcd(a, b):
       if b == 0:
           return (a, 1, 0)
       else:
           gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
           x = y1
           y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
           return (gcd, x, y)

   function find_solution(a, b, n):
       gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
       if n % gcd != 0:
           return None
       scale = n // gcd
       x = x0 * scale
       y = y0 * scale
       return (x, y)
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    # Base case: if b is 0, gcd is a, and coefficients are (1, 0)
    if b == 0:
        return (a, 1, 0)
    else:
        # Recursively apply the extended Euclidean algorithm
        gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
        # Update x and y using results from recursion
        x = y1
        y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
        return (gcd, x, y)

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    # Use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find gcd and coefficients
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    # Check if n is divisible by gcd, if not, no solution exists
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None
    # Scale the solution to match the original equation
    scale = n // gcd
    x = x0 * scale
    y = y0 * scale
    return (x, y)
```

This code uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find a solution to the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = n`, if it exists. If `n` is not divisible by the GCD of `a` and `b`, it returns `None`, indicating no solution exists. Otherwise, it scales the solution to satisfy the equation.

## Instructions
- First, think step-by-step about why your code is wrong.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/160 [prompt] Let's analyze the problem and the solution step-by-step to identify where the issue might be.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = n`.
   - The test case `find_solution(2, 3, 7)` should return `(2, 1)` because `2*2 + 3*1 = 7`.

   - The solution returned by the algorithm is valid, but it might not match the specific solution `(2, 1)` expected by the test case.
   - The algorithm returns `(-7, 7)` which is a valid solution because `2*(-7) + 3*7 = 7`.

   - The solution is mathematically correct, but it doesn't account for finding a specific solution that matches the test case.
   - The problem is not with the algorithm itself but with the expectation of a specific solution form.

5. **Adjusting the Solution:**
   - We need to adjust the solution to find a positive `x` and `y` that matches the test case.
   - We can adjust the solution by finding a particular solution and then iterating to find a positive solution.

Let's adjust the solution to find a positive solution that matches the test case:

```python
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (a, 1, 0)
    else:
        gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b, a % b)
        x = y1
        y = x1 - (a // b) * y1
        return (gcd, x, y)

def find_solution(a, b, n):
    gcd, x0, y0 = extended_gcd(a, b)
    if n % gcd != 0:
        return None
    scale = n // gcd
    x = x0 * scale
    y = y0 * scale
    
    # Adjust x and y to be positive
    # We can adjust x and y by adding/subtracting multiples of (b/gcd, a/gcd)
    b_div_gcd = b // gcd
    a_div_gcd = a // gcd
    
    # Adjust x to be positive
    while x < 0:
        x += b_div_gcd
        y -= a_div_gcd
    
    # Adjust y to be positive
    while y < 0:
        x -= b_div_gcd
        y += a_div_gcd
    
    return (x, y)
```

This solution adjusts the initial solution to ensure that both `x` and `y` are positive, which should match the expected test case output.

    Title: Linear Congruence Equation
    Part: 1/1
    # Linear Congruence Equation

    This equation is of the form:

    $$a \cdot x \equiv b \pmod n,$$

    where $a$, $b$ and $n$ are given integers and $x$ is an unknown integer.

    It is required to find the value $x$ from the interval $[0, n-1]$ (clearly, on the entire number line there can be infinitely many solutions that will differ from each other in $n \cdot k$ , where $k$ is any integer). If the solution is not unique, then we will consider how to get all the solutions.

    ## Solution by finding the inverse element

    Let us first consider a simpler case where $a$ and $n$ are **coprime** ($\gcd(a, n) = 1$).
    Then one can find the [inverse](module-inverse.md) of $a$, and multiplying both sides of the equation with the inverse, and we can get a **unique** solution.

    $$x \equiv b \cdot a ^ {- 1} \pmod n$$

    Now consider the case where $a$ and $n$ are **not coprime** ($\gcd(a, n) \ne 1$).
    Then the solution will not always exist (for example $2 \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ has no solution).

    Let $g = \gcd(a, n)$, i.e. the [greatest common divisor](euclid-algorithm.md) of $a$ and $n$ (which in this case is greater than one).

    Then, if $b$ is not divisible by $g$, there is no solution. In fact, for any $x$ the left side of the equation $a \cdot x \pmod n$ , is always divisible by $g$, while the right-hand side is not divisible by it, hence it follows that there are no solutions.

    If $g$ divides $b$, then by dividing both sides of the equation by $g$ (i.e. dividing $a$, $b$ and $n$ by $g$), we receive a new equation:

    $$a^\prime \cdot x \equiv b^\prime \pmod{n^\prime}$$

    in which $a^\prime$ and $n^\prime$ are already relatively prime, and we have already learned how to handle such an equation.
    We get $x^\prime$ as solution for $x$.

    It is clear that this $x^\prime$ will also be a solution of the original equation.
    However it will **not be the only solution**.
    It can be shown that the original equation has exactly $g$ solutions, and they will look like this:

    $$x_i \equiv (x^\prime + i\cdot n^\prime) \pmod n \quad \text{for } i = 0 \ldots g-1$$

    Summarizing, we can say that the **number of solutions** of the linear congruence equation is equal to either $g = \gcd(a, n)$ or to zero.

    ## Solution with the Extended Euclidean Algorithm

    We can rewrite the linear congruence to the following Diophantine equation:

    $$a \cdot x + n \cdot k = b,$$

    where $x$ and $k$ are unknown integers.

    The method of solving this equation is described in the corresponding article [Linear Diophantine equations](linear-diophantine-equation.md) and it consists of applying the [Extended Euclidean Algorithm](extended-euclid-algorithm.md).

    It also describes the method of obtaining all solutions of this equation from one found solution, and incidentally this method, when carefully considered, is absolutely equivalent to the method described in the previous section.
