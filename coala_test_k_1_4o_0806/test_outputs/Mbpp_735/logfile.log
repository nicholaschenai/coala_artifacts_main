INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/735 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and toggles all the bits of its binary representation except for the first and last bits. Toggling a bit means changing a 0 to a 1 and a 1 to a 0.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Convert the integer to its binary representation.
2. Identify the first and last bits, which should remain unchanged.
3. Toggle all the bits between the first and last bits.
4. Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer.
5. Return the resulting integer.

## Pseudocode

1. Convert the input number to its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix.
2. If the binary representation has less than 3 bits, return the number as is because there are no middle bits to toggle.
3. Extract the first and last bits.
4. Toggle the middle bits by iterating over them and changing each '0' to '1' and each '1' to '0'.
5. Concatenate the first bit, the toggled middle bits, and the last bit to form the new binary string.
6. Convert the new binary string back to an integer.
7. Return the integer.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def toggle_middle_bits(n: int) -> int:
    # Convert the number to a binary string without the '0b' prefix
    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # If the binary representation has less than 3 bits, return the number as is
    if len(binary_str) < 3:
        return n
    
    # Extract the first and last bits
    first_bit = binary_str[0]
    last_bit = binary_str[-1]
    
    # Toggle the middle bits
    middle_bits = binary_str[1:-1]
    toggled_middle_bits = ''.join('1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in middle_bits)
    
    # Form the new binary string
    new_binary_str = first_bit + toggled_middle_bits + last_bit
    
    # Convert the new binary string back to an integer
    result = int(new_binary_str, 2)
    
    return result
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and should correctly toggle the middle bits of the binary representation of the input number.

    [Task]:
        Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:

        Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
        Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.

        Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.
Â 
        Example 1:
        Input: n = 0
        Output: 0

        Example 2:
        Input: n = 3
        Output: 2
        Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
        "11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
        "01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.

        Example 3:
        Input: n = 6
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
        "110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
        "010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.
        "011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
        "001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.

        Example 4:
        Input: n = 9

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We need to transform a given integer `n` into `0` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:
           - Change the rightmost bit (0th bit) in the binary representation of `n`.
           - Change the `i-th` bit if the `(i-1)-th` bit is `1` and all bits from `0` to `(i-2)` are `0`.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           The problem can be approached by understanding the binary representation of `n`. The operations allowed are essentially flipping bits under certain conditions. The key is to determine the minimum number of such flips required to turn all bits to `0`.

           The solution involves:
           - Using a recursive approach to determine the number of operations needed to transform `n` to `0`.
           - If `n` is `0`, no operations are needed.
           - If `n` is `1`, one operation is needed to flip the 0th bit.
           - For larger numbers, recursively determine the number of operations needed for the number formed by removing the most significant bit, and adjust based on whether the most significant bit is `1` or `0`.

        3. **Pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function minimumOneBitOperations(n):
               if n is 0:
                   return 0
               if n is 1:
                   return 1
               find the most significant bit position of n
               let m be the number formed by removing the most significant bit
               if the most significant bit of n is 1:
                   return (1 << position) - 1 - minimumOneBitOperations(m)
               else:
                   return minimumOneBitOperations(m)
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
                # Helper function to calculate the minimum operations
                def helper(n):
                    if n == 0:
                        return 0
                    if n == 1:
                        return 1
            
                    # Find the most significant bit position
                    msb_pos = n.bit_length() - 1
            
                    # Calculate the number formed by removing the most significant bit
                    m = n ^ (1 << msb_pos)
            
                    # If the most significant bit is 1, use the formula
                    if n & (1 << msb_pos):
                        return (1 << msb_pos) - 1 - helper(m)
                    else:
                        return helper(m)
        
                # Call the helper function with the initial number
                return helper(n)
        ```

        This solution uses a recursive approach to determine the minimum number of operations needed to transform `n` into `0` by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and bit manipulation.
