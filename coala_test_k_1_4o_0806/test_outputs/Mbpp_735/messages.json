Toggling a bit means changing a 0 to a 1 and a 1 to a 0.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Convert the integer to its binary representation.\n2. Identify the first and last bits, which should remain unchanged.\n3. Toggle all the bits between the first and last bits.\n4. Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer.\n5. Return the resulting integer.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Convert the input number to its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix.\n2. If the binary representation has less than 3 bits, return the number as is because there are no middle bits to toggle.\n3. Extract the first and last bits.\n4. Toggle the middle bits by iterating over them and changing each '0' to '1' and each '1' to '0'.\n5. Concatenate the first bit, the toggled middle bits, and the last bit to form the new binary string.\n6. Convert the new binary string back to an integer.\n7. Return the integer.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef toggle_middle_bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # Convert the number to a binary string without the '0b' prefix\n    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]\n    \n    # If the binary representation has less than 3 bits, return the number as is\n    if len(binary_str) < 3:\n        return n\n    \n    # Extract the first and last bits\n    first_bit = binary_str[0]\n    last_bit = binary_str[-1]\n    \n    # Toggle the middle bits\n    middle_bits = binary_str[1:-1]\n    toggled_middle_bits = ''.join('1' if bit == '0' else '0' for bit in middle_bits)\n    \n    # Form the new binary string\n    new_binary_str = first_bit + toggled_middle_bits + last_bit\n    \n    # Convert the new binary string back to an integer\n    result = int(new_binary_str, 2)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and should correctly toggle the middle bits of the binary representation of the input number."

The operations allowed are:\n           - Change the rightmost bit (0th bit) in the binary representation of `n`.\n           - Change the `i-th` bit if the `(i-1)-th` bit is `1` and all bits from `0` to `(i-2)` are `0`.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           The problem can be approached by understanding the binary representation of `n`. The operations allowed are essentially flipping bits under certain conditions. The key is to determine the minimum number of such flips required to turn all bits to `0`.\n\n           The solution involves:\n           - Using a recursive approach to determine the number of operations needed to transform `n` to `0`.\n           - If `n` is `0`, no operations are needed.\n           - If `n` is `1`, one operation is needed to flip the 0th bit.\n           - For larger numbers, recursively determine the number of operations needed for the number formed by removing the most significant bit, and adjust based on whether the most significant bit is `1` or `0`.\n\n        3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function minimumOneBitOperations(n):\n               if n is 0:\n                   return 0\n               if n is 1:\n                   return 1\n               find the most significant bit position of n\n               let m be the number formed by removing the most significant bit\n               if the most significant bit of n is 1:\n                   return (1 << position) - 1 - minimumOneBitOperations(m)\n               else:\n                   return minimumOneBitOperations(m)\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n                # Helper function to calculate the minimum operations\n                def helper(n):\n                    if n == 0:\n                        return 0\n                    if n == 1:\n                        return 1\n            \n                    # Find the most significant bit position\n                    msb_pos = n.bit_length() - 1\n            \n                    # Calculate the number formed by removing the most significant bit\n                    m = n ^ (1 << msb_pos)\n            \n                    # If the most significant bit is 1, use the formula\n                    if n & (1 << msb_pos):\n                        return (1 << msb_pos) - 1 - helper(m)\n                    else:\n                        return helper(m)\n        \n                # Call the helper function with the initial number\n                return helper(n)\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses a recursive approach to determine the minimum number of operations needed to transform `n` into `0` by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and bit manipulation.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [0] Output: 0\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
