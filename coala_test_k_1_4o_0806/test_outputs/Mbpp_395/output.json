    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the first character in a given string that does not repeat. If all characters repeat, we should return `None`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a two-pass approach:\n   - First, iterate through the string and count the occurrences of each character using a dictionary.\n   - Then, iterate through the string again to find the first character with a count of 1 in the dictionary. This character is the first non-repeated character.\n   - If no such character is found, return `None`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function first_non_repeating_character(s):\n       Initialize an empty dictionary to store character counts\n       \n       for each character in s:\n           Increment the count of the character in the dictionary\n       \n       for each character in s:\n           if the count of the character in the dictionary is 1:\n               return the character\n       \n       return None\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef first_non_repeating_character(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize a dictionary to store the count of each character\n    char_count = {}\n    \n    # First pass: count the occurrences of each character\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n    \n    # Second pass: find the first character with a count of 1\n    for char in s:\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\n            return char\n    \n    # If no non-repeating character is found, return None\n    return None\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the first non-repeated character by using a dictionary to count occurrences and then checking for the first character with a count of 1.",
