We need to create a function that takes three dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any duplicate keys among the dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary with that key should be used in the merged dictionary.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will take three dictionaries as input.
2. We will create a new dictionary to store the merged result.
3. We will update this new dictionary with the key-value pairs from each of the three input dictionaries in sequence.
4. If a key appears in more than one dictionary, the value from the last dictionary containing that key will be used.
5. Finally, we will return the merged dictionary.

## Pseudocode

```
function merge_dictionaries_three(dict1, dict2, dict3):
    create an empty dictionary called merged_dict
    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict1
    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict2
    update merged_dict with the key-value pairs from dict3
    return merged_dict
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1: dict, dict2: dict, dict3: dict) -> dict:
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the merged result
    merged_dict = {}
    
    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the first dictionary
    merged_dict.update(dict1)
    
    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the second dictionary
    merged_dict.update(dict2)
    
    # Update the merged dictionary with key-value pairs from the third dictionary
    merged_dict.update(dict3)
    
    # Return the merged dictionary
    return merged_dict

Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights:

    1. **Data Structures**: The official solution uses a dictionary to map scores to the number of contestants, which is a neat way to handle the association between scores and contestants. This approach is similar to my use of `zip` to pair scores and contestants, but the dictionary provides direct access to the number of contestants for a given score.

    2. **Sorting and Counting**: Both solutions involve sorting the scores and counting the number of decreases in the number of contestants. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to compare consecutive elements, which is a clean and efficient way to count decreases.

    3. **Handling Ties**: The official solution uses a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score and then sorts these groups. This is an effective way to handle ties, ensuring that problems with the same difficulty are sorted by their indices.

    4. **Output**: The official solution constructs a final list of problem indices by iterating over sorted difficulty scores and their associated problem indices. This approach is clear and ensures the correct order of output.

    Overall, both solutions are similar in logic and efficiency. The official solution's use of dictionaries for grouping and sorting is a useful technique for handling ties and organizing data, which can be applied to similar problems in the future.
