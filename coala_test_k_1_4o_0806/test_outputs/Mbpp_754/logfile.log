INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/754 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find elements that are common across three lists, but with a specific condition: the elements must appear at the same index in all three lists. The function should return a list of these common elements.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through the indices of the lists.
2. For each index, we will check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same.
3. If they are the same, we will add that element to our result list.
4. Finally, we will return the result list containing all such common elements.

## Pseudocode

```
function extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    initialize an empty list called common_elements
    determine the minimum length of the three lists
    for each index i from 0 to the minimum length - 1:
        if the elements at index i in l1, l2, and l3 are the same:
            add the element to common_elements
    return common_elements
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):
    # Initialize an empty list to store common elements
    common_elements = []
    
    # Determine the minimum length of the three lists
    min_length = min(len(l1), len(l2), len(l3))
    
    # Iterate over the indices up to the minimum length
    for i in range(min_length):
        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists
        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:
            # If they are the same, add the element to the common_elements list
            common_elements.append(l1[i])
    
    # Return the list of common elements
    return common_elements
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of times all three groups of students (first-year, second-year, and third-year) are present on campus simultaneously over a given number of days. The key insight was recognizing that this simultaneous presence occurs at intervals that are multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of their respective visit intervals (x, y, z).

    The solution involved calculating the LCM of three numbers, which required understanding and implementing the greatest common divisor (GCD) function. The LCM of two numbers can be calculated using the formula: `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`. For three numbers, the LCM can be found by chaining this operation: `lcm(lcm(x, y), z)`.

    The strategy was straightforward: compute the total number of hours over the given days, calculate the LCM of the visit intervals, and then determine how many times this LCM fits into the total hours. This approach efficiently solved the problem within the constraints.

    The implementation was successful on the first attempt, with no unexpected errors. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding LCM and GCD calculations, which are common in problems involving periodic events or schedules.
