The function should return a list of these common elements.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate through the indices of the lists.\n2. For each index, we will check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same.\n3. If they are the same, we will add that element to our result list.\n4. Finally, we will return the result list containing all such common elements.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n    initialize an empty list called common_elements\n    determine the minimum length of the three lists\n    for each index i from 0 to the minimum length - 1:\n        if the elements at index i in l1, l2, and l3 are the same:\n            add the element to common_elements\n    return common_elements\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef extract_index_list(l1, l2, l3):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store common elements\n    common_elements = []\n    \n    # Determine the minimum length of the three lists\n    min_length = min(len(l1), len(l2), len(l3))\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices up to the minimum length\n    for i in range(min_length):\n        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists\n        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:\n            # If they are the same, add the element to the common_elements list\n            common_elements.append(l1[i])\n    \n    # Return the list of common elements\n    return common_elements\n```"

The key insight was recognizing that this simultaneous presence occurs at intervals that are multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of their respective visit intervals (x, y, z).\n\n    The solution involved calculating the LCM of three numbers, which required understanding and implementing the greatest common divisor (GCD) function. The LCM of two numbers can be calculated using the formula: `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`. For three numbers, the LCM can be found by chaining this operation: `lcm(lcm(x, y), z)`.\n\n    The strategy was straightforward: compute the total number of hours over the given days, calculate the LCM of the visit intervals, and then determine how many times this LCM fits into the total hours. This approach efficiently solved the problem within the constraints.\n\n    The implementation was successful on the first attempt, with no unexpected errors. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding LCM and GCD calculations, which are common in problems involving periodic events or schedules.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
