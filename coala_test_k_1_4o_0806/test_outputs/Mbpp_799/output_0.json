    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a 32-bit integer and rotates its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. The function should return the resulting integer after the rotation.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To rotate the bits of a 32-bit integer to the left by `d` positions:\n   - Shift the bits of the number to the left by `d` positions.\n   - The bits that overflow beyond the 32nd position should wrap around and fill the rightmost positions.\n   - Use bitwise operations to achieve this: \n     - Perform a left shift on the number by `d` positions.\n     - Perform a right shift on the number by `(32 - d)` positions to get the bits that overflowed.\n     - Use a bitwise OR to combine these two results.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function left_rotate(n, d):\n       left_shifted = n << d\n       right_shifted = n >> (32 - d)\n       result = (left_shifted | right_shifted) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef left_rotate(n: int, d: int) -> int:\n    # Perform left shift on the number by d positions\n    left_shifted = n << d\n    \n    # Perform right shift on the number by (32 - d) positions\n    right_shifted = n >> (32 - d)\n    \n    # Combine the left shifted and right shifted results using bitwise OR\n    # Mask with 0xFFFFFFFF to ensure the result is within 32 bits\n    result = (left_shifted | right_shifted) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly rotate the bits of a 32-bit integer to the left by `d` positions, ensuring that the result is also a 32-bit integer.",
