        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a 32-bit integer and rotates its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. The function should return the resulting integer after the rotation.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Bit Rotation**: Rotating bits to the left by `d` positions means that each bit in the number is shifted `d` positions to the left. The bits that overflow on the left are wrapped around to the right end of the number.\n\n2. **32-bit Constraint**: Since the number is 32-bit, we need to ensure that the rotation respects this bit width. This means that after shifting, any bits that go beyond the 32nd position should wrap around to the beginning.\n\n3. **Steps to Rotate**:\n   - Shift the number to the left by `d` positions.\n   - Capture the bits that overflow beyond the 32nd bit.\n   - Shift these overflow bits to the right end of the number.\n   - Combine the two results using a bitwise OR operation.\n\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since rotating by 32 or more positions results in the same number, we can use `d % 32` to simplify the rotation.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Calculate `d = d % 32` to handle cases where `d` is 32 or more.\n2. Perform a left shift on the number by `d` positions.\n3. Capture the overflow bits by right shifting the number by `(32 - d)` positions.\n4. Combine the results using a bitwise OR to get the final rotated number.\n5. Return the result.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef left_rotate(n: int, d: int) -> int:\n    # Step 1: Normalize d to be within 0 to 31\n    d = d % 32\n    \n    # Step 2: Perform the left rotation\n    # Left shift the number by d positions\n    left_shifted = n << d\n    \n    # Step 3: Capture the overflow bits\n    # Right shift the number by (32 - d) positions\n    overflow_bits = n >> (32 - d)\n    \n    # Step 4: Combine the left shifted and overflow bits using bitwise OR\n    result = (left_shifted | overflow_bits) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n    \n    # Step 5: Return the result\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code will correctly rotate the bits of a 32-bit integer to the left by `d` positions, wrapping any overflow bits around to the right end. The use of `0xFFFFFFFF` ensures that the result is constrained to 32 bits."

The operations are based on flipping bits under certain conditions, which can be tricky to conceptualize initially.\n\n    2. **Recursive Approach:**\n       - My initial approach used recursion to break down the problem by focusing on the most significant bit and recursively solving for the rest. This approach is intuitive for problems involving bit manipulation, as it allows us to handle one bit at a time.\n\n    3. **Official Solution Insights:**\n       - The official solution uses an iterative approach, which is more efficient in terms of space complexity since it avoids the overhead of recursive calls.\n       - It cleverly uses bitwise operations to count the number of set bits (`s`) and then iteratively adjusts `n` by flipping bits based on the count of set bits.\n       - The use of bitwise operations like `&`, `^`, and bit shifts (`>>`, `<<`) is efficient and concise, making the solution both time and space efficient.\n\n    4. **Key Takeaways:**\n       - The iterative approach in the official solution is a good example of how bit manipulation can be used effectively to solve problems that might initially seem recursive in nature.\n       - Understanding how to manipulate bits directly and using bitwise operations can lead to more efficient solutions, especially in problems involving binary representations.\n       - The solution highlights the importance of understanding the properties of binary numbers and how operations like XOR can be used to toggle bits efficiently.\n\n    Overall, the official solution provides a more efficient and elegant way to solve the problem, demonstrating the power of bitwise operations in algorithm design.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
