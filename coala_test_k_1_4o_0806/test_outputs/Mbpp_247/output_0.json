    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the length of the longest subsequence in a given string that reads the same forwards and backwards. This is known as the longest palindromic subsequence.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We'll create a 2D table where each entry `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring from index `i` to `j`. The idea is to build this table by considering all possible substrings and using previously computed results to find the solution for larger substrings.\n\n   - If the characters at the start and end of the substring are the same, then the length of the longest palindromic subsequence is 2 plus the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of the substring without these two characters.\n   - If they are different, the length is the maximum of the longest palindromic subsequences obtained by either removing the start character or the end character.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function lps(s):\n       n = length of s\n       create a 2D array dp of size n x n initialized to 0\n\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           dp[i][i] = 1  // every single character is a palindrome of length 1\n\n       for length from 2 to n:\n           for i from 0 to n-length:\n               j = i + length - 1\n               if s[i] == s[j]:\n                   dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]\n               else:\n                   dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n\n       return dp[0][n-1]  // the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the entire string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef lps(s: str) -> int:\n    n = len(s)\n    # Create a 2D array to store the length of the longest palindromic subsequence\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n    # Every single character is a palindrome of length 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = 1\n\n    # Build the table. The outer loop is for the length of the substring\n    for length in range(2, n + 1):\n        for i in range(n - length + 1):\n            j = i + length - 1\n            if s[i] == s[j]:\n                dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i + 1][j - 1]\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n\n    # The result is in the top right corner of the table\n    return dp[0][n - 1]\n```\n\nThis code uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the given string.",
