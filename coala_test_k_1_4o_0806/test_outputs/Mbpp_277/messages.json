The dictionary contains key-value pairs where the keys are names (strings) and the values are numbers (integers). The function should return a new dictionary that only includes the entries from the original dictionary where the values are greater than or equal to `n`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the filtered results.\n2. Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary.\n3. For each pair, check if the value is greater than or equal to `n`.\n4. If the condition is met, add the key-value pair to the new dictionary.\n5. After iterating through all pairs, return the new dictionary.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction dict_filter(input_dict, n):\n    create an empty dictionary called filtered_dict\n    for each key, value in input_dict:\n        if value >= n:\n            add key, value to filtered_dict\n    return filtered_dict\n```\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef dict_filter(input_dict: dict, n: int) -> dict:\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store the filtered results\n    filtered_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each key-value pair in the input dictionary\n    for key, value in input_dict.items():\n        # Check if the value is greater than or equal to n\n        if value >= n:\n            # Add the key-value pair to the filtered dictionary\n            filtered_dict[key] = value\n    \n    # Return the filtered dictionary\n    return filtered_dict\n```"

The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\n    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.\n\n    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. \n\n    Here is the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            steps = 0\n            while n != 1:\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    n //= 2\n                else:\n                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                        n -= 1\n                    else:\n                        n += 1\n                steps += 1\n            return steps\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
