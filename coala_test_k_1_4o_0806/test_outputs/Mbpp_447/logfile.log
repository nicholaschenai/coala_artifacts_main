INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/447 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list where each element is the cube of the corresponding element in the input list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate over each element in the input list.
2. For each element, we will calculate its cube (i.e., raise it to the power of 3).
3. We will store each cubed value in a new list.
4. Finally, we will return the new list containing all the cubed values.

## Pseudocode

```
function cube_nums(nums):
    create an empty list called cubed_list
    for each number in nums:
        calculate the cube of the number
        append the cubed value to cubed_list
    return cubed_list
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def cube_nums(nums):
    # Create an empty list to store the cubed values
    cubed_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # Calculate the cube of the current number
        cubed_value = num ** 3
        
        # Append the cubed value to the cubed_list
        cubed_list.append(cubed_value)
    
    # Return the list of cubed values
    return cubed_list
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.

    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.

    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            if not nums:
                return 0
        
            n = len(nums)
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.

   ```
   Define a function cube_nums that takes a list of integers as input.
   Initialize an empty list to store the cubes.
