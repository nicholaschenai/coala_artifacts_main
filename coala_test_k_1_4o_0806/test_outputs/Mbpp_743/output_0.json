    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list and a number as inputs. The function should rotate the list to the right by the specified number of positions. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and the number is `3`, the function should return `[8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To rotate a list to the right by a given number of positions, we can use the following approach:\n   - Determine the effective number of rotations needed by taking the modulus of the number of rotations with the length of the list. This is because rotating a list by its length results in the same list.\n   - Slice the list into two parts: the last `k` elements and the rest of the list.\n   - Concatenate these two parts in reverse order to achieve the desired rotation.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function rotate_right(lst, k):\n       n = length of lst\n       k = k % n  # Effective rotations\n       if k == 0:\n           return lst  # No rotation needed\n       return lst[-k:] + lst[:-k]  # Concatenate the last k elements with the rest\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef rotate_right(lst, k):\n    # Calculate the length of the list\n    n = len(lst)\n    \n    # Calculate the effective number of rotations needed\n    k = k % n\n    \n    # If no rotation is needed, return the original list\n    if k == 0:\n        return lst\n    \n    # Return the rotated list by slicing and concatenating\n    return lst[-k:] + lst[:-k]\n```\n\nThis function will correctly rotate the list to the right by the specified number of positions.",
