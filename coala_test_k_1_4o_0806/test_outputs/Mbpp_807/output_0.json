    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the first odd number from that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the list. For each number, we will check if it is odd. A number is odd if it is not divisible evenly by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero). As soon as we find the first odd number, we will return it. If there are no odd numbers in the list, the function will return `None`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named first_odd that takes a list of numbers as input.\n   For each number in the list:\n       Check if the number is odd (number % 2 is not equal to 0).\n       If it is odd, return that number.\n   If no odd number is found, return None.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef first_odd(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            # Return the first odd number found\n            return number\n    # If no odd number is found, return None\n    return None\n```",
