INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/807 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the first odd number found in that list. If the list contains only odd numbers, the function should return the first element of the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Iterate through each number in the list.
   - Check if the current number is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`).
   - If a number is odd (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`), return that number immediately.
   - Since the problem guarantees that there is at least one odd number in the list, we don't need to handle the case where no odd number is found.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function first_odd(numbers):
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is odd:
               return number
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def first_odd(numbers):
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is odd
        if number % 2 != 0:
            # Return the first odd number found
            return number
```

This function will correctly return the first odd number from the list of numbers provided as input.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this pattern generation task, I encountered a few key insights:

    1. **Pattern Understanding**: The main challenge was correctly understanding the pattern generation logic. The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.

    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.

    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.

    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:
    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.
    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.
    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. 

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.

   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the first odd number from that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the list. For each number, we will check if it is odd. A number is odd if it is not divisible evenly by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero). As soon as we find the first odd number, we will return it. If there are no odd numbers in the list, the function will return `None`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function named first_odd that takes a list of numbers as input.
   For each number in the list:
       Check if the number is odd (number % 2 is not equal to 0).
       If it is odd, return that number.
