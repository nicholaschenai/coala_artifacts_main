    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and calculates the sum of all the negative numbers in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the list. For each number, we will check if it is negative. If it is, we will add it to a running total that starts at zero. After checking all the numbers, the running total will be the sum of all the negative numbers in the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a variable `sum_negative` to 0\n   For each number `num` in the list:\n       If `num` is less than 0:\n           Add `num` to `sum_negative`\n   Return `sum_negative`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_negativenum(numbers):\n    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of negative numbers\n    sum_negative = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for num in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is negative\n        if num < 0:\n            # Add the negative number to the sum\n            sum_negative += num\n    \n    # Return the total sum of negative numbers\n    return sum_negative\n```\n\nThis function will correctly calculate the sum of all negative numbers in the given list.",
