INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/133 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the negative numbers in that list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of negative numbers.
   - Iterate through each number in the list.
   - Check if the current number is negative.
   - If it is negative, add it to the sum.
   - After iterating through the list, return the sum of the negative numbers.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sum_negativenum(numbers):
       initialize sum_of_negatives to 0
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is less than 0:
               add number to sum_of_negatives
       return sum_of_negatives
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_negativenum(numbers):
    # Initialize the sum of negative numbers to 0
    sum_of_negatives = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is negative
        if number < 0:
            # Add the negative number to the sum
            sum_of_negatives += number
    
    # Return the total sum of negative numbers
    return sum_of_negatives
```

This function will correctly calculate the sum of all negative numbers in a given list, as required by the problem statement.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.
