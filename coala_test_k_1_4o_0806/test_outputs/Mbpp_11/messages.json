        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a string and a character as inputs. The function should remove the first and last occurrence of the specified character from the string and return the modified string.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the First Occurrence**: Find the index of the first occurrence of the specified character in the string.\n2. **Identify the Last Occurrence**: Find the index of the last occurrence of the specified character in the string.\n3. **Remove the Characters**: If the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., the character appears only once), remove it. Otherwise, remove both the first and last occurrences.\n4. **Return the Modified String**: Construct the new string without the first and last occurrences of the character and return it.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `remove_Occ` that takes two parameters: `s` (the string) and `char` (the character to remove).\n2. Find the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s` and store it in `first_index`.\n3. Find the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` and store it in `last_index`.\n4. If `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, remove the character at `first_index` from `s`.\n5. Otherwise, remove the characters at both `first_index` and `last_index` from `s`.\n6. Return the modified string.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef remove_Occ(s: str, char: str) -> str:\n    # Find the first occurrence of the character\n    first_index = s.find(char)\n    # Find the last occurrence of the character\n    last_index = s.rfind(char)\n    \n    # If the character is found\n    if first_index != -1:\n        # If the first and last occurrence are the same, remove it once\n        if first_index == last_index:\n            s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index+1:]\n        else:\n            # Remove the first occurrence\n            s = s[:first_index] + s[first_index+1:]\n            # Adjust last_index because the string is now shorter by one character\n            last_index -= 1\n            # Remove the last occurrence\n            s = s[:last_index] + s[last_index+1:]\n    \n    return s\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently removes the first and last occurrences of the specified character from the string and returns the modified string."

Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string. For each character in the string:\n           - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.\n           - If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack.\n           - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.\n           - Finally, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function removeDuplicates(s, k):\n               Initialize an empty stack\n       \n               for each character in s:\n                   if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:\n                       Increment the count of the top element in the stack\n                       if count equals k:\n                           Pop the top element from the stack\n                   else:\n                       Push (character, 1) onto the stack\n       \n               Initialize result as an empty string\n               for each (character, count) in stack:\n                   Append character repeated count times to result\n       \n               return result\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n                # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n                stack = []\n        \n                # Iterate over each character in the string\n                for char in s:\n                    if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                        # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character\n                        stack[-1][1] += 1  # Increment the count of the top element\n                        if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                            # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack\n                            stack.pop()\n                    else:\n                        # If the stack is empty or the top character is different, push the current character with count 1\n                        stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n                # Reconstruct the result string from the stack\n                result = ''\n                for char, count in stack:\n                    result += char * count  # Append the character repeated 'count' times\n        \n                return result\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently manages the removal of `k` adjacent duplicates using a stack, ensuring that the operations are performed in linear time relative to the length of the string.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['\"abcd\"', 2] Output: \"abcd\"\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
