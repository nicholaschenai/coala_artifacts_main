### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to find the smallest perfect square that is greater than a given integer. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, find the integer part of the square root of the given number. This will give us the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the given number.
   - Increment this integer by 1 to get the next integer.
   - Calculate the square of this new integer. This will be the next perfect square greater than the given number.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Compute the integer square root of the given number.
   - Increment this integer by 1.
   - Return the square of this incremented integer.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def next_Perfect_Square(n: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Find the integer part of the square root of n
    root = int(n**0.5)
    
    # Step 2: Increment the root by 1 to find the next integer
    next_root = root + 1
    
    # Step 3: Return the square of the next integer
    return next_root * next_root
```

This function calculates the next perfect square greater than the given number by following the steps outlined in the pseudocode.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.

    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.

    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. 

    Here is the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
            steps = 0
            while n != 1:
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    n //= 2
                else:
                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        n += 1
                steps += 1
            return steps
    ```

   We need to find the smallest perfect square that is greater than a given integer. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the next perfect square greater than a given number `n`, we can follow these steps:
   - Calculate the square root of `n` and round it up to the nearest whole number. This gives us the smallest integer whose square might be greater than `n`.
   - Square this integer to get the next perfect square.
   - Return this perfect square.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function next_Perfect_Square(n):
       calculate the square root of n
       round the square root up to the nearest integer, call it next_root
       calculate the square of next_root
       return the square
   ```

    next_root = int(root) + 1 if root % 1 != 0 else int(root) + 1
    # Calculate the square of the next_root
    next_square = next_root ** 2
    # Return the next perfect square
    return next_square
