    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the smallest perfect square that is greater than a given integer. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the next perfect square greater than a given number `n`, we can follow these steps:\n   - Calculate the square root of `n` and round it up to the nearest whole number. This gives us the smallest integer whose square might be greater than `n`.\n   - Square this integer to get the next perfect square.\n   - Return this perfect square.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function next_Perfect_Square(n):\n       calculate the square root of n\n       round the square root up to the nearest integer, call it next_root\n       calculate the square of next_root\n       return the square\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef next_Perfect_Square(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the square root of n\n    root = n ** 0.5\n    # Round up to the nearest whole number\n    next_root = int(root) + 1 if root % 1 != 0 else int(root) + 1\n    # Calculate the square of the next_root\n    next_square = next_root ** 2\n    # Return the next perfect square\n    return next_square\n```\n\nThis function calculates the next perfect square greater than the given number `n` by first determining the integer part of the square root of `n`, then incrementing it to find the next integer whose square will be greater than `n`. Finally, it returns the square of this integer.",
