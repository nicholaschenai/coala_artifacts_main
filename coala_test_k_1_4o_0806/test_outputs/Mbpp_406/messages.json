In simpler terms, the function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Parity**: Parity refers to whether a number is odd or even. A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2, and even if it is divisible by 2.\n2. **Determine Oddness**: To check if a number is odd, we can use the modulus operator `%`. If `number % 2` equals 1, the number is odd.\n3. **Return Result**: Based on the modulus operation, return `True` if the number is odd, otherwise return `False`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_Parity(number):\n    if number % 2 is not equal to 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_Parity(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is odd by using the modulus operator\n    # If the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero, it's odd\n    if number % 2 != 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function checks the parity of the input number and returns `True` if the number is odd, otherwise it returns `False`."

The key insight is that if you can leave your opponent with a disadvantageous position, you can secure a win.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Parity Analysis**: \n       - If \\( N = 1 \\), the player loses immediately because no moves are possible.\n       - If \\( N \\) is even, the player can always make it odd for the opponent, which is disadvantageous for them.\n       - If \\( N \\) is odd, the player can either subtract 1 or divide by an odd divisor, but the goal is to leave the opponent with an even number.\n\n    2. **Winning Strategy**:\n       - Always aim to leave the opponent with an odd number if possible, as it limits their options.\n       - For even numbers, you can always win by making it odd for the opponent.\n\n    ### Solution Approach:\n    - For each test case, check the value of \\( N \\):\n      - If \\( N = 1 \\), the Grinch wins.\n      - If \\( N \\) is even, you win.\n      - If \\( N \\) is odd, you also win because you can manipulate the number to eventually leave the Grinch with an even number.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def determine_winner(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            if N == 1:\n                results.append(\"Grinch\")\n            elif N % 2 == 0:\n                results.append(\"Me\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"Me\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of analyzing the structure of a game to determine winning and losing positions, especially using parity as a strategic tool.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
