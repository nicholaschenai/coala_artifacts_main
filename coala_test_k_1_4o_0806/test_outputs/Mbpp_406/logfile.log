## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that determines if a given integer has an odd parity. In simpler terms, the function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand Parity**: Parity refers to whether a number is odd or even. A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2, and even if it is divisible by 2.
2. **Determine Oddness**: To check if a number is odd, we can use the modulus operator `%`. If `number % 2` equals 1, the number is odd.
3. **Return Result**: Based on the modulus operation, return `True` if the number is odd, otherwise return `False`.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_Parity(number):
    if number % 2 is not equal to 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_Parity(number: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the number is odd by using the modulus operator
    # If the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero, it's odd
    if number % 2 != 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function checks the parity of the input number and returns `True` if the number is odd, otherwise it returns `False`.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept revolves around game theory and understanding winning and losing positions based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the integer \( N \). The key insight is that if you can leave your opponent with a disadvantageous position, you can secure a win.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Parity Analysis**: 
       - If \( N = 1 \), the player loses immediately because no moves are possible.
       - If \( N \) is even, the player can always make it odd for the opponent, which is disadvantageous for them.
       - If \( N \) is odd, the player can either subtract 1 or divide by an odd divisor, but the goal is to leave the opponent with an even number.

    2. **Winning Strategy**:
       - Always aim to leave the opponent with an odd number if possible, as it limits their options.
       - For even numbers, you can always win by making it odd for the opponent.

    ### Solution Approach:
    - For each test case, check the value of \( N \):
      - If \( N = 1 \), the Grinch wins.
      - If \( N \) is even, you win.
      - If \( N \) is odd, you also win because you can manipulate the number to eventually leave the Grinch with an even number.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def determine_winner(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            if N == 1:
                results.append("Grinch")
            elif N % 2 == 0:
                results.append("Me")
            else:
                results.append("Me")
        for result in results:
            print(result)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of analyzing the structure of a game to determine winning and losing positions, especially using parity as a strategic tool.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/406 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given number is odd. If the number is odd, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To determine if a number is odd, we can use the modulus operator `%`. A number is odd if it leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2. Therefore, we can check if the number modulo 2 equals 1. If it does, the number is odd, and we return `True`. If not, the number is even, and we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function find_Parity(number):
       if number % 2 == 1:
           return True
       else:
           return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_Parity(number: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the number is odd by using the modulus operator
    # If the remainder when divided by 2 is 1, the number is odd
    if number % 2 == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function will correctly determine the parity of a given number, returning `True` if the number is odd and `False` if it is even.
