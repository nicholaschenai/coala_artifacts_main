    "raw_msg": "Let's address the issue with the current implementation of the `get_ludic` function. The problem seems to be related to the logic used for removing every k-th number, which is causing a timeout. This suggests that the logic is not correctly implemented, leading to an infinite loop or excessive computation.\n\n### Correct Approach:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Start with a list of numbers from 1 to `n`.\n\n2. **Iterative Removal:**\n   - Continuously pick the first number in the list as a ludic number.\n   - Remove every k-th number from the list, where k is the current ludic number.\n   - Repeat this process until no more numbers can be removed.\n\n3. **Correct Removal Logic:**\n   - After identifying a ludic number, start removing every k-th number from the list, starting from the next number after the current ludic number.\n\nLet's implement the corrected logic:\n\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n: int) -> list:\n    # Create a list of numbers from 1 to n\n    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))\n    # Initialize an empty list to store ludic numbers\n    ludic_numbers = []\n    \n    # While there are numbers left in the list\n    while numbers:\n        # The first number in the list is a ludic number\n        ludic = numbers[0]\n        # Add it to the list of ludic numbers\n        ludic_numbers.append(ludic)\n        # Remove every ludic-th number from the list starting from the next number\n        numbers = [num for i, num in enumerate(numbers) if (i % ludic) != 0]\n    \n    # Return the list of ludic numbers\n    return ludic_numbers\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Correction:**\n- The list comprehension now correctly removes every k-th number by checking `(i % ludic) != 0`, which ensures that we start removing from the next number after the current ludic number.\n- This should correctly implement the sieve process for finding ludic numbers, avoiding infinite loops or excessive computation.",
