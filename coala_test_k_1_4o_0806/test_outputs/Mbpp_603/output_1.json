    "raw_msg": "Let's fix the solution based on the insights from the previous analysis. The main issue was with the removal process of the k-th numbers. We need to ensure that we correctly remove every k-th number starting from the next number after the current ludic number.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n: int) -> list:\n    # Create a list of numbers from 1 to n\n    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))\n    # Initialize an empty list to store ludic numbers\n    ludic_numbers = []\n    \n    # While there are numbers left in the list\n    while numbers:\n        # The first number in the list is a ludic number\n        ludic = numbers[0]\n        # Add it to the list of ludic numbers\n        ludic_numbers.append(ludic)\n        # Remove every ludic-th number from the list starting from the next number\n        numbers = [num for i, num in enumerate(numbers) if (i + 1) % ludic != 0 or i == 0]\n    \n    # Return the list of ludic numbers\n    return ludic_numbers\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Correction:**\n- The list comprehension now includes a condition `i == 0` to ensure the first element (the current ludic number) is not removed.\n- The removal condition `(i + 1) % ludic != 0` ensures that we start removing from the next number after the current ludic number. This should correctly implement the sieve process for finding ludic numbers.",
