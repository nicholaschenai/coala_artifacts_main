    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that finds all the \"ludic numbers\" that are less than or equal to a given integer `n`. A ludic number is a number that remains after repeatedly removing every k-th remaining number from a list of natural numbers starting from 1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find all ludic numbers up to a given number `n`, we can use a sieve-like process:\n   - Start with a list of numbers from 1 to `n`.\n   - Begin with the first number in the list (which is 1) and consider it as a ludic number.\n   - Remove every second number from the list (since 1 is the first number).\n   - Move to the next number in the list that hasn't been removed, consider it as a ludic number, and remove every k-th number where k is the current number.\n   - Repeat this process until you have iterated through the list.\n   - The remaining numbers in the list are the ludic numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function get_ludic(n):\n       create a list `numbers` containing numbers from 1 to n\n       initialize an empty list `ludic_numbers`\n       \n       while `numbers` is not empty:\n           take the first number from `numbers` as `ludic`\n           add `ludic` to `ludic_numbers`\n           remove every `ludic`-th number from `numbers` starting from the index of `ludic`\n       \n       return `ludic_numbers`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n: int) -> list:\n    # Create a list of numbers from 1 to n\n    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))\n    # Initialize an empty list to store ludic numbers\n    ludic_numbers = []\n    \n    # While there are numbers left in the list\n    while numbers:\n        # The first number in the list is a ludic number\n        ludic = numbers[0]\n        # Add it to the list of ludic numbers\n        ludic_numbers.append(ludic)\n        # Remove every ludic-th number from the list\n        numbers = [num for i, num in enumerate(numbers) if (i + 1) % ludic != 0]\n    \n    # Return the list of ludic numbers\n    return ludic_numbers\n```",
