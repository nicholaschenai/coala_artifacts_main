INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/567 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that checks if a given list of numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list is sorted, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through the list and compare each element with the next one.
   - If we find any element that is greater than the next element, we can conclude that the list is not sorted and return `False`.
   - If we complete the iteration without finding any such pair, the list is sorted, and we return `True`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function issort_list that takes a list as input
       For each index i from 0 to length of list - 2
           If the element at index i is greater than the element at index i + 1
               Return False
       Return True
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def issort_list(lst):
    # Iterate through the list up to the second last element
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        # Compare the current element with the next element
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            # If the current element is greater, the list is not sorted
            return False
    # If no such pair is found, the list is sorted
    return True
```

This function will correctly determine if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by checking each pair of consecutive elements. If any element is found to be greater than the next, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.
