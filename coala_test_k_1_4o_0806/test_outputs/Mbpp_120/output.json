    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two numbers. The function should calculate the product of the two numbers in each tuple, find the absolute value of each product, and then return the maximum absolute product from all the tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum absolute product found so far.\n   - Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, calculate the product of the two numbers.\n   - Take the absolute value of this product.\n   - If this absolute product is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum.\n   - After checking all tuples, return the maximum absolute product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_product_tuple(list_of_tuples):\n       initialize max_product to 0\n       for each tuple in list_of_tuples:\n           calculate product of the two numbers in the tuple\n           calculate absolute value of the product\n           if absolute product is greater than max_product:\n               update max_product with absolute product\n       return max_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_product_tuple(list_of_tuples):\n    # Initialize the maximum product to 0\n    max_product = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for a, b in list_of_tuples:\n        # Calculate the product of the two numbers in the tuple\n        product = a * b\n        # Calculate the absolute value of the product\n        abs_product = abs(product)\n        # If the absolute product is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum\n        if abs_product > max_product:\n            max_product = abs_product\n    \n    # Return the maximum absolute product found\n    return max_product\n```",
