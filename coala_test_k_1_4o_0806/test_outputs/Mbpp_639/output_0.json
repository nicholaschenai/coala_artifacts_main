    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of names as input. The function should remove any names that start with a lowercase letter and then calculate the total length of the remaining names. Finally, the function should return this total length.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start with an empty total length counter.\n   - Iterate over each name in the list.\n   - For each name, check if the first character is uppercase.\n   - If the name starts with an uppercase letter, add its length to the total length counter.\n   - After processing all names, return the total length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize total_length to 0\n   For each name in the list of names:\n       If the first character of the name is uppercase:\n           Add the length of the name to total_length\n   Return total_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sample_nam(names: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize the total length counter\n    total_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each name in the list\n    for name in names:\n        # Check if the first character of the name is uppercase\n        if name[0].isupper():\n            # Add the length of the name to the total length\n            total_length += len(name)\n    \n    # Return the total length of names that start with an uppercase letter\n    return total_length\n```",
