INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/639 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of names as input. The function should remove any names that start with a lowercase letter, then calculate and return the sum of the lengths of the remaining names.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total length of the names that start with an uppercase letter.
2. Iterate through each name in the list.
3. For each name, check if the first character is an uppercase letter.
4. If it is, add the length of that name to the total length.
5. After iterating through all the names, return the total length.

## Pseudocode

```
function sample_nam(names):
    initialize total_length to 0
    for each name in names:
        if the first character of name is uppercase:
            add the length of name to total_length
    return total_length
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def sample_nam(names: list) -> int:
    # Initialize the total length to 0
    total_length = 0
    
    # Iterate over each name in the list
    for name in names:
        # Check if the first character of the name is uppercase
        if name[0].isupper():
            # Add the length of the name to the total length
            total_length += len(name)
    
    # Return the total length of names that start with an uppercase letter
    return total_length
```

    Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

    Example:


    Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.

    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.

    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            if not nums:
                return 0
        
            n = len(nums)
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/639 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of names as input. The function should remove any names that start with a lowercase letter and then calculate the total length of the remaining names. Finally, the function should return this total length.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Start with an empty total length counter.
   - Iterate over each name in the list.
   - For each name, check if the first character is uppercase.
   - If the name starts with an uppercase letter, add its length to the total length counter.
   - After processing all names, return the total length.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize total_length to 0
   For each name in the list of names:
       If the first character of the name is uppercase:
