The function should remove any names that start with a lowercase letter, then calculate and return the sum of the lengths of the remaining names.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total length of the names that start with an uppercase letter.\n2. Iterate through each name in the list.\n3. For each name, check if the first character is an uppercase letter.\n4. If it is, add the length of that name to the total length.\n5. After iterating through all the names, return the total length.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction sample_nam(names):\n    initialize total_length to 0\n    for each name in names:\n        if the first character of name is uppercase:\n            add the length of name to total_length\n    return total_length\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef sample_nam(names: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize the total length to 0\n    total_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each name in the list\n    for name in names:\n        # Check if the first character of the name is uppercase\n        if name[0].isupper():\n            # Add the length of the name to the total length\n            total_length += len(name)\n    \n    # Return the total length of names that start with an uppercase letter\n    return total_length\n```"

The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.\n\n    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.\n\n    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            n = len(nums)\n            d = [1] * n\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
