Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to calculate the sum of a series that starts with a given number `n` and decreases by 2 in each subsequent term until the term becomes zero or negative. Specifically, the series is: `n, n-2, n-4, ...,` and so on. We need to sum all these terms.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can:\n- Start with the initial number `n`.\n- Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum.\n- Use a loop to iterate over the series, decreasing the term by 2 each time.\n- Add each term to the sum until the term becomes zero or negative.\n- Return the sum.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction sum_series(n):\n    initialize sum to 0\n    for i from 0 to n // 2 (inclusive):\n        calculate term as n - 2 * i\n        add term to sum\n    return sum\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef sum_series(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the series from i = 0 to n // 2\n    for i in range(n // 2 + 1):\n        # Calculate the current term in the series\n        term = n - 2 * i\n        \n        # Add the current term to the total sum\n        total_sum += term\n    \n    # Return the total sum of the series\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the sum of the series as described in the problem statement."

However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:\n\n    1. **Formula Derivation**:\n       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.\n\n    2. **Handling the First Term**:\n       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**:\n       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.\n\n    4. **Code Simplicity**:\n       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.\n\n    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

For example, if `n` is 6, the series would be 6, 4, 2, and the sum would be 12.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate from 0 to `n // 2` (inclusive) and calculate each term in the series as `n - 2*i`. We then add each term to a running total. This will give us the sum of the series.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0\n   For each integer `i` from 0 to n // 2 (inclusive):\n       Calculate the term as `n - 2*i`\n       Add the term to `total_sum`\n   Return `total_sum`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_series(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate from 0 to n // 2 (inclusive)\n    for i in range(n // 2 + 1):\n        # Calculate the current term in the series\n        term = n - 2 * i\n        # Add the term to the total sum\n        total_sum += term\n    \n    # Return the total sum of the series\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis function calculates the sum of the series by iterating over the range from 0 to `n // 2` and adding each term `n - 2*i` to the total sum. The loop ensures that we only consider terms that are greater than 0."
