    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of a series starting from `n` and decreasing by 2 each time, until the value becomes less than or equal to 0. For example, if `n` is 6, the series would be 6, 4, 2, and the sum would be 12.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate from 0 to `n // 2` (inclusive) and calculate each term in the series as `n - 2*i`. We then add each term to a running total. This will give us the sum of the series.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0\n   For each integer `i` from 0 to n // 2 (inclusive):\n       Calculate the term as `n - 2*i`\n       Add the term to `total_sum`\n   Return `total_sum`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_series(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate from 0 to n // 2 (inclusive)\n    for i in range(n // 2 + 1):\n        # Calculate the current term in the series\n        term = n - 2 * i\n        # Add the term to the total sum\n        total_sum += term\n    \n    # Return the total sum of the series\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis function calculates the sum of the series by iterating over the range from 0 to `n // 2` and adding each term `n - 2*i` to the total sum. The loop ensures that we only consider terms that are greater than 0.",
