For example, if `n` is 2, we need to find the sum of the fourth powers of the first two odd numbers, which are 1 and 3.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, identify the first `n` odd natural numbers. Odd numbers start from 1 and increase by 2 each time (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...).\n   - For each of these odd numbers, calculate its fourth power.\n   - Sum all these fourth powers to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to keep track of the total sum.\n   - Loop through the first `n` odd numbers:\n     - Calculate the fourth power of the current odd number.\n     - Add this fourth power to `sum`.\n   - Return the value of `sum`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_num_sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n odd numbers\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Calculate the i-th odd number: 2*i + 1\n        odd_number = 2 * i + 1\n        \n        # Calculate the fourth power of the odd number\n        fourth_power = odd_number ** 4\n        \n        # Add the fourth power to the sum\n        sum += fourth_power\n    \n    # Return the total sum\n    return sum\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers."

The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.\n    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.\n    - This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).\n\n    ### Implementation:\n    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.\n    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
