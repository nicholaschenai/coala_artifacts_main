INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/770 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we need to find the sum of the fourth powers of the first two odd numbers, which are 1 and 3.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, identify the first `n` odd natural numbers. Odd numbers start from 1 and increase by 2 each time (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...).
   - For each of these odd numbers, calculate its fourth power.
   - Sum all these fourth powers to get the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to keep track of the total sum.
   - Loop through the first `n` odd numbers:
     - Calculate the fourth power of the current odd number.
     - Add this fourth power to `sum`.
   - Return the value of `sum`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def odd_num_sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    
    # Loop through the first n odd numbers
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the i-th odd number: 2*i + 1
        odd_number = 2 * i + 1
        
        # Calculate the fourth power of the odd number
        fourth_power = odd_number ** 4
        
        # Add the fourth power to the sum
        sum += fourth_power
    
    # Return the total sum
    return sum
```

This function will correctly compute the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.

    ### Strategy:
    - I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.
    - This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).

    ### Implementation:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.
