    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we need to find the sum of the fourth powers of the first two odd numbers, which are 1 and 3.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Generate the first `n` odd natural numbers.\n   - Calculate the fourth power of each of these numbers.\n   - Sum up all these fourth powers to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function odd_num_sum(n):\n       Initialize sum to 0\n       For i from 0 to n-1:\n           Calculate the i-th odd number as 2*i + 1\n           Calculate the fourth power of this odd number\n           Add the fourth power to sum\n       Return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_num_sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n odd numbers\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Calculate the i-th odd number\n        odd_number = 2 * i + 1\n        # Calculate the fourth power of the odd number\n        fourth_power = odd_number ** 4\n        # Add the fourth power to the total sum\n        total_sum += fourth_power\n    \n    # Return the total sum of fourth powers\n    return total_sum\n```",
