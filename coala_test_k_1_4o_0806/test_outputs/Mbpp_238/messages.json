        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the number of non-empty substrings for a given string. A substring is any sequence of characters that appears consecutively within the string. For example, the string \"abc\" has the following non-empty substrings: \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"ab\", \"bc\", and \"abc\".\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the number of non-empty substrings of a string, we can use the following approach:\n   - For a string of length `n`, the number of non-empty substrings can be calculated using the formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n   - This formula works because for each character in the string, we can form substrings starting from that character to the end of the string. For example, for a string of length 3 (\"abc\"), the substrings are:\n     - Starting from the first character: \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\"\n     - Starting from the second character: \"b\", \"bc\"\n     - Starting from the third character: \"c\"\n   - The total number of substrings is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function number_of_substrings(s):\n       n = length of s\n       return n * (n + 1) / 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef number_of_substrings(s: str) -> int:\n    # Calculate the length of the string\n    n = len(s)\n    # Use the formula to calculate the number of non-empty substrings\n    # The formula is n * (n + 1) / 2\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n```\n\nThis function calculates the number of non-empty substrings by using the mathematical formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which efficiently gives us the desired result."

However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:\n\n    1. **Formula Derivation**:\n       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.\n\n    2. **Handling the First Term**:\n       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**:\n       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.\n\n    4. **Code Simplicity**:\n       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.\n\n    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
