    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find all numbers within a specified range (from `startnum` to `endnum`) where each number is divisible by each of its digits. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 1 and 2, so it should be included in the result.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Iterate through each number in the given range.\n   - For each number, check if it is divisible by each of its digits.\n   - If a number is divisible by all its digits, add it to the result list.\n   - Return the list of such numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):\n       result = []\n       for number from startnum to endnum:\n           convert number to string to iterate over each digit\n           set divisible = True\n           for each digit in number:\n               if digit is '0' or number is not divisible by digit:\n                   set divisible = False\n                   break\n           if divisible is True:\n               add number to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef divisible_by_digits(startnum: int, endnum: int) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store numbers that meet the criteria\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the range from startnum to endnum (inclusive)\n    for number in range(startnum, endnum + 1):\n        # Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit\n        num_str = str(number)\n        \n        # Assume the number is divisible by all its digits until proven otherwise\n        divisible = True\n        \n        # Check each digit in the number\n        for digit in num_str:\n            # Convert the digit back to an integer\n            digit_int = int(digit)\n            \n            # If the digit is 0 or the number is not divisible by this digit, set divisible to False\n            if digit_int == 0 or number % digit_int != 0:\n                divisible = False\n                break\n        \n        # If the number is divisible by all its digits, add it to the result list\n        if divisible:\n            result.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of numbers that are divisible by all their digits\n    return result\n```",
