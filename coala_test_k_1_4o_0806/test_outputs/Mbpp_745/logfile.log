INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/745 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that finds all numbers within a specified range (from `startnum` to `endnum`) where each number is divisible by every digit it contains. For example, the number 12 is divisible by both 1 and 2, so it should be included in the result.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate through each number in the range from `startnum` to `endnum`.
2. For each number, check if it is divisible by each of its digits.
3. If a number is divisible by all of its digits, add it to the result list.
4. Return the list of numbers that meet the criteria.

## Pseudocode

```
function divisible_by_digits(startnum, endnum):
    initialize an empty list called result
    for each number in the range from startnum to endnum (inclusive):
        convert the number to a string to iterate over its digits
        set a flag divisible to True
        for each digit in the string representation of the number:
            convert the digit back to an integer
            if the digit is 0 or the number is not divisible by the digit:
                set divisible to False
                break the loop
        if divisible is True:
            append the number to the result list
    return the result list
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def divisible_by_digits(startnum: int, endnum: int) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the specified range
    for num in range(startnum, endnum + 1):
        # Convert the number to a string to access each digit
        num_str = str(num)
        # Assume the number is divisible by all its digits
        divisible = True
        
        # Check each digit
        for digit_char in num_str:
            digit = int(digit_char)
            # If the digit is 0 or the number is not divisible by the digit
            if digit == 0 or num % digit != 0:
                divisible = False
                break
        
        # If the number is divisible by all its digits, add it to the result
        if divisible:
            result.append(num)
    
    # Return the list of numbers that are divisible by all their digits
    return result

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to compute the sums of all non-empty continuous subarrays of a given array, sort these sums, and then calculate the sum of a specified range of these sorted sums. The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.
    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.
    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.
    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
            subarray_sums = []
            for start in range(n):
                current_sum = 0
                for end in range(start, n):
                    current_sum += nums[end]
                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
            subarray_sums.sort()
            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])
            return result % (10**9 + 7)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.
