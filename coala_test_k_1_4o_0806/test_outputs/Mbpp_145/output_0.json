    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array of integers. The difference should be calculated as the absolute difference between the two elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the maximum absolute difference between any two elements in the array, we can follow these steps:\n   - Identify the smallest and largest elements in the array.\n   - The maximum absolute difference will be the difference between the largest and smallest elements.\n   - Return this difference as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_Abs_Diff(arr):\n       if the array is empty:\n           return 0\n       find the minimum element in the array\n       find the maximum element in the array\n       calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum elements\n       return the difference\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_Abs_Diff(arr: tuple) -> int:\n    # If the array is empty, return 0 as there are no elements to compare\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Find the minimum element in the array\n    min_element = min(arr)\n    \n    # Find the maximum element in the array\n    max_element = max(arr)\n    \n    # Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum elements\n    max_difference = max_element - min_element\n    \n    # Return the maximum difference\n    return max_difference\n```",
