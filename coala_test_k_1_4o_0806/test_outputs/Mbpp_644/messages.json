The function should reverse the elements of the array from the start up to the `k`-th position (exclusive), and leave the rest of the array unchanged.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will take the input array and the integer `k`.\n   - We will reverse the portion of the array from the start up to the `k`-th position.\n   - We will concatenate this reversed portion with the rest of the array starting from the `k`-th position.\n   - Finally, we will return the modified array.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):\n       - Reverse the subarray from index 0 to k-1\n       - Concatenate the reversed subarray with the rest of the array starting from index k\n       - Return the concatenated array\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):\n    # Reverse the subarray from the start up to the k-th position (exclusive)\n    reversed_part = arr[:k][::-1]\n    \n    # Concatenate the reversed part with the rest of the array starting from k\n    result = reversed_part + arr[k:]\n    \n    # Return the final array\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will reverse the elements of the array up to the specified position `k` and return the modified array."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.\n    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.\n    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.\n    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n            prefix_sums = {0: 1}\n            current_sum = 0\n            count = 0\n        \n            for num in nums:\n                current_sum += num\n                needed_sum = current_sum - k\n                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]\n                if current_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1\n                else:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1\n        \n            return count\n    ```\n\n    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
