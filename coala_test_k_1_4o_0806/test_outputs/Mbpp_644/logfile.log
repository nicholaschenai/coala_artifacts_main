INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/644 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes an array and an integer `k` as inputs. The function should reverse the elements of the array from the start up to the `k`-th position (exclusive), and leave the rest of the array unchanged.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will take the input array and the integer `k`.
   - We will reverse the portion of the array from the start up to the `k`-th position.
   - We will concatenate this reversed portion with the rest of the array starting from the `k`-th position.
   - Finally, we will return the modified array.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):
       - Reverse the subarray from index 0 to k-1
       - Concatenate the reversed subarray with the rest of the array starting from index k
       - Return the concatenated array
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):
    # Reverse the subarray from the start up to the k-th position (exclusive)
    reversed_part = arr[:k][::-1]
    
    # Concatenate the reversed part with the rest of the array starting from k
    result = reversed_part + arr[k:]
    
    # Return the final array
    return result
```

This function will reverse the elements of the array up to the specified position `k` and return the modified array.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.
    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.

    ### Strategy:
    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.
    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.
    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            prefix_sums = {0: 1}
            current_sum = 0
            count = 0
        
            for num in nums:
                current_sum += num
                needed_sum = current_sum - k
                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:
                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]
                if current_sum in prefix_sums:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
                else:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1
        
            return count
    ```

    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.

   function reverse_Array_Upto_K(arr, k):
       if k is greater than the length of arr:
           return arr (no change needed)
       reverse the subarray from index 0 to k-1
