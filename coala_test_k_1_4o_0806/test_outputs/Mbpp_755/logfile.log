## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the second smallest number in that list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Unique Values**: First, we need to ensure that we are considering only unique numbers in the list. This is important because if the smallest number appears multiple times, we still need to find the second smallest distinct number.
   
2. **Sort the Unique Values**: Once we have a list of unique numbers, we can sort this list in ascending order.

3. **Select the Second Smallest**: After sorting, the second element in this sorted list will be the second smallest number.

## Pseudocode

1. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
2. Convert the set back to a list.
3. Sort the list of unique numbers.
4. Return the second element from the sorted list.

## Python Code

```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    # Step 1: Remove duplicates by converting the list to a set
    unique_numbers = set(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Convert the set back to a list
    unique_numbers = list(unique_numbers)
    
    # Step 3: Sort the list of unique numbers
    unique_numbers.sort()
    
    # Step 4: Return the second element from the sorted list
    return unique_numbers[1]
```

This function will correctly find the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates, sorting the unique numbers, and then selecting the second element from the sorted list.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I implemented a system called ANGEN to perform various operations on a list of integers. The core concepts involved handling different types of queries efficiently, including updating values, calculating sums, and finding maximum, minimum, second maximum, and second minimum values within specified ranges. The challenge was to ensure that each operation was performed correctly and efficiently, given the constraints.

    The key strategy was to use a list to store the integers, allowing for direct access and updates. For operations like finding the second maximum or minimum, I used a set to handle unique values and sorted them to find the desired result. This approach ensured that the operations were both correct and efficient.

    One potential pitfall was handling the indices correctly, as the input uses 1-based indexing while Python lists use 0-based indexing. Adjusting the indices appropriately was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors. Additionally, handling invalid operations and edge cases, such as when there are not enough unique values to find a second maximum or minimum, was important to ensure robustness.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of careful index management and the use of sets for handling unique values in range-based operations. The solution was successful, passing all test cases without any errors.

   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second smallest number in that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the second smallest number in a list, we can follow these steps:
   - First, identify the smallest number in the list.
   - Then, iterate through the list again to find the smallest number that is larger than the first smallest number. This will be the second smallest number.
   - If the list has fewer than two unique numbers, the second smallest number does not exist, but based on the problem statement, we assume the list will always have at least two unique numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function second_smallest(numbers):
       if length of numbers is less than 2:
           return None (or handle as per problem constraints)
       
       set first_smallest to infinity
       set second_smallest to infinity
       
       for each number in numbers:
           if number is less than first_smallest:
               set second_smallest to first_smallest
               set first_smallest to number

       return second_smallest
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def second_smallest(numbers):
    # Initialize the first and second smallest numbers to infinity
    first_smallest = float('inf')
    second_smallest = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # If the current number is smaller than the first smallest
        if number < first_smallest:
            # Update the second smallest to be the previous first smallest
            second_smallest = first_smallest
            # Update the first smallest to be the current number
            first_smallest = number
