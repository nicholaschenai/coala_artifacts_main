    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the second smallest number in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the second smallest number in a list, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, identify the smallest number in the list.\n   - Then, iterate through the list again to find the smallest number that is larger than the first smallest number. This will be the second smallest number.\n   - If the list has fewer than two unique numbers, the second smallest number does not exist, but based on the problem statement, we assume the list will always have at least two unique numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function second_smallest(numbers):\n       if length of numbers is less than 2:\n           return None (or handle as per problem constraints)\n       \n       set first_smallest to infinity\n       set second_smallest to infinity\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           if number is less than first_smallest:\n               set second_smallest to first_smallest\n               set first_smallest to number\n           else if number is greater than first_smallest and number is less than second_smallest:\n               set second_smallest to number\n       \n       return second_smallest\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef second_smallest(numbers):\n    # Initialize the first and second smallest numbers to infinity\n    first_smallest = float('inf')\n    second_smallest = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # If the current number is smaller than the first smallest\n        if number < first_smallest:\n            # Update the second smallest to be the previous first smallest\n            second_smallest = first_smallest\n            # Update the first smallest to be the current number\n            first_smallest = number\n        # If the current number is greater than the first smallest but smaller than the second smallest\n        elif first_smallest < number < second_smallest:\n            # Update the second smallest to be the current number\n            second_smallest = number\n    \n    # Return the second smallest number found\n    return second_smallest\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find the second smallest number in a list of numbers, assuming the list contains at least two unique numbers.",
