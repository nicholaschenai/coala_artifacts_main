INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/419 [generation text] Sure, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The function should return this final result.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

- First, we will round each number in the list to the nearest integer.
- Next, we will calculate the sum of these rounded numbers.
- We will then determine the length of the list.
- Finally, we will multiply the sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the list and return the result.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function round_and_sum(numbers):
    initialize a variable rounded_sum to 0
    for each number in the list numbers:
        round the number to the nearest integer
        add the rounded number to rounded_sum
    calculate the length of the list numbers
    multiply rounded_sum by the length of the list
    return the result
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def round_and_sum(numbers):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of rounded numbers
    rounded_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Round the number to the nearest integer and add it to the sum
        rounded_sum += round(number)
    
    # Calculate the length of the list
    length_of_list = len(numbers)
    
    # Multiply the sum of rounded numbers by the length of the list
    result = rounded_sum * length_of_list
    
    # Return the final result
    return result
```

This code will correctly round each number in the list, sum them up, and then multiply the sum by the length of the list, as required by the problem statement.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to calculate the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 10 and are less than or equal to a given number "N" for multiple test cases. The core concept here was recognizing that multiples of 10 form an arithmetic series, which can be efficiently summed using a mathematical formula.

    Key steps included:
    1. **Identifying the Largest Multiple of 10**: For a given N, the largest multiple of 10 is `N // 10 * 10`.
    2. **Using the Arithmetic Series Formula**: The sum of multiples of 10 up to this largest multiple can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `Sum = (number of terms) * (first term + last term) / 2`.

    The solution involved reading multiple test cases, computing the sum for each using the above logic, and then outputting the results. This approach was efficient and handled the constraints well, especially given the large possible value of N (up to 1 billion).

    The problem reinforced the importance of recognizing patterns in sequences and leveraging mathematical formulas for efficient computation. The implementation was straightforward, and no unexpected errors were encountered. This experience highlighted the utility of arithmetic series in solving problems involving sequences of numbers.
