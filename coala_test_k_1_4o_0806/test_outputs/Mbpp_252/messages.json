The polar coordinate representation of a complex number consists of two values: the magnitude (or modulus) and the angle (or argument) in radians.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Magnitude Calculation**: The magnitude of a complex number \\( z = a + bi \\) is calculated using the formula \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n2. **Angle Calculation**: The angle (or argument) is calculated using the `atan2` function, which computes the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments, taking into account the signs of both arguments to determine the correct quadrant of the angle. For a complex number \\( z = a + bi \\), the angle is \\( \\text{atan2}(b, a) \\).\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `convert` that takes a single argument `z`.\n2. Extract the real part `a` and the imaginary part `b` from the complex number `z`.\n3. Calculate the magnitude using the formula \\( \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n4. Calculate the angle using the `atan2` function with `b` and `a` as arguments.\n5. Return a tuple containing the magnitude and the angle.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef convert(z: complex) -> tuple:\n    # Extract real and imaginary parts\n    a = z.real\n    b = z.imag\n    \n    # Calculate magnitude\n    magnitude = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)\n    \n    # Calculate angle\n    angle = math.atan2(b, a)\n    \n    # Return the polar coordinates as a tuple\n    return (magnitude, angle)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `convert` that takes a complex number `z` and returns its polar coordinates as a tuple. The magnitude is calculated using the square root of the sum of squares of the real and imaginary parts, and the angle is calculated using the `atan2` function to ensure the correct quadrant is considered."

The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) given these constraints.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \\( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \\).\n    - **Area Formula**: The area \\( S \\) is given by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b = S \\).\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \\( b = \\frac{2S}{a} \\) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \\( a \\).\n    - **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.\n    - **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.\n    - **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.\n    - **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    import math\n\n    def find_triangle_sides():\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            H = int(data[index])\n            S = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            if 2 * S > H * H:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n                continue\n        \n            try:\n                discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S\n                if discriminant < 0:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                    continue\n            \n                a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n                a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n            \n                b1 = 2 * S / a1\n                b2 = 2 * S / a2\n            \n                if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n            except ValueError:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n    \n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    find_triangle_sides()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation and precision handling in computational geometry problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
