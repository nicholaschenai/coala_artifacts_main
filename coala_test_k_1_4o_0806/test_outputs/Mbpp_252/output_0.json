    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that converts a complex number into its polar coordinates. The function should return a tuple containing the magnitude (or modulus) and the phase (or argument) of the complex number. The function should be named `convert` and should work correctly for the test case provided: `convert(1)` should return `(1.0, 0.0)`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To convert a complex number to polar coordinates, we need to calculate two values:\n   - The magnitude (or modulus) of the complex number, which is the distance from the origin to the point in the complex plane. This can be calculated using the formula: `magnitude = sqrt(real_part^2 + imaginary_part^2)`.\n   - The phase (or argument) of the complex number, which is the angle formed with the positive real axis. This can be calculated using the `atan2` function: `phase = atan2(imaginary_part, real_part)`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function convert with parameter z\n       Extract real and imaginary parts from z\n       Calculate magnitude using sqrt(real^2 + imag^2)\n       Calculate phase using atan2(imag, real)\n       Return a tuple (magnitude, phase)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef convert(z: complex) -> tuple:\n    # Extract the real and imaginary parts of the complex number\n    real_part = z.real\n    imaginary_part = z.imag\n    \n    # Calculate the magnitude (modulus) of the complex number\n    magnitude = math.sqrt(real_part**2 + imaginary_part**2)\n    \n    # Calculate the phase (argument) of the complex number\n    phase = math.atan2(imaginary_part, real_part)\n    \n    # Return the magnitude and phase as a tuple\n    return (magnitude, phase)\n```\n\nThis function uses the `math` module to compute the square root and the arctangent, which are necessary for converting a complex number to its polar form. The function returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase of the complex number.",
