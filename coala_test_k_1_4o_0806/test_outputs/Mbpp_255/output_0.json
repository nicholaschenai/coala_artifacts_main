    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of elements and an integer `n`, and generates all possible combinations of the elements with repetition allowed, where each combination has a length of `n`. The function should return these combinations as a list of tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach to generate combinations with repetition. The idea is to build combinations by selecting each element from the list and recursively building the rest of the combination. If the desired length `n` is reached, we add the combination to the result list. This process is repeated for each element in the list, allowing repetition.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a helper function `generate_combinations` that takes the current combination, the list, and the desired length `n`.\n       If the length of the current combination is equal to `n`, add it to the result list.\n       Otherwise, for each element in the list:\n           Append the element to the current combination.\n           Recursively call `generate_combinations` with the updated combination.\n           Remove the last element to backtrack.\n\n   Define the main function `combinations_colors` that takes a list and an integer `n`.\n       Initialize an empty list to store the result.\n       Call `generate_combinations` with an empty combination, the list, and `n`.\n       Return the result list.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef generate_combinations(current_combination, elements, n, result):\n    # If the current combination has reached the desired length, add it to the result\n    if len(current_combination) == n:\n        result.append(tuple(current_combination))\n        return\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in elements:\n        # Add the element to the current combination\n        current_combination.append(element)\n        # Recursively generate combinations with the updated combination\n        generate_combinations(current_combination, elements, n, result)\n        # Remove the last element to backtrack\n        current_combination.pop()\n\ndef combinations_colors(elements, n):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    # Start the recursive generation of combinations\n    generate_combinations([], elements, n, result)\n    # Return the list of combinations\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code defines a recursive function to generate all combinations of a given length with repetition allowed, and returns them as a list of tuples.",
