    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a list of lists, where each sublist contains numbers. Our task is to find the sublist whose sum of elements is the highest and return that sublist.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each sublist in the list of lists. For each sublist, we calculate the sum of its elements. We keep track of the sublist with the highest sum encountered so far. At the end of the iteration, we return the sublist with the highest sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a variable `max_sum` to a very small number (e.g., negative infinity)\n   Initialize a variable `max_list` to None\n\n   For each sublist in the list of lists:\n       Calculate the sum of the sublist\n       If the sum is greater than `max_sum`:\n           Update `max_sum` to this sum\n           Update `max_list` to this sublist\n\n   Return `max_list`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_sum_list(lists):\n    # Initialize max_sum to a very small number\n    max_sum = float('-inf')\n    # Initialize max_list to None\n    max_list = None\n\n    # Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in lists:\n        # Calculate the sum of the current sublist\n        current_sum = sum(sublist)\n        # If the current sum is greater than max_sum, update max_sum and max_list\n        if current_sum > max_sum:\n            max_sum = current_sum\n            max_list = sublist\n\n    # Return the sublist with the maximum sum\n    return max_list\n```\n\nThis code iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. It returns the sublist with the maximum sum at the end.",
