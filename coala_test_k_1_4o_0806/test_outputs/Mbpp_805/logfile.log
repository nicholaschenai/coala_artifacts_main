INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/805 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input. Each inner list contains numbers. The function should return the inner list that has the highest sum of its elements.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the list with the maximum sum found so far.
   - Iterate over each list in the list of lists.
   - For each list, calculate the sum of its elements.
   - If the sum of the current list is greater than the sum of the list stored in the variable, update the variable to the current list.
   - After checking all lists, return the list stored in the variable.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function max_sum_list(list_of_lists):
       max_list = None
       max_sum = -infinity
       
       for each list in list_of_lists:
           current_sum = sum of elements in list
           if current_sum > max_sum:
               max_sum = current_sum
               max_list = list
       
       return max_list
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def max_sum_list(list_of_lists):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the list with the maximum sum
    max_list = None
    max_sum = float('-inf')  # Start with the smallest possible number
    
    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        # Calculate the sum of the current list
        current_sum = sum(lst)
        
        # If the current sum is greater than the max sum found so far
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            # Update the max sum and the list with the max sum
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = lst
    
    # Return the list with the maximum sum
    return max_list
```

This code will correctly identify and return the list with the highest sum from a list of lists.

    [Task]:
        There is a pizza with 3n slices of varying size, you and your friends will take slices of pizza as follows:

        You will pick any pizza slice.
        Your friend AliceÂ will pickÂ next slice in anti clockwise direction of your pick.Â 
        Your friend BobÂ willÂ pickÂ next slice in clockwise direction of your pick.
        RepeatÂ untilÂ there are no more slices of pizzas.

        Sizes of Pizza slices is represented by circular array slices in clockwise direction.
        Return the maximum possible sum of slice sizes which you can have.
Â 
        Example 1:

        Input: slices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
        Output: 10
        Explanation: Pick pizza slice of size 4, Alice and Bob will pick slices with size 3 and 5 respectively. Then Pick slices with size 6, finally Alice and Bob will pick slice of size 2 and 1 respectively. Total = 4 + 6.

        Example 2:

        Input: slices = [8,9,8,6,1,1]
        Output: 16
        Output: Pick pizza slice of size 8 in each turn. If you pick slice with size 9 your partners will pick slices of size 8.

        Example 3:
        Input: slices = [4,1,2,5,8,3,1,9,7]
        Output: 21

        Example 4:
        Input: slices = [3,1,2]
        Output: 3

Â 
        Constraints:

        1 <= slices.length <= 500
        slices.length % 3 == 0
        1 <= slices[i] <= 1000

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We have a circular array of pizza slices, and the number of slices is a multiple of 3. You, Alice, and Bob will take turns picking slices. You pick a slice first, then Alice picks the next slice in the counter-clockwise direction, and Bob picks the next slice in the clockwise direction. The goal is to maximize the sum of the sizes of the slices you pick.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Since the array is circular, we need to consider two scenarios to avoid picking adjacent slices:
           - Consider the array from the first slice to the second-to-last slice.
           - Consider the array from the second slice to the last slice.
   
           For each scenario, use dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of slices you can pick, ensuring that you skip two slices after each pick (one for Alice and one for Bob). The final result will be the maximum of the two scenarios.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Define a helper function maxSlices(slices, n):
               Initialize a dp array of size len(slices) with all zeros
               Set dp[0] to slices[0]
               Set dp[1] to max(slices[0], slices[1])
       
               For i from 2 to len(slices) - 1:
                   dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + slices[i])
       
               Return dp[len(slices) - 1]
   
           In the main function maxSizeSlices(slices):
               Calculate n as len(slices) // 3
               Calculate max1 as maxSlices(slices[0:len(slices)-1], n)
               Calculate max2 as maxSlices(slices[1:len(slices)], n)
               Return max(max1, max2)
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        from typing import List

        class Solution:
            def maxSizeSlices(self, slices: List[int]) -> int:
                # Helper function to calculate the maximum sum of slices
                def maxSlices(slices: List[int], n: int) -> int:
                    # Initialize a dp array to store the maximum sum up to each slice
                    dp = [0] * len(slices)
                    dp[0] = slices[0]
                    dp[1] = max(slices[0], slices[1])
            
                    # Fill the dp array using the recurrence relation
                    for i in range(2, len(slices)):
                        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + slices[i])
            
                    # The last element of dp contains the maximum sum for this scenario
                    return dp[-1]
        
                # Calculate the number of slices you can pick
                n = len(slices) // 3
        
                # Consider two scenarios to handle the circular nature of the array
                max1 = maxSlices(slices[:-1], n)
                max2 = maxSlices(slices[1:], n)
        
                # Return the maximum of the two scenarios
                return max(max1, max2)
        ```

        This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the maximum sum of slices you can pick, considering the circular nature of the array and the constraints of the problem.
