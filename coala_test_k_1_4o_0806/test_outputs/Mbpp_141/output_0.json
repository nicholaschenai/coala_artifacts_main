    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that sorts a list of integers using a specific sorting algorithm called \"pancake sort\". The function should take a list of integers as input and return a sorted list of those integers.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Pancake Sort**: Pancake sorting is a sorting algorithm that uses a series of \"flips\" to sort a list. A flip is an operation that reverses the order of the first k elements of the list. The goal is to sort the list using the minimum number of flips.\n\n2. **Algorithm Steps**:\n   - Start from the end of the list and move backwards.\n   - For each position, find the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list.\n   - Flip the list to bring this maximum element to the front.\n   - Flip the list again to move this maximum element to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion.\n   - Repeat the process for the next largest element until the entire list is sorted.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**: Consider cases where the list is already sorted or contains duplicate elements.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction pancake_sort(arr):\n    n = length of arr\n    for curr_size from n to 1:\n        max_index = find the index of the maximum element in arr[0:curr_size]\n        if max_index != curr_size - 1:\n            flip(arr, max_index + 1)  # Bring the max element to the front\n            flip(arr, curr_size)      # Move the max element to its correct position\n    return arr\n\nfunction flip(arr, k):\n    reverse the first k elements of arr\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef flip(arr, k):\n    # Reverse the first k elements of the array\n    start = 0\n    while start < k - 1:\n        arr[start], arr[k - 1] = arr[k - 1], arr[start]\n        start += 1\n        k -= 1\n\ndef pancake_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Start from the complete array and reduce the size each time\n    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):\n        # Find the index of the maximum element in arr[0:curr_size]\n        max_index = 0\n        for i in range(1, curr_size):\n            if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:\n                max_index = i\n        # If the maximum element is not at its correct position\n        if max_index != curr_size - 1:\n            # Bring the maximum element to the front\n            flip(arr, max_index + 1)\n            # Move the maximum element to its correct position\n            flip(arr, curr_size)\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis solution implements the pancake sort algorithm, which sorts the list by repeatedly flipping the largest unsorted element to its correct position. The `flip` function reverses the first `k` elements of the list, and the `pancake_sort` function orchestrates the sorting process.",
