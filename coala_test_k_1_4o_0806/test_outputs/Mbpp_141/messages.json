Pancake sorting involves repeatedly flipping sublists of the array to sort it. The process is similar to sorting pancakes by size using a spatula, where you can flip the top `k` pancakes at a time.\n\n   The steps for pancake sorting are:\n   - Find the largest unsorted element in the list.\n   - Flip the list up to that element to bring it to the front.\n   - Flip the entire unsorted portion of the list to move the largest element to its correct position at the end.\n   - Reduce the size of the unsorted portion and repeat until the list is sorted.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function pancake_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       for i from n to 1:\n           max_index = find the index of the maximum element in arr[0:i]\n           if max_index != i-1:\n               flip(arr, max_index + 1)  // Bring the max element to the front\n               flip(arr, i)              // Move the max element to its correct position\n       return arr\n\n   function flip(arr, k):\n       reverse the first k elements of arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef flip(arr, k):\n    # Reverse the first k elements of the array\n    left = 0\n    right = k - 1\n    while left < right:\n        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n\ndef pancake_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Iterate from the end of the list to the beginning\n    for i in range(n, 1, -1):\n        # Find the index of the maximum element in the unsorted portion\n        max_index = 0\n        for j in range(1, i):\n            if arr[j] > arr[max_index]:\n                max_index = j\n        # If the maximum element is not already in its correct position\n        if max_index != i - 1:\n            # Flip the maximum element to the front\n            flip(arr, max_index + 1)\n            # Flip it to its correct position\n            flip(arr, i)\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the pancake sorting algorithm, which sorts the list by repeatedly flipping sublists to move the largest unsorted element to its correct position."

However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.\n        However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, \u2026, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:\n        123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \\, 2 \\, 3 \\quad    1 \\, 3 \\, 2 \\quad     2 \\, 1 \\, 3 \\quad     2 \\, 3 \\, 1 \\quad     3 \\, 1 \\, 2 \\quad     3 \\, 2 \\, 1 \n        The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, \u2026, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,\u2026,N$.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.\n\n        -----Constraints:-----\n        - $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$.\n        - $1 \\leq K \\leq 10$.\n\n        -----Sample input-----\n        3 2\n        3 1 2\n        2 3 1\n\n        -----Sample output-----\n        3 2 1\n        3 1 2\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ### Problem Restatement\n\n        Given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N, the task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. We are provided with K permutations, and for each permutation, we need to output its next permutation in lexicographic order.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in increasing order.\n\n        2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:\n           - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair of consecutive elements where the earlier element is smaller than the later one. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.\n           - Swap this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger than it.\n           - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position of the first element to get the smallest possible order.\n\n        3. **Edge Case**: If the permutation is the largest possible (i.e., in descending order), the next permutation is the smallest possible (i.e., in ascending order).\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function next_permutation(perm):\n            n = length of perm\n            i = n - 2\n            while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:\n                i -= 1\n            if i >= 0:\n                j = n - 1\n                while perm[j] <= perm[i]:\n                    j -= 1\n                swap perm[i] and perm[j]\n            reverse perm from i + 1 to end\n            return perm\n\n        function main():\n            read N and K\n            for each of K permutations:\n                read permutation\n                print next_permutation(permutation)\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def next_permutation(perm):\n            n = len(perm)\n            i = n - 2\n            # Find the first decreasing element from the end\n            while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:\n                i -= 1\n            if i >= 0:\n                j = n - 1\n                # Find the element just larger than perm[i]\n                while perm[j] <= perm[i]:\n                    j -= 1\n                # Swap them\n                perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]\n            # Reverse the sequence from i+1 to end\n            perm[i + 1:] = reversed(perm[i + 1:])\n            return perm\n\n        def main():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            N = int(data[0])\n            K = int(data[1])\n            index = 2\n    \n            results = []\n            for _ in range(K):\n                permutation = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))\n                index += N\n                next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)\n                results.append(\" \".join(map(str, next_perm)))\n    \n            for result in results:\n                print(result)\n\n        # Call the main function to execute the logic\n        main()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **next_permutation**: This function implements the logic to find the next permutation in lexicographic order.\n        - **main**: This function handles input and output.

The function should take a list of integers as input and return a sorted list of those integers.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Pancake Sort**: Pancake sorting is a sorting algorithm that uses a series of \"flips\" to sort a list. A flip is an operation that reverses the order of the first k elements of the list. The goal is to sort the list using the minimum number of flips.\n\n2. **Algorithm Steps**:\n   - Start from the end of the list and move backwards.\n   - For each position, find the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list.\n   - Flip the list to bring this maximum element to the front.\n   - Flip the list again to move this maximum element to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion.\n   - Repeat the process for the next largest element until the entire list is sorted.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**: Consider cases where the list is already sorted or contains duplicate elements.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction pancake_sort(arr):\n    n = length of arr\n    for curr_size from n to 1:\n        max_index = find the index of the maximum element in arr[0:curr_size]\n        if max_index != curr_size - 1:\n            flip(arr, max_index + 1)  # Bring the max element to the front\n            flip(arr, curr_size)      # Move the max element to its correct position\n    return arr\n\nfunction flip(arr, k):\n    reverse the first k elements of arr\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef flip(arr, k):\n    # Reverse the first k elements of the array\n    start = 0\n    while start < k - 1:\n        arr[start], arr[k - 1] = arr[k - 1], arr[start]\n        start += 1\n        k -= 1\n\ndef pancake_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Start from the complete array and reduce the size each time\n    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):\n        # Find the index of the maximum element in arr[0:curr_size]\n        max_index = 0\n        for i in range(1, curr_size):\n            if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:\n                max_index = i\n        # If the maximum element is not at its correct position\n        if max_index != curr_size - 1:\n            # Bring the maximum element to the front\n            flip(arr, max_index + 1)\n            # Move the maximum element to its correct position\n            flip(arr, curr_size)\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis solution implements the pancake sort algorithm, which sorts the list by repeatedly flipping the largest unsorted element to its correct position. The `flip` function reverses the first `k` elements of the list, and the `pancake_sort` function orchestrates the sorting process."
