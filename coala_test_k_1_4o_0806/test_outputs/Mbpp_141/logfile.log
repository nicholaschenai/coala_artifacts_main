1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function called `pancake_sort` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   The problem suggests using a sorting algorithm, and given the function name `pancake_sort`, it implies using the pancake sorting algorithm. Pancake sorting involves repeatedly flipping sublists of the array to sort it. The process is similar to sorting pancakes by size using a spatula, where you can flip the top `k` pancakes at a time.

   The steps for pancake sorting are:
   - Find the largest unsorted element in the list.
   - Flip the list up to that element to bring it to the front.
   - Flip the entire unsorted portion of the list to move the largest element to its correct position at the end.
   - Reduce the size of the unsorted portion and repeat until the list is sorted.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function pancake_sort(arr):
       n = length of arr
       for i from n to 1:
           max_index = find the index of the maximum element in arr[0:i]
           if max_index != i-1:
               flip(arr, max_index + 1)  // Bring the max element to the front
               flip(arr, i)              // Move the max element to its correct position
       return arr

   function flip(arr, k):
       reverse the first k elements of arr
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def flip(arr, k):
    # Reverse the first k elements of the array
    left = 0
    right = k - 1
    while left < right:
        arr[left], arr[right] = arr[right], arr[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1

def pancake_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Iterate from the end of the list to the beginning
    for i in range(n, 1, -1):
        # Find the index of the maximum element in the unsorted portion
        max_index = 0
        for j in range(1, i):
            if arr[j] > arr[max_index]:
                max_index = j
        # If the maximum element is not already in its correct position
        if max_index != i - 1:
            # Flip the maximum element to the front
            flip(arr, max_index + 1)
            # Flip it to its correct position
            flip(arr, i)
    return arr
```

This code implements the pancake sorting algorithm, which sorts the list by repeatedly flipping sublists to move the largest unsorted element to its correct position.

    [Task]:
        It is an interesting exercise to write a program to print out all permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$. However, since there are $6227020800$ permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, 13$, it is unlikely that we would ever run this program on an input of size more than $10$.
        However, here is another interesting problem whose solution can also be used to generate permutations. We can order the permutations of $1, 2, â€¦, n$ under the lexicographic (or dictionary) order. Here are the permutations of $1,2,3$ in lexicographic order:
        123132213231312321123132213231312321 1 \, 2 \, 3 \quad    1 \, 3 \, 2 \quad     2 \, 1 \, 3 \quad     2 \, 3 \, 1 \quad     3 \, 1 \, 2 \quad     3 \, 2 \, 1 
        The problem we have is the following: given a permutation of $1,2, â€¦, n$, generate the next permutation in lexicographic order. For example, for $2 3 1 4$ the answer is $2 3 4 1$.

        -----Input:-----
        The first line of the input contains two integers, $N$ and $K$. This is followed by $K$ lines, each of which contains one permutation of $1, 2,â€¦,N$.

        -----Output:-----
        The output should consist of $K$ lines. Line $i$ should contain the lexicographically next permutation correponding to the permutation on line $i+1$ in the input.

        -----Constraints:-----
        - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$.
        - $1 \leq K \leq 10$.

        -----Sample input-----
        3 2
        3 1 2

        ### Problem Restatement

        Given a permutation of numbers from 1 to N, the task is to find the next permutation in lexicographic order. We are provided with K permutations, and for each permutation, we need to output its next permutation in lexicographic order.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Lexicographic Order**: Lexicographic order is similar to dictionary order. For permutations, it means arranging numbers in increasing order.

        2. **Finding the Next Permutation**:
           - Start from the end of the permutation and find the first pair of consecutive elements where the earlier element is smaller than the later one. This identifies the point where the order can be increased.
           - Swap this element with the smallest element to its right that is larger than it.
           - Reverse the sequence to the right of the original position of the first element to get the smallest possible order.

        3. **Edge Case**: If the permutation is the largest possible (i.e., in descending order), the next permutation is the smallest possible (i.e., in ascending order).

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function next_permutation(perm):
            n = length of perm
            i = n - 2
            while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
                i -= 1
            if i >= 0:
                j = n - 1
                while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
                    j -= 1
                swap perm[i] and perm[j]
            reverse perm from i + 1 to end
            return perm

        function main():
            read N and K
            for each of K permutations:
                read permutation
                print next_permutation(permutation)
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def next_permutation(perm):
            n = len(perm)
            i = n - 2
            # Find the first decreasing element from the end
            while i >= 0 and perm[i] >= perm[i + 1]:
                i -= 1
            if i >= 0:
                j = n - 1
                # Find the element just larger than perm[i]
                while perm[j] <= perm[i]:
                    j -= 1
                # Swap them
                perm[i], perm[j] = perm[j], perm[i]
            # Reverse the sequence from i+1 to end
            perm[i + 1:] = reversed(perm[i + 1:])
            return perm

        def main():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            N = int(data[0])
            K = int(data[1])
            index = 2
    
            results = []
            for _ in range(K):
                permutation = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
                index += N
                next_perm = next_permutation(permutation)
                results.append(" ".join(map(str, next_perm)))
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the main function to execute the logic
        main()
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **next_permutation**: This function implements the logic to find the next permutation in lexicographic order.
        - **main**: This function handles input and output. It reads the input, processes each permutation using `next_permutation`, and prints the results.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/141 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that sorts a list of integers using a specific sorting algorithm called "pancake sort". The function should take a list of integers as input and return a sorted list of those integers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Pancake Sort**: Pancake sorting is a sorting algorithm that uses a series of "flips" to sort a list. A flip is an operation that reverses the order of the first k elements of the list. The goal is to sort the list using the minimum number of flips.

2. **Algorithm Steps**:
   - Start from the end of the list and move backwards.
   - For each position, find the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list.
   - Flip the list to bring this maximum element to the front.
   - Flip the list again to move this maximum element to its correct position at the end of the unsorted portion.
   - Repeat the process for the next largest element until the entire list is sorted.

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider cases where the list is already sorted or contains duplicate elements.

### Pseudocode

```
function pancake_sort(arr):
    n = length of arr
    for curr_size from n to 1:
        max_index = find the index of the maximum element in arr[0:curr_size]
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(arr, max_index + 1)  # Bring the max element to the front
            flip(arr, curr_size)      # Move the max element to its correct position
    return arr

function flip(arr, k):
    reverse the first k elements of arr
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def flip(arr, k):
    # Reverse the first k elements of the array
    start = 0
    while start < k - 1:
        arr[start], arr[k - 1] = arr[k - 1], arr[start]
        start += 1
        k -= 1

def pancake_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Start from the complete array and reduce the size each time
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        # Find the index of the maximum element in arr[0:curr_size]
        max_index = 0
        for i in range(1, curr_size):
            if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
                max_index = i
        # If the maximum element is not at its correct position
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            # Bring the maximum element to the front
            flip(arr, max_index + 1)
            # Move the maximum element to its correct position
            flip(arr, curr_size)
    return arr
```

This solution implements the pancake sort algorithm, which sorts the list by repeatedly flipping the largest unsorted element to its correct position. The `flip` function reverses the first `k` elements of the list, and the `pancake_sort` function orchestrates the sorting process.
