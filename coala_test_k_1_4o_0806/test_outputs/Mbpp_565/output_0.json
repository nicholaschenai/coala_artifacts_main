    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of its individual characters.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate over each character in the input string and collect them into a list. This can be done using a simple list comprehension or a loop that appends each character to a list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function split(s):\n       Initialize an empty list called characters\n       For each character in the string s:\n           Append the character to the list characters\n       Return the list characters\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef split(s: str) -> list:\n    # Use a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string\n    # and collect them into a list\n    return [char for char in s]\n```\n\nThis solution uses a list comprehension to efficiently create a list of characters from the input string. Each character in the string is added to the list, resulting in a list of individual characters.",
