INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/230 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a string and a character as inputs. The function should replace all blank spaces in the string with the given character and return the modified string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We can solve this problem by iterating over the string and checking each character. If a character is a blank space, we replace it with the specified character. We can use Python's built-in string method `replace` to achieve this efficiently.

3. **Pseudocode Solution:**
   - Define a function `replace_blank` that takes two parameters: `input_string` and `replacement_char`.
   - Use the `replace` method of the string to replace all occurrences of the space character `' '` with `replacement_char`.
   - Return the modified string.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def replace_blank(input_string: str, replacement_char: str) -> str:
    # Use the replace method to replace all spaces with the replacement character
    modified_string = input_string.replace(' ', replacement_char)
    # Return the modified string
    return modified_string
```

This solution uses the `replace` method, which is a straightforward and efficient way to replace all occurrences of a specified substring (in this case, a space) with another substring (the replacement character).

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of determining if the string "abacaba" can be placed exactly once in a given string with question marks, the core concept was to identify potential positions for "abacaba" and ensure it appears exactly once after replacing question marks. The problem tested the ability to manipulate strings and handle multiple test cases efficiently.

    Initially, the solution logic was encapsulated in a function, but it wasn't called, leading to no output. This highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed, especially in competitive programming settings where input/output is handled through standard IO.

    The strategy that worked involved:
    1. Iterating over each possible starting position in the string to check if "abacaba" could be placed by replacing question marks.
    2. Replacing remaining question marks with a filler character ('z') to complete the string.
    3. Verifying that "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string.

    The unexpected error of no output was fixed by explicitly calling the `solve()` function, ensuring the logic was executed. This experience reinforced the importance of verifying function calls and understanding input/output handling in script-based environments. The final solution efficiently handled multiple test cases and correctly determined the possibility of placing "abacaba" exactly once.
