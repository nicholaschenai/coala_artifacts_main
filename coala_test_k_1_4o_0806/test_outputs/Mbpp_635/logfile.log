INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/635 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to implement a function called `heap_sort` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list with the integers sorted in ascending order. The function should use the heap sort algorithm to achieve this.

### Conceptual Solution

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. The algorithm consists of two main phases:

1. **Build a Max Heap**: Convert the input list into a max heap, where the largest element is at the root of the heap.

2. **Sort the List**: Repeatedly extract the maximum element from the heap and place it at the end of the list. Then, reduce the size of the heap by one and heapify the root element to maintain the max heap property.

The process of heapifying involves ensuring that a subtree rooted at a given index satisfies the max heap property, where each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a helper function `heapify(arr, n, i)`:
   - Set `largest` as `i`.
   - Calculate `left` as `2 * i + 1` and `right` as `2 * i + 2`.
   - If `left` is within bounds and `arr[left]` is greater than `arr[largest]`, update `largest` to `left`.
   - If `right` is within bounds and `arr[right]` is greater than `arr[largest]`, update `largest` to `right`.
   - If `largest` is not `i`, swap `arr[i]` and `arr[largest]`, and recursively call `heapify` on the affected subtree.

2. Define the main function `heap_sort(arr)`:
   - Get the length of the list `n`.
   - Build a max heap by calling `heapify` for all non-leaf nodes from `n//2 - 1` to `0`.
   - For each element from `n-1` to `1`:
     - Swap the root of the heap with the current element.
     - Reduce the heap size by one.
     - Call `heapify` on the root to maintain the max heap property.

3. Return the sorted list.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def heapify(arr, n, i):
    # Initialize largest as root
    largest = i
    left = 2 * i + 1  # left = 2*i + 1
    right = 2 * i + 2  # right = 2*i + 2

    # If left child is larger than root
    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:
        largest = left

    # If right child is larger than largest so far
    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:
        largest = right

    # If largest is not root
    if largest != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]  # swap

        # Recursively heapify the affected sub-tree
        heapify(arr, n, largest)

def heap_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Build a maxheap
    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):
        heapify(arr, n, i)

    # One by one extract elements
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]  # swap
        heapify(arr, i, 0)

    return arr
```

This code implements the heap sort algorithm by first building a max heap and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element to sort the list.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was efficiently managing a sequence of events where citizens declare their wealth and the king visits to behead the richest citizen who has appeared so far. The challenge was to quickly identify and remove the richest citizen who is still alive at each king's visit.

    The key strategy was to use a max-heap to keep track of the wealth of citizens as they appear. By negating the wealth values, we could simulate a max-heap using Python's list sorting. This allowed us to efficiently extract the richest citizen when the king visits. Additionally, a set was used to track which citizens had already been beheaded, ensuring that only living citizens were considered during each visit.

    One potential pitfall was ensuring that the heap operations were efficient, especially given the constraints with large numbers of citizens and visits. The solution involved careful management of the heap and the beheaded set to maintain performance. This approach worked well, and the solution passed all test cases without any unexpected errors.
