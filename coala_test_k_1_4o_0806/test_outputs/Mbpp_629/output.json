    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Iterate through the list**: We will go through each number in the list.\n2. **Check if the number is even**: For each number, we will check if it is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). A number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.\n3. **Collect even numbers**: If a number is even, we will add it to a new list.\n4. **Return the list of even numbers**: After checking all numbers, we will return the list containing only the even numbers.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction Split(numbers):\n    initialize an empty list called even_numbers\n    for each number in numbers:\n        if number is even (number % 2 == 0):\n            add number to even_numbers\n    return even_numbers\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef Split(numbers):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store even numbers\n    even_numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If it is even, add it to the even_numbers list\n            even_numbers.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of even numbers\n    return even_numbers\n```",
