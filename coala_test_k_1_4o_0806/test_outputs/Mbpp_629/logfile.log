1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function named `Split` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each number in the input list.
   - For each number, we will check if it is even. A number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.
   - If a number is even, we will add it to a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list of even numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function Split with parameter numbers (a list of integers)
       Initialize an empty list called even_numbers
       For each number in numbers
           If the number is even (number % 2 == 0)
               Append the number to even_numbers
       Return even_numbers
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def Split(numbers):
    # Initialize an empty list to store even numbers
    even_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is even
        if number % 2 == 0:
            # If it is even, append it to the even_numbers list
            even_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the list of even numbers
    return even_numbers
```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The official solution provides an insightful approach to solving the problem by focusing on the gaps between odd numbers. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:

    1. **Identify Gaps Between Odds**: The solution first identifies the lengths of contiguous even numbers between odd numbers. This is done by iterating through the array and counting the number of even numbers until an odd number is encountered. Each time an odd number is found, the count of even numbers (plus one) is stored in a list called `edge`.

    2. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the number of odd numbers in the array is less than `k`, the function immediately returns 0, as it's impossible to have a subarray with `k` odd numbers.

    3. **Calculate Subarrays**: For each possible starting position of a subarray with exactly `k` odd numbers, the solution calculates the number of valid subarrays by multiplying the number of ways to choose the starting even numbers and the ending even numbers. This is done using the `edge` list, where `edge[i]` represents the number of ways to extend the subarray to the left, and `edge[i+k]` represents the number of ways to extend it to the right.

    This approach is efficient because it reduces the problem to counting combinations of even numbers around odd numbers, rather than explicitly iterating over all possible subarrays. It leverages the fact that the number of ways to form a subarray with `k` odd numbers is determined by the even numbers surrounding those odd numbers. This method is both time-efficient and easy to understand once the concept of counting even-number gaps is clear.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/629 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Iterate through the list**: We will go through each number in the list.
2. **Check if the number is even**: For each number, we will check if it is even by using the modulus operator (`%`). A number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.
3. **Collect even numbers**: If a number is even, we will add it to a new list.
4. **Return the list of even numbers**: After checking all numbers, we will return the list containing only the even numbers.

## Pseudocode

```
function Split(numbers):
    initialize an empty list called even_numbers
    for each number in numbers:
        if number is even (number % 2 == 0):
            add number to even_numbers
    return even_numbers
```

def Split(numbers):
