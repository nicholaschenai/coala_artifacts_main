        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes two tuples as input and checks if each element in the second tuple is smaller than the corresponding element in the first tuple. If all elements in the second tuple are smaller than their corresponding elements in the first tuple, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.\n2. For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will check if the element from the second tuple is smaller than the element from the first tuple.\n3. If we find any element in the second tuple that is not smaller than its corresponding element in the first tuple, we will return `False`.\n4. If we complete the iteration without finding any such element, we will return `True`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n    for each index i in range of length of tuple1:\n        if tuple2[i] is not smaller than tuple1[i]:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_smaller(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Check if the element in the second tuple is not smaller than the element in the first tuple\n        if tuple2[i] >= tuple1[i]:\n            # If any element in the second tuple is not smaller, return False\n            return False\n    # If all elements in the second tuple are smaller, return True\n    return True\n```"

The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.\n\n    #### Key Insights and Strategies\n\n    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.\n\n    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N = test_case[0]\n            A = test_case[1]\n        \n            current_sum = 0\n            possible = True\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                current_sum += A[i]\n                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n        \n            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
