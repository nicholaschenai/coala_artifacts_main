INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/445 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes two tuples of tuples as input. Each inner tuple contains two integers. The function should perform element-wise multiplication of the integers in the corresponding positions of the inner tuples from both input tuples. The result should be a new tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the products of the corresponding elements.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate over the pairs of inner tuples from the two input tuples.
2. For each pair of inner tuples, we will multiply the first elements together and the second elements together.
3. We will store the results of these multiplications in a new tuple.
4. Finally, we will return a tuple containing all the result tuples.

## Pseudocode

1. Define the function `index_multiplication` that takes two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
2. Initialize an empty list `result`.
3. Loop over the pairs of inner tuples from `tuple1` and `tuple2` using `zip`.
   - For each pair `(a, b)` from `tuple1` and `(c, d)` from `tuple2`:
     - Calculate the product of the first elements: `product1 = a * c`.
     - Calculate the product of the second elements: `product2 = b * d`.
     - Append the tuple `(product1, product2)` to `result`.
4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple and return it.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def index_multiplication(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result tuples
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over pairs of inner tuples from tuple1 and tuple2
    for (a, b), (c, d) in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        # Calculate the products of corresponding elements
        product1 = a * c
        product2 = b * d
        # Append the result tuple to the result list
        result.append((product1, product2))
    
    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        ### Problem Restatement

        We need to compute the sum \( S(N, K) \) for multiple queries, where \( S(N, K) \) is defined as the sum of the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers raised to the power of \( K \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
        - \( F_0 = 0 \)
        - \( F_1 = 1 \)
        - \( F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \)

        Given the constraints, \( N \) and \( K \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), which means we need an efficient way to compute the Fibonacci numbers and their powers.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        1. **Fibonacci Calculation**: Use matrix exponentiation to compute Fibonacci numbers efficiently. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using matrix exponentiation, which allows us to compute the \( N \)-th Fibonacci number in \( O(\log N) \) time.

        2. **Sum of Powers**: Once we have the Fibonacci numbers, we need to compute the sum of their powers. Direct computation is infeasible due to the size of \( N \) and \( K \). Instead, we can use properties of modular arithmetic and fast exponentiation to compute powers efficiently.

        3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the numbers can be very large, we will use a modulo operation with a large prime number (e.g., \( 10^9 + 7 \)) to keep the numbers manageable and prevent overflow.

        ### Pseudocode

        1. Define a function `matrix_mult` to multiply two 2x2 matrices.
        2. Define a function `matrix_pow` to perform matrix exponentiation.
        3. Define a function `fibonacci` to compute the \( N \)-th Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.
        4. Define a function `fast_exp` to compute \( a^b \mod m \) using fast exponentiation.
        5. For each query:
           - Compute the first \( N \) Fibonacci numbers using the `fibonacci` function.
           - Compute the sum of these Fibonacci numbers raised to the power \( K \) using `fast_exp`.
           - Output the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

        ### Python Code

        ```python
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        def matrix_mult(A, B, mod):
            return [[(A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0]) % mod, (A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1]) % mod],

            result = 1
            while exp > 0:
                if exp % 2 == 1:
                    result = (result * base) % mod
                base = (base * base) % mod
                exp //= 2
            return result

        def solve():
            import sys

            index += 1
    
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(Q):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                sum_fib = 0
                for i in range(N + 1):
                    fib_i = fibonacci(i, MOD)
                    sum_fib = (sum_fib + fib_i) % MOD
        
                result = fast_exp(sum_fib, K, MOD)
                results.append(result)
    
            sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(map(str, results)) + '\n')

        ```

        This code efficiently computes the required sum of Fibonacci numbers raised to a power for each query, using matrix exponentiation and fast exponentiation techniques.

We need to create a function that takes two tuples of tuples as input. Each inner tuple contains two integers. The function should perform element-wise multiplication of the corresponding elements in the tuples and return a new tuple of tuples with the results.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Structure**: We have two tuples, each containing multiple tuples of two integers.
2. **Output Structure**: We need to return a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the products of the corresponding elements from the input tuples.
3. **Process**:
   - Iterate over the pairs of tuples from the two input tuples.
   - For each pair of tuples, multiply the corresponding elements.
   - Store the result as a new tuple.
   - Collect all these result tuples into a final tuple.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `index_multiplication` that takes two tuples of tuples as input.
2. Initialize an empty list `result`.
3. For each pair of tuples `(a, b)` from the input tuples:
   - Multiply the first elements of the tuples: `a[0] * b[0]`.
   - Multiply the second elements of the tuples: `a[1] * b[1]`.
   - Append the resulting tuple `(a[0] * b[0], a[1] * b[1])` to the `result` list.
4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple and return it.

### Python Code

```python
def index_multiplication(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result tuples
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the pairs of tuples from the two input tuples
    for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        # Multiply the corresponding elements and create a new tuple
        multiplied_tuple = (a[0] * b[0], a[1] * b[1])

        result.append(multiplied_tuple)
    
    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
```

This code will correctly perform index-wise multiplication of the elements in the given tuples and return the expected result.
