    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list as input and returns the count of elements in the list that are integers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each element in the list and check if it is an integer. We can use Python's built-in `isinstance()` function to determine if an element is an integer. We will maintain a counter that increments each time we find an integer in the list. Finally, we will return the counter as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function count_integer that takes a list as input\n       Initialize a counter to 0\n       For each element in the list\n           If the element is an integer\n               Increment the counter\n       Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_integer(lst):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of integer elements\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # Check if the current element is an integer\n        if isinstance(element, int):\n            # Increment the counter if it is an integer\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of integer elements\n    return count\n```",
