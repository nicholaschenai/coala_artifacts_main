INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/253 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list as input and returns the count of elements in the list that are integers.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each element in the list.
   - For each element, we will check if it is an integer.
   - We will maintain a counter to keep track of how many integers we have encountered.
   - Finally, we will return the counter as the result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function named count_integer that takes a list as input.
   Initialize a counter to 0.
   For each element in the list:
       Check if the element is an integer.
       If it is, increment the counter by 1.
   Return the counter.
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def count_integer(lst):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of integer elements
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for element in lst:
        # Check if the current element is an integer
        if isinstance(element, int):
            # Increment the counter if the element is an integer
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of integer elements
    return count
```

This function will correctly count and return the number of integer elements in the provided list.

    Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

    Example:


    Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.

    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.

    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. 

    Here is the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
            steps = 0
            while n != 1:
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    n //= 2
                else:
                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        n += 1
                steps += 1
            return steps
    ```

   We need to write a function that takes a list as input and returns the count of elements in the list that are integers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each element in the list and check if it is an integer. We can use Python's built-in `isinstance()` function to determine if an element is an integer. We will maintain a counter that increments each time we find an integer in the list. Finally, we will return the counter as the result.
