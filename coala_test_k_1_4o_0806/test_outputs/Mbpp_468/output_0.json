    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum product that can be formed by multiplying numbers from an increasing subsequence in a given list of integers. An increasing subsequence is a sequence where each number is greater than the one before it.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach similar to finding the longest increasing subsequence. We'll maintain an array where each element represents the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at that index. For each element in the list, we'll check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we'll update the maximum product for the current element by multiplying it with the maximum product of the previous element. Finally, we'll return the maximum value from this array.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_product(arr):\n       if arr is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       n = length of arr\n       max_product = array of size n initialized with arr values\n       \n       for i from 1 to n-1:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   max_product[i] = max(max_product[i], max_product[j] * arr[i])\n       \n       return maximum value in max_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_product(arr):\n    # If the array is empty, return 0 as there are no subsequences\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n    \n    n = len(arr)\n    # Initialize the max_product array with the values of arr\n    max_product = arr[:]\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the array starting from the second element\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                # Update the max_product for the current element\n                max_product[i] = max(max_product[i], max_product[j] * arr[i])\n    \n    # Return the maximum value from the max_product array\n    return max(max_product)\n```",
