INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/606 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that converts an angle given in degrees to radians. The function should take a single input, which is the angle in degrees, and return the equivalent angle in radians.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To convert degrees to radians, we use the formula: radians = degrees Ã— (Ï€ / 180). This formula is derived from the fact that 180 degrees is equivalent to Ï€ radians. Therefore, to convert any degree value to radians, we multiply the degree value by Ï€ and divide by 180.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `radian_degree` that takes one parameter `degrees`.
   - Inside the function, calculate the radians using the formula: `radians = degrees * (Ï€ / 180)`.
   - Return the calculated radians.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def radian_degree(degrees: float) -> float:
    # Define the value of Ï€ (pi)
    pi = 3.141592653589793
    # Convert degrees to radians using the formula: radians = degrees * (Ï€ / 180)
    radians = degrees * (pi / 180)
    # Return the calculated radians
    return radians
```

This function will correctly convert an angle from degrees to radians using the mathematical relationship between the two units.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to convert a number into a specified base, with the default being Ï€. The challenge was to handle both integer and fractional parts of the number and return the result as a string. The function needed to accommodate non-integer bases, which added complexity to the conversion process.

    ### Core Concepts:
    - **Base Conversion**: The problem required converting numbers to bases that could be non-integer, such as Ï€. This involves handling both integer and fractional parts separately.
    - **Handling Non-Integer Bases**: Unlike typical base conversions, non-integer bases require careful handling of division and modulus operations.

    ### Strategies and Challenges:
    - **Integer Part Conversion**: Initially, the conversion logic for the integer part was not correctly handling non-integer bases. The use of integer division and modulus operations needed to be adapted for non-integer bases.
    - **Fractional Part Conversion**: Multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting digits worked well, but ensuring precision with the specified number of decimal places was crucial.

    ### Errors and Fixes:
    - **Incorrect Integer Conversion**: The main issue was with the integer part conversion when using non-integer bases. Adjusting the logic to correctly handle division and modulus operations for non-integer bases was key.
    - **Zero Handling**: Ensuring that the integer part is represented as '0' when necessary was a simple but important fix.

    ### Final Solution:
    The final solution involved correctly adapting the conversion logic for non-integer bases and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts were handled accurately. The function now correctly converts numbers to the specified base, including non-integer bases like Ï€, and formats the result as expected.
