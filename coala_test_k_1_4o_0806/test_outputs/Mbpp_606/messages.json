        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to write a function that converts an angle given in degrees to radians. The function should take a single input, which is the angle in degrees, and return the equivalent angle in radians.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - To convert degrees to radians, we use the formula: radians = degrees \u00d7 (\u03c0 / 180). This formula is derived from the fact that 180 degrees is equivalent to \u03c0 radians. Therefore, to convert any degree value to radians, we multiply the degree value by \u03c0 and divide by 180.\n\n### Pseudocode Solution\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `radian_degree` that takes one parameter `degrees`.\n   - Inside the function, calculate the radians using the formula: `radians = degrees * (\u03c0 / 180)`.\n   - Return the calculated radians.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef radian_degree(degrees: float) -> float:\n    # Define the value of \u03c0 (pi)\n    pi = 3.141592653589793\n    # Convert degrees to radians using the formula: radians = degrees * (\u03c0 / 180)\n    radians = degrees * (pi / 180)\n    # Return the calculated radians\n    return radians\n```\n\nThis function will correctly convert an angle from degrees to radians using the mathematical relationship between the two units."

The challenge was to handle both integer and fractional parts of the number and return the result as a string. The function needed to accommodate non-integer bases, which added complexity to the conversion process.\n\n    ### Core Concepts:\n    - **Base Conversion**: The problem required converting numbers to bases that could be non-integer, such as \u03c0. This involves handling both integer and fractional parts separately.\n    - **Handling Non-Integer Bases**: Unlike typical base conversions, non-integer bases require careful handling of division and modulus operations.\n\n    ### Strategies and Challenges:\n    - **Integer Part Conversion**: Initially, the conversion logic for the integer part was not correctly handling non-integer bases. The use of integer division and modulus operations needed to be adapted for non-integer bases.\n    - **Fractional Part Conversion**: Multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting digits worked well, but ensuring precision with the specified number of decimal places was crucial.\n\n    ### Errors and Fixes:\n    - **Incorrect Integer Conversion**: The main issue was with the integer part conversion when using non-integer bases. Adjusting the logic to correctly handle division and modulus operations for non-integer bases was key.\n    - **Zero Handling**: Ensuring that the integer part is represented as '0' when necessary was a simple but important fix.\n\n    ### Final Solution:\n    The final solution involved correctly adapting the conversion logic for non-integer bases and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts were handled accurately. The function now correctly converts numbers to the specified base, including non-integer bases like \u03c0, and formats the result as expected.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
