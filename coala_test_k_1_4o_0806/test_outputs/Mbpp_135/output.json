    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth hexagonal number. A hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot at each vertex. The nth hexagonal number can be calculated using a specific formula.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The formula to find the nth hexagonal number is given by: \n   \\[\n   H_n = n \\times (2n - 1)\n   \\]\n   This formula directly gives us the nth hexagonal number. We will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth hexagonal number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function hexagonal_num(n):\n       Calculate hexagonal number using formula: n * (2 * n - 1)\n       Return the calculated hexagonal number\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef hexagonal_num(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula\n    # H_n = n * (2n - 1)\n    hexagonal_number = n * (2 * n - 1)\n    return hexagonal_number\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the nth hexagonal number using the formula provided.",
