INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/135 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the nth hexagonal number. A hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot at each vertex and along each side. The nth hexagonal number can be calculated using a specific formula.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   Hexagonal numbers can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   H_n = 2n^2 - n
   \]
   where \( n \) is the position in the sequence. This formula gives us the nth hexagonal number directly. We will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer \( n \) as input and returns the nth hexagonal number.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `hexagonal_num` that takes an integer `n`.
   - Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula: `2 * n * n - n`.
   - Return the calculated hexagonal number.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def hexagonal_num(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula: 2n^2 - n
    hexagonal_number = 2 * n * n - n
    # Return the calculated hexagonal number
    return hexagonal_number
```

This function will correctly compute the nth hexagonal number using the given formula.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:

    1. **Formula Derivation**:
       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.

    2. **Handling the First Term**:
       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.

    3. **Efficiency**:
       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.

    4. **Code Simplicity**:
       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.

    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.
