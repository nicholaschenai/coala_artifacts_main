INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/63 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should find the maximum difference between the two integers in any of the tuples and return that maximum difference.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum difference found so far. Start with a value of zero.
2. Iterate over each tuple in the list.
3. For each tuple, calculate the absolute difference between the two integers.
4. If this difference is greater than the current maximum difference, update the maximum difference.
5. After checking all tuples, return the maximum difference found.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_difference(tuple_list):
    max_diff = 0
    for each tuple in tuple_list:
        calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers in the tuple
        if this difference is greater than max_diff:
            update max_diff with this difference
    return max_diff
```

## Python Solution

```python
def max_difference(tuple_list):
    # Initialize the maximum difference to zero
    max_diff = 0
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for a, b in tuple_list:
        # Calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers in the tuple
        diff = abs(a - b)
        
        # Update max_diff if the current difference is greater
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff
    
    # Return the maximum difference found
    return max_diff
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the challenge of finding the longest arithmetic subsequence in a list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is used to efficiently track and extend subsequences based on their differences. The key insight was to use a dictionary to store the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index with a specific difference. This allowed for quick updates and retrievals, making the solution efficient even for larger input sizes.

    The strategy involved iterating over each pair of indices `(i, j)` with `i < j`, calculating the difference `diff = A[j] - A[i]`, and updating the dictionary to reflect the longest subsequence ending at `j` with that difference. If a subsequence with the same difference already existed ending at `i`, it was extended; otherwise, a new subsequence was started.

    This approach worked well, and the solution passed all test cases. The use of a dictionary to map tuples of indices and differences to subsequence lengths was crucial in achieving an efficient solution. This problem reinforced the utility of dynamic programming in solving sequence-related problems and the importance of choosing the right data structures to manage state efficiently. 

    Here's the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def longestArithSeqLength(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
            dp = {}
            for j in range(1, len(A)):
                for i in range(j):
                    diff = A[j] - A[i]
                    if (i, diff) in dp:
                        dp[(j, diff)] = dp[(i, diff)] + 1
                    else:
                        dp[(j, diff)] = 2
            return max(dp.values())
    ```
