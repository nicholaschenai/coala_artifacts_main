The function should find the maximum difference between the two integers in any of the tuples and return that maximum difference.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum difference found so far. Start with a value of zero.\n2. Iterate over each tuple in the list.\n3. For each tuple, calculate the absolute difference between the two integers.\n4. If this difference is greater than the current maximum difference, update the maximum difference.\n5. After checking all tuples, return the maximum difference found.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_difference(tuple_list):\n    max_diff = 0\n    for each tuple in tuple_list:\n        calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers in the tuple\n        if this difference is greater than max_diff:\n            update max_diff with this difference\n    return max_diff\n```\n\n## Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_difference(tuple_list):\n    # Initialize the maximum difference to zero\n    max_diff = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for a, b in tuple_list:\n        # Calculate the absolute difference between the two numbers in the tuple\n        diff = abs(a - b)\n        \n        # Update max_diff if the current difference is greater\n        if diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = diff\n    \n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_diff\n```"

The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is used to efficiently track and extend subsequences based on their differences. The key insight was to use a dictionary to store the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index with a specific difference. This allowed for quick updates and retrievals, making the solution efficient even for larger input sizes.\n\n    The strategy involved iterating over each pair of indices `(i, j)` with `i < j`, calculating the difference `diff = A[j] - A[i]`, and updating the dictionary to reflect the longest subsequence ending at `j` with that difference. If a subsequence with the same difference already existed ending at `i`, it was extended; otherwise, a new subsequence was started.\n\n    This approach worked well, and the solution passed all test cases. The use of a dictionary to map tuples of indices and differences to subsequence lengths was crucial in achieving an efficient solution. This problem reinforced the utility of dynamic programming in solving sequence-related problems and the importance of choosing the right data structures to manage state efficiently. \n\n    Here's the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def longestArithSeqLength(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n            dp = {}\n            for j in range(1, len(A)):\n                for i in range(j):\n                    diff = A[j] - A[i]\n                    if (i, diff) in dp:\n                        dp[(j, diff)] = dp[(i, diff)] + 1\n                    else:\n                        dp[(j, diff)] = 2\n            return max(dp.values())\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
