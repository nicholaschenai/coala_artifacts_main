    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and moves all the numbers in the string to the end, while maintaining the order of both the letters and the numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string. We will separate the characters into two categories: letters and numbers. We will store letters in one list and numbers in another. After processing the entire string, we will concatenate the list of letters with the list of numbers to form the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function move_num(s):\n       Initialize an empty list for letters\n       Initialize an empty list for numbers\n\n       for each character in s:\n           if character is a digit:\n               Append character to the numbers list\n           else:\n               Append character to the letters list\n\n       Concatenate the letters list with the numbers list\n       Return the concatenated result as a string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef move_num(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize lists to hold letters and numbers separately\n    letters = []\n    numbers = []\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        if char.isdigit():\n            # If the character is a digit, add it to the numbers list\n            numbers.append(char)\n        else:\n            # If the character is a letter, add it to the letters list\n            letters.append(char)\n\n    # Concatenate the letters and numbers lists and convert to a string\n    return ''.join(letters) + ''.join(numbers)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently separates letters and numbers, maintaining their order, and then combines them to produce the desired output.",
