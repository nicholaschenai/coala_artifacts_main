INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/619 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a string as input and moves all the numeric characters to the end of the string, while maintaining the order of both the non-numeric and numeric characters.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Traverse the input string character by character.
2. Separate the characters into two groups: 
   - Non-numeric characters
   - Numeric characters
3. Concatenate the non-numeric characters first, followed by the numeric characters.
4. Return the resulting string.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize two empty strings: `non_numeric` and `numeric`.
2. For each character `char` in the input string:
   - If `char` is a digit, append it to the `numeric` string.
   - Otherwise, append it to the `non_numeric` string.
3. Concatenate `non_numeric` and `numeric` strings.
4. Return the concatenated string.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def move_num(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize empty strings for non-numeric and numeric characters
    non_numeric = ''
    numeric = ''
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is a digit
        if char.isdigit():
            # Append to numeric string if it is a digit
            numeric += char
        else:
            # Append to non-numeric string if it is not a digit
            non_numeric += char
    
    # Concatenate non-numeric and numeric strings
    result = non_numeric + numeric
    
    # Return the final result
    return result
```

This solution iterates over the input string once, separating characters into non-numeric and numeric categories, and then concatenates them in the required order.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


        The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


        You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

        Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


        Examples:

        s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
        s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
        s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a string that is encoded using a specific pattern. The pattern involves numbers followed by square brackets containing a substring. The number indicates how many times the substring inside the brackets should be repeated. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns and returning the fully decoded string.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the current state as we parse through the string. We will iterate over each character in the string:
           - If we encounter a digit, we will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.
           - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it indicates the start of a new encoded substring, so we push the current state (current string and repeat count) onto the stack.
           - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded substring. We pop the last state from the stack, repeat the substring the specified number of times, and append it to the previous string.
           - If we encounter a letter, we simply append it to the current string being built.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function decodeString(s):
               Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and repeat counts
               Initialize current_string as an empty string
               Initialize current_num as 0

               for each character in s:
                   if character is a digit:
                       Update current_num to include this digit
                   else if character is '[':
                       Push (current_string, current_num) onto the stack
                       Reset current_string to empty and current_num to 0
                   else if character is ']':
                       Pop (prev_string, repeat_count) from the stack
                       Update current_string to prev_string + (current_string repeated repeat_count times)
                   else:
                       Append character to current_string

               return current_string
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:

                stack = []
                current_string = ""
                current_num = 0

                # Iterate over each character in the input string
                for char in s:
                    if char.isdigit():
                        # If the character is a digit, update the current number
                        current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)
                    elif char == '[':
                        # If the character is '[', push the current state onto the stack
                        stack.append((current_string, current_num))
                        # Reset current_string and current_num for the new context
                        current_string = ""
                        current_num = 0
                    elif char == ']':
                        # If the character is ']', pop the last state from the stack
                        prev_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()
                        # Repeat the current_string and append it to the previous string
                        current_string = prev_string + current_string * repeat_count
                    else:
                        # If the character is a letter, append it to the current string
                        current_string += char

                # Return the fully decoded string
                return current_string
        ```

        This solution uses a stack to manage nested structures and handles multiple digits for repeat counts, ensuring the correct decoding of the input string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

       Concatenate the letters list with the numbers list
       Return the concatenated result as a string
