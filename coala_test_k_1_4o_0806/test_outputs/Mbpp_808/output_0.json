    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given integer `k` is present in a tuple of integers. The function should return `True` if `k` is found in the tuple, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the tuple and check if it matches the integer `k`. If we find a match, we return `True`. If we finish checking all elements without finding a match, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function check_K with parameters tuple_of_numbers and k\n       For each number in tuple_of_numbers\n           If number equals k\n               Return True\n       Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_K(tuple_of_numbers: tuple, k: int) -> bool:\n    # Iterate through each number in the tuple\n    for number in tuple_of_numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is equal to k\n        if number == k:\n            # If a match is found, return True\n            return True\n    # If no match is found after checking all numbers, return False\n    return False\n```",
