        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given integer `k` is present in a tuple of integers. The function should return `True` if `k` is found in the tuple, and `False` otherwise.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will define a function that takes two parameters: a tuple of integers and an integer `k`.\n   - We will use the `in` keyword in Python to check if `k` is present in the tuple.\n   - If `k` is found in the tuple, the function will return `True`.\n   - If `k` is not found in the tuple, the function will return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function check_K with parameters (tuple_of_integers, k)\n       If k is in tuple_of_integers\n           Return True\n       Else\n           Return False\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_K(tuple_of_integers, k):\n    # Check if k is present in the tuple_of_integers\n    if k in tuple_of_integers:\n        # If k is found, return True\n        return True\n    else:\n        # If k is not found, return False\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function uses the `in` keyword to determine if `k` is an element of the tuple, which is a straightforward and efficient way to perform this check in Python."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.\n    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.\n    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.\n    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n            prefix_sums = {0: 1}\n            current_sum = 0\n            count = 0\n        \n            for num in nums:\n                current_sum += num\n                needed_sum = current_sum - k\n                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]\n                if current_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1\n                else:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1\n        \n            return count\n    ```\n\n    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
