INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/126 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all common divisors of two given numbers. A common divisor is a number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Identify all divisors for each of the two numbers.
2. Find the common divisors between the two sets of divisors.
3. Sum up these common divisors.
4. Return the sum.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a helper function `find_divisors(n)` that returns a set of all divisors of `n`.
   - Initialize an empty set `divisors`.
   - Loop through numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - If `n` is divisible by the current number, add it to the `divisors` set.
   - Return the `divisors` set.

2. Define the main function `sum(a, b)`.
   - Use `find_divisors` to get the divisors of `a` and `b`.
   - Find the intersection of these two sets to get the common divisors.
   - Calculate the sum of the common divisors.
   - Return the sum.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_divisors(n: int) -> set:
    # Initialize an empty set to store divisors
    divisors = set()
    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # If i is a divisor of n, add it to the set
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
    return divisors

def sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Find divisors of both numbers
    divisors_a = find_divisors(a)
    divisors_b = find_divisors(b)
    # Find common divisors by intersecting the two sets
    common_divisors = divisors_a.intersection(divisors_b)
    # Calculate the sum of the common divisors
    return sum(common_divisors)
```

This code defines a helper function to find divisors and uses it to find and sum the common divisors of two numbers.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.
