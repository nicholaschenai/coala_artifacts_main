    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all common divisors of two given numbers. A common divisor is a number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the sum of common divisors of two numbers, we can:\n   - Determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. The common divisors of the two numbers are the divisors of their GCD.\n   - Find all divisors of the GCD.\n   - Sum these divisors to get the desired result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function sum(a, b):\n       Find the GCD of a and b\n       Initialize a variable total_sum to 0\n       For each number i from 1 to GCD:\n           If GCD is divisible by i:\n               Add i to total_sum\n       Return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef gcd(x, y):\n    # Helper function to calculate the greatest common divisor using Euclid's algorithm\n    while y != 0:\n        (x, y) = (y, x % y)\n    return x\n\ndef sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Find the greatest common divisor of a and b\n    common_gcd = gcd(a, b)\n    \n    # Initialize the sum of divisors\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to the GCD\n    for i in range(1, common_gcd + 1):\n        # If i is a divisor of the GCD, add it to the total sum\n        if common_gcd % i == 0:\n            total_sum += i\n    \n    # Return the sum of all common divisors\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the sum of common divisors by leveraging the properties of the greatest common divisor.",
