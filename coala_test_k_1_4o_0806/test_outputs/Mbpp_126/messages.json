A common divisor is a number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Identify all divisors for each of the two numbers.\n2. Find the common divisors between the two sets of divisors.\n3. Sum up these common divisors.\n4. Return the sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a helper function `find_divisors(n)` that returns a set of all divisors of `n`.\n   - Initialize an empty set `divisors`.\n   - Loop through numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).\n   - If `n` is divisible by the current number, add it to the `divisors` set.\n   - Return the `divisors` set.\n\n2. Define the main function `sum(a, b)`.\n   - Use `find_divisors` to get the divisors of `a` and `b`.\n   - Find the intersection of these two sets to get the common divisors.\n   - Calculate the sum of the common divisors.\n   - Return the sum.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors(n: int) -> set:\n    # Initialize an empty set to store divisors\n    divisors = set()\n    # Loop through all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # If i is a divisor of n, add it to the set\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n    return divisors\n\ndef sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Find divisors of both numbers\n    divisors_a = find_divisors(a)\n    divisors_b = find_divisors(b)\n    # Find common divisors by intersecting the two sets\n    common_divisors = divisors_a.intersection(divisors_b)\n    # Calculate the sum of the common divisors\n    return sum(common_divisors)\n```\n\nThis code defines a helper function to find divisors and uses it to find and sum the common divisors of two numbers."

The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.\n    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.\n    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countDivisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        i = 1\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n            i += 1\n        return count\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            A = int(data[index])\n            B = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            diff = abs(A - B)\n        \n            if diff == 0:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                results.append(countDivisors(diff))\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
