    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that finds all perfect square numbers between two given numbers, inclusive. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Iterate through all numbers starting from the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to the lower bound.\n   - Continue this iteration until the square of the integer exceeds the upper bound.\n   - For each integer, calculate its square and check if it lies within the given range.\n   - Collect all such perfect squares in a list and return the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function perfect_squares(a, b):\n       Initialize an empty list called squares\n       Initialize a variable n to 1\n       While n squared is less than or equal to b:\n           If n squared is greater than or equal to a:\n               Append n squared to squares\n           Increment n by 1\n       Return squares\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef perfect_squares(a: int, b: int) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store perfect squares\n    squares = []\n    \n    # Start with the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to a\n    n = 1\n    \n    # Continue until the square of n exceeds b\n    while n * n <= b:\n        # Calculate the square of n\n        square = n * n\n        \n        # If the square is within the range [a, b], add it to the list\n        if square >= a:\n            squares.append(square)\n        \n        # Move to the next integer\n        n += 1\n    \n    # Return the list of perfect squares\n    return squares\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find and return all perfect squares between the two given numbers, inclusive.",
