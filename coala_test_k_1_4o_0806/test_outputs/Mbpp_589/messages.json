        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that finds all perfect squares between two given numbers, inclusive. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25 are perfect squares because they are 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, and 5^2, respectively.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Range**: We are given two numbers, `start` and `end`. We need to find all perfect squares between these two numbers, inclusive.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Squares**: Start from the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to `start` and continue until the square of the integer is less than or equal to `end`.\n3. **Collect Perfect Squares**: For each integer in this range, calculate its square and add it to the list of perfect squares if it falls within the range `[start, end]`.\n4. **Return the List**: Return the list of perfect squares found.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction perfect_squares(start, end):\n    initialize an empty list called squares\n    initialize i to 1\n    while i * i is less than or equal to end:\n        if i * i is greater than or equal to start:\n            add i * i to squares\n        increment i by 1\n    return squares\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef perfect_squares(start: int, end: int) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store perfect squares\n    squares = []\n    \n    # Start with the smallest integer whose square is greater than or equal to start\n    i = 1\n    \n    # Continue while the square of i is within the range\n    while i * i <= end:\n        # Check if the square of i is within the range [start, end]\n        if i * i >= start:\n            # Add the square to the list\n            squares.append(i * i)\n        # Move to the next integer\n        i += 1\n    \n    # Return the list of perfect squares\n    return squares\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over integers starting from 1, checking if their squares fall within the specified range, and collects those that do. The loop stops when the square of the integer exceeds the `end` value."

The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:\n    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.\n    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.\n    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.\n    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n            subarray_sums = []\n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n            subarray_sums.sort()\n            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])\n            return result % (10**9 + 7)\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
