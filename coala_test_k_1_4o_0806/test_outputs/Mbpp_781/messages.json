The function should return `True` if the count of divisors is even, and `False` otherwise.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Divisors**: For a given integer `n`, a divisor is any integer `d` such that `n % d == 0`.\n2. **Count Divisors**: Iterate through all integers from 1 to `n` and count how many of them are divisors of `n`.\n3. **Check Evenness**: Determine if the count of divisors is even by checking if the count modulo 2 equals zero.\n4. **Return Result**: Return `True` if the count is even, otherwise return `False`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_divisors(n):\n    initialize count to 0\n    for each integer i from 1 to n:\n        if n is divisible by i:\n            increment count by 1\n    if count is even:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Initialize the count of divisors to 0\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # Increment the count of divisors\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Check if the count of divisors is even\n    return count % 2 == 0\n```\n\nThis function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, counts how many of them are divisors of `n`, and then checks if this count is even. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`."

The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.\n    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.\n    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countDivisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        i = 1\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n            i += 1\n        return count\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            A = int(data[index])\n            B = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            diff = abs(A - B)\n        \n            if diff == 0:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                results.append(countDivisors(diff))\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

It checks if the count of divisors is even and returns the appropriate boolean value."
