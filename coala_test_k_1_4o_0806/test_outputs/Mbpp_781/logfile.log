INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/781 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that checks if the number of divisors of a given integer is even. The function should return `True` if the count of divisors is even, and `False` otherwise.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Divisors**: For a given integer `n`, a divisor is any integer `d` such that `n % d == 0`.
2. **Count Divisors**: Iterate through all integers from 1 to `n` and count how many of them are divisors of `n`.
3. **Check Evenness**: Determine if the count of divisors is even by checking if the count modulo 2 equals zero.
4. **Return Result**: Return `True` if the count is even, otherwise return `False`.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_divisors(n):
    initialize count to 0
    for each integer i from 1 to n:
        if n is divisible by i:
            increment count by 1
    if count is even:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_divisors(n: int) -> bool:
    # Initialize the count of divisors to 0
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Check if i is a divisor of n
        if n % i == 0:
            # Increment the count of divisors
            count += 1
    
    # Check if the count of divisors is even
    return count % 2 == 0
```

This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, counts how many of them are divisors of `n`, and then checks if this count is even. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Also, here are some of your memories.
Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.
