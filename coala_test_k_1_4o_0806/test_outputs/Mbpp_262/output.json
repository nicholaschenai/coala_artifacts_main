    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer L as inputs. The function should split the list into two parts: the first part should contain the first L elements of the list, and the second part should contain the remaining elements. The function should return these two parts as a tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use list slicing in Python. We will slice the list into two parts: the first part will be from the start of the list to the L-th element (exclusive), and the second part will be from the L-th element to the end of the list. We will then return these two slices as a tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function split_two_parts with parameters lst (list) and L (integer)\n       Slice the list from the start to L and store it in first_part\n       Slice the list from L to the end and store it in second_part\n       Return a tuple containing first_part and second_part\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef split_two_parts(lst, L):\n    # Slice the list from the start to L to get the first part\n    first_part = lst[:L]\n    # Slice the list from L to the end to get the second part\n    second_part = lst[L:]\n    # Return the two parts as a tuple\n    return (first_part, second_part)\n```",
