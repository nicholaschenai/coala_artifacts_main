        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes a list and an integer `L`. The function should split the list into two parts: the first part should have a length of `L`, and the second part should contain the remaining elements. The function should return these two parts as a tuple.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We can use list slicing to achieve this. The first part of the list can be obtained by slicing from the start of the list to the `L`-th index. The second part can be obtained by slicing from the `L`-th index to the end of the list. We then return these two slices as a tuple.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `split_two_parts` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`.\n   - Slice the list from the start to `L` to get the first part.\n   - Slice the list from `L` to the end to get the second part.\n   - Return a tuple containing the first and second parts.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef split_two_parts(lst, L):\n    # Slice the list from the start to L to get the first part\n    first_part = lst[:L]\n    # Slice the list from L to the end to get the second part\n    second_part = lst[L:]\n    # Return a tuple containing the first and second parts\n    return (first_part, second_part)\n```\n\nThis solution uses list slicing to efficiently split the list into two parts and returns them as a tuple. The slicing operation is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in capabilities to handle list operations."

For each pair, it calculates a result using another function and stores the result in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result from the list.\n\n    [end of description]\n    This knowledge is useful in scenarios where one needs to compute a specific function over a range of integers, particularly when the function involves bitwise operations like XOR. The problem involves finding pairs of integers that satisfy certain conditions, which is a common task in combinatorial problems and cryptography. Understanding how to efficiently compute such functions over large ranges is crucial in competitive programming and algorithm design, especially when dealing with constraints that require optimization to handle large inputs within time limits. The solution also demonstrates how to handle multiple test cases efficiently, which is a common requirement in programming contests.\n\n\n    def compute_F(N):\n        for A in range(1, N + 1):\n            B = A ^ N\n            if A <= B <= N:\n                return B\n        return -1\n\n    def compute_G(L, R):\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(L, R + 1):\n            total += compute_F(i)\n        return total\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            L = int(data[index])\n            R = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n            result = compute_G(L, R)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for res in results:\n            print(res)\n\n    main()\n\n[/Reference Code (Not callable)]\n\n"
