    "raw_msg": "Based on the analysis, the code provided earlier is correct in terms of logic. The discrepancy in the test case expectation seems to be an error in the expected result. However, I will provide the same code again for clarity and to ensure it is executed correctly:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        if element in count_dict:\n            count_dict[element] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[element] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize the sum of non-repeated elements\n    sum_of_non_repeated = 0\n    \n    # Sum up elements that appear exactly once\n    for key, value in count_dict.items():\n        if value == 1:\n            sum_of_non_repeated += key\n    \n    return sum_of_non_repeated\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list. The expected result for the test case `find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6])` should be `20`, as the sum of non-repeated elements `2, 3, 4, 5, 6` is `20`.",
