    "raw_msg": "The code provided earlier is logically correct based on the problem statement, which is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. The discrepancy in the expected result of the test case seems to be an error in the test case setup. However, to ensure that the solution is correct, let's review the code and provide it again:\n\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        if element in count_dict:\n            count_dict[element] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[element] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize the sum of non-repeated elements\n    sum_of_non_repeated = 0\n    \n    # Sum up elements that appear exactly once\n    for key, value in count_dict.items():\n        if value == 1:\n            sum_of_non_repeated += key\n    \n    return sum_of_non_repeated\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the logic to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a list. The expected result for the test case `find_sum([1,2,3,1,1,4,5,6])` should be `20`, as the sum of non-repeated elements `2, 3, 4, 5, 6` is `20`. If the environment insists on `21`, there might be an error in the test case setup.",
