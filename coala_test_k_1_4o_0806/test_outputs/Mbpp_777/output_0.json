    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all elements that appear only once in the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - Create a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the list.\n   - Iterate through the list and update the dictionary with the count of each element.\n   - Initialize a variable to store the sum of non-repeated elements.\n   - Iterate through the dictionary, and for each element that appears exactly once, add it to the sum.\n   - Return the sum of these non-repeated elements.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_sum(lst):\n       create an empty dictionary called count_dict\n       for each element in lst:\n           if element is in count_dict:\n               increment its count\n           else:\n               set its count to 1\n       \n       initialize sum_of_non_repeated to 0\n       for each key, value in count_dict:\n           if value is 1:\n               add key to sum_of_non_repeated\n       \n       return sum_of_non_repeated\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_sum(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Count each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        if element in count_dict:\n            count_dict[element] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[element] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize the sum of non-repeated elements\n    sum_of_non_repeated = 0\n    \n    # Sum up elements that appear exactly once\n    for key, value in count_dict.items():\n        if value == 1:\n            sum_of_non_repeated += key\n    \n    return sum_of_non_repeated\n```\n\nThis code will correctly compute the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list.",
