The function should take a list of integers as input and return a new list with the integers sorted.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Shell Sort is an optimization of the Insertion Sort algorithm. It works by comparing elements that are a certain gap apart and sorting them. The gap is reduced gradually until it becomes 1, at which point the list is sorted using a standard Insertion Sort. The key idea is that by the time the gap is reduced to 1, the list is already partially sorted, which makes the final insertion sort pass more efficient.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function shell_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       gap = n // 2\n       while gap > 0:\n           for i from gap to n-1:\n               temp = arr[i]\n               j = i\n               while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                   arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                   j = j - gap\n               arr[j] = temp\n           gap = gap // 2\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef shell_sort(arr):\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Initialize the gap size\n    gap = n // 2\n    \n    # Continue the process until the gap is reduced to 0\n    while gap > 0:\n        # Perform a gapped insertion sort for this gap size\n        for i in range(gap, n):\n            # Store the current element in a temporary variable\n            temp = arr[i]\n            # Initialize j to the current index\n            j = i\n            # Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found\n            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                j -= gap\n            # Place the temp element at its correct position\n            arr[j] = temp\n        # Reduce the gap for the next iteration\n        gap //= 2\n    \n    # Return the sorted array\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the Shell Sort algorithm as described, sorting the input list in ascending order."

An inversion is defined as a pair of indices \\(i, j\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(arr[i] > arr[j]\\). The challenge was to implement an efficient solution that could handle large arrays, given the constraints.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns\n\n    The problem tests the understanding of inversion counting using a modified merge sort algorithm. This approach leverages the divide-and-conquer strategy to count inversions in \\(O(N \\log N)\\) time, which is efficient for large inputs. The key insight is that during the merge step, if an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, it indicates inversions equal to the number of remaining elements in the left subarray.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes\n\n    Initially, the solution logic was correct, but the script failed to produce output because the `main()` function was not called. This was a simple oversight that was fixed by adding a conditional check to call `main()` when the script is executed directly. This is a common practice in Python to ensure that the script's main logic is executed only when it is run as the main program.\n\n    ### Code Snippet\n\n    Here's the key part of the solution that counts inversions using merge sort:\n\n    ```python\n    def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):\n        # Merging and counting inversions\n        # ...\n\n    def merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):\n        # Recursive merge sort and inversion counting\n        # ...\n\n    def count_inversions(arr):\n        # Initialize and call merge_sort_and_count\n        # ...\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that the main function is executed in scripts that rely on standard input/output, especially in competitive programming and testing environments.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The function should return the sorted list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Shell sort is an in-place comparison sort that generalizes insertion sort by allowing the exchange of items that are far apart. The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. The process continues until the gap is 1, at which point it becomes a simple insertion sort. The choice of gap sequence can affect the performance of the algorithm.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function shell_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       gap = n // 2\n       while gap > 0:\n           for i from gap to n-1:\n               temp = arr[i]\n               j = i\n               while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                   arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                   j = j - gap\n               arr[j] = temp\n           gap = gap // 2\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef shell_sort(arr):\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Initialize the gap size\n    gap = n // 2\n    \n    # Continue the process until the gap is reduced to 0\n    while gap > 0:\n        # Perform a gapped insertion sort for this gap size\n        for i in range(gap, n):\n            # Store the current element in a temporary variable\n            temp = arr[i]\n            # Initialize j to the current index\n            j = i\n            # Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found\n            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                j -= gap\n            # Place the temp element at its correct position\n            arr[j] = temp\n        # Reduce the gap for the next iteration\n        gap //= 2\n    \n    # Return the sorted array\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the Shell sort algorithm, which sorts the array by progressively reducing the gap between compared elements and performing insertion sort on these elements.
