    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to implement a function that sorts a given list of numbers using the Shell sort algorithm. The function should return the sorted list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Shell sort is an in-place comparison sort that generalizes insertion sort by allowing the exchange of items that are far apart. The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. The process continues until the gap is 1, at which point it becomes a simple insertion sort. The choice of gap sequence can affect the performance of the algorithm.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function shell_sort(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       gap = n // 2\n       while gap > 0:\n           for i from gap to n-1:\n               temp = arr[i]\n               j = i\n               while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                   arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                   j = j - gap\n               arr[j] = temp\n           gap = gap // 2\n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef shell_sort(arr):\n    # Get the length of the array\n    n = len(arr)\n    # Initialize the gap size\n    gap = n // 2\n    \n    # Continue the process until the gap is reduced to 0\n    while gap > 0:\n        # Perform a gapped insertion sort for this gap size\n        for i in range(gap, n):\n            # Store the current element in a temporary variable\n            temp = arr[i]\n            # Initialize j to the current index\n            j = i\n            # Shift earlier gap-sorted elements up until the correct location for arr[i] is found\n            while j >= gap and arr[j - gap] > temp:\n                arr[j] = arr[j - gap]\n                j -= gap\n            # Place the temp element at its correct position\n            arr[j] = temp\n        # Reduce the gap for the next iteration\n        gap //= 2\n    \n    # Return the sorted array\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the Shell sort algorithm, which sorts the array by progressively reducing the gap between compared elements and performing insertion sort on these elements. The process continues until the gap is reduced to 1, at which point the array is fully sorted.",
