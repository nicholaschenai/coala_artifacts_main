### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the first character that appears more than once in the string. If there are no repeated characters, the function should return `None`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through each character in the string.
2. We will keep track of characters we have already seen using a set.
3. As we iterate, we will check if the current character is already in the set:
   - If it is, this character is the first repeated character, and we return it.
   - If it is not, we add the character to the set and continue.
4. If we finish iterating through the string without finding a repeated character, we return `None`.

### Pseudocode

```
function first_repeated_char(s):
    create an empty set called seen_chars
    for each character c in string s:
        if c is in seen_chars:
            return c
        else:
            add c to seen_chars
    return None
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def first_repeated_char(s: str) -> str:
    # Create an empty set to keep track of seen characters
    seen_chars = set()
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for c in s:
        # Check if the character is already in the set
        if c in seen_chars:
            # If it is, return this character as it is the first repeated one
            return c
        else:
            # If not, add the character to the set
            seen_chars.add(c)
    
    # If no repeated character is found, return None
    return None
```

    [Task]:
        Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
        We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
        Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
        It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
        Example 1:
        Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
        Output: "abcd"
        Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
        Example 2:
        Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
        Output: "aa"
        Explanation: 
        First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
        Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
        Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
        Example 3:
        Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
        Output: "ps"

Â 
        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 10^5
        2 <= k <= 10^4
        s only contains lower case English letters.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string. For each character in the string:
           - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.
           - If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack.
           - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.
           - Finally, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function removeDuplicates(s, k):
               Initialize an empty stack
       
               for each character in s:
                   if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:
                       Increment the count of the top element in the stack
                       if count equals k:
                           Pop the top element from the stack
                   else:
                       Push (character, 1) onto the stack
       
               Initialize result as an empty string
               for each (character, count) in stack:
                   Append character repeated count times to result
       
               return result
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
                # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts
                stack = []
        
                # Iterate over each character in the string
                for char in s:
                    if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                        # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character
                        stack[-1][1] += 1  # Increment the count of the top element
                        if stack[-1][1] == k:
                            # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack
                            stack.pop()
                    else:
                        # If the stack is empty or the top character is different, push the current character with count 1
                        stack.append([char, 1])
        
                # Reconstruct the result string from the stack
                result = ''
                for char, count in stack:
                    result += char * count  # Append the character repeated 'count' times
        
                return result
        ```

        This solution efficiently manages the removal of `k` adjacent duplicates using a stack, ensuring that the operations are performed in linear time relative to the length of the string.

   We need to find the first character in a given string that appears more than once. The function should return this character as soon as it is found.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string while keeping track of the characters we have already seen. We can use a set to store these characters. As we iterate through the string, if we encounter a character that is already in the set, it means this character is repeated, and we can return it immediately. If the character is not in the set, we add it to the set and continue.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function first_repeated_char(s):
       Initialize an empty set called seen_chars
       
       for each character in s:
           if character is in seen_chars:
               return character
           else:
               add character to seen_chars

   ```
