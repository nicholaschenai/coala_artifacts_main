    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the first character in a given string that appears more than once. The function should return this character as soon as it is found.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string while keeping track of the characters we have already seen. We can use a set to store these characters. As we iterate through the string, if we encounter a character that is already in the set, it means this character is repeated, and we can return it immediately. If the character is not in the set, we add it to the set and continue.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function first_repeated_char(s):\n       Initialize an empty set called seen_chars\n       \n       for each character in s:\n           if character is in seen_chars:\n               return character\n           else:\n               add character to seen_chars\n       \n       return None  # In case there is no repeated character\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef first_repeated_char(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty set to keep track of seen characters\n    seen_chars = set()\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # If the character is already in the set, it is the first repeated character\n        if char in seen_chars:\n            return char\n        # Otherwise, add the character to the set\n        seen_chars.add(char)\n    \n    # If no repeated character is found, return None\n    return None\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the first repeated character by using a set to track characters that have been seen, ensuring that the operation is performed in linear time relative to the length of the string.",
