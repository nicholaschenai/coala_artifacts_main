    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a dictionary of students with their heights and weights, and two minimum values for height and weight. The function should return a new dictionary containing only those students whose height and weight are both greater than the given minimum values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Iterate over each student in the dictionary.\n   - For each student, check if their height is greater than the minimum height and their weight is greater than the minimum weight.\n   - If both conditions are met, add the student to a new dictionary.\n   - Return the new dictionary containing only the students who meet the criteria.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function filter_data with parameters: students_dict, min_height, min_weight\n       Initialize an empty dictionary called filtered_students\n       For each student_name, (height, weight) in students_dict\n           If height is greater than min_height and weight is greater than min_weight\n               Add student_name and (height, weight) to filtered_students\n       Return filtered_students\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef filter_data(students_dict: dict, min_height: float, min_weight: float) -> dict:\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store students who meet the criteria\n    filtered_students = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each student in the input dictionary\n    for student_name, (height, weight) in students_dict.items():\n        # Check if both height and weight are above the minimum thresholds\n        if height > min_height and weight > min_weight:\n            # Add the student to the filtered dictionary\n            filtered_students[student_name] = (height, weight)\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing only the students who meet the criteria\n    return filtered_students\n```",
