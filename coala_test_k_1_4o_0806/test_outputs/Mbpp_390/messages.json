The function should apply the format string to each element in the list and return a new list with the formatted strings. The format string will contain a placeholder `{0}` that should be replaced by each element from the list.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Iterate through the list**: For each element in the list, we need to apply the format string.\n2. **Format each element**: Use the format string to create a new string where the placeholder `{0}` is replaced by the current element.\n3. **Collect results**: Store each formatted string in a new list.\n4. **Return the new list**: Once all elements have been formatted, return the list of formatted strings.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction add_string(elements, format_string):\n    create an empty list called formatted_list\n    for each element in elements:\n        formatted_element = format_string with element replacing {0}\n        append formatted_element to formatted_list\n    return formatted_list\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef add_string(elements, format_string):\n    # Create an empty list to store the formatted strings\n    formatted_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in elements:\n        # Format the current element using the format string\n        formatted_element = format_string.format(element)\n        \n        # Append the formatted string to the result list\n        formatted_list.append(formatted_element)\n    \n    # Return the list of formatted strings\n    return formatted_list\n```"

The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.\n\n    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.\n\n    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\n    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:\n    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.\n    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.\n    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The function should apply the format string to each element in the list and return a new list with the formatted strings.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate over each element in the input list. For each element, we will apply the given format string using Python's string formatting capabilities. Specifically, we will use the `str.format()` method to insert each element into the format string. The result will be a new list containing all the formatted strings.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function add_string with parameters: elements (list) and format_str (string)\n       Initialize an empty list called formatted_list\n       For each element in elements:\n           Format the element using format_str and append the result to formatted_list\n       Return formatted_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef add_string(elements, format_str):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the formatted strings\n    formatted_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in elements:\n        # Apply the format string to the current element and append to the formatted list\n        formatted_list.append(format_str.format(element))\n    \n    # Return the list of formatted strings\n    return formatted_list\n```"
