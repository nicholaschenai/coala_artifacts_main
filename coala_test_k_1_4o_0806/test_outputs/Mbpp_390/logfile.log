## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function called `add_string` that takes two inputs: a list of elements and a format string. The function should apply the format string to each element in the list and return a new list with the formatted strings. The format string will contain a placeholder `{0}` that should be replaced by each element from the list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Iterate through the list**: For each element in the list, we need to apply the format string.
2. **Format each element**: Use the format string to create a new string where the placeholder `{0}` is replaced by the current element.
3. **Collect results**: Store each formatted string in a new list.
4. **Return the new list**: Once all elements have been formatted, return the list of formatted strings.

## Pseudocode

```
function add_string(elements, format_string):
    create an empty list called formatted_list
    for each element in elements:
        formatted_element = format_string with element replacing {0}
        append formatted_element to formatted_list
    return formatted_list
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def add_string(elements, format_string):
    # Create an empty list to store the formatted strings
    formatted_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each element in the input list
    for element in elements:
        # Format the current element using the format string
        formatted_element = format_string.format(element)
        
        # Append the formatted string to the result list
        formatted_list.append(formatted_element)
    
    # Return the list of formatted strings
    return formatted_list
```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this pattern generation task, I encountered a few key insights:

    1. **Pattern Understanding**: The main challenge was correctly understanding the pattern generation logic. The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.

    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.

    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.

    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:
    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.
    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.
    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. 

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.

   We need to create a function that takes a list of elements and a format string. The function should apply the format string to each element in the list and return a new list with the formatted strings.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will iterate over each element in the input list. For each element, we will apply the given format string using Python's string formatting capabilities.
