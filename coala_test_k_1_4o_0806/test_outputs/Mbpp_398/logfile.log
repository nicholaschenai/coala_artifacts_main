INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/398 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all the digits of each number in the list. For example, given the list `[10, 2, 56]`, the function should return `14` because the sum of the digits is `1 + 0 + 2 + 5 + 6 = 14`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum of digits.
2. Iterate over each number in the list.
3. For each number, convert it to a string to easily access each digit.
4. Convert each character (digit) back to an integer and add it to the total sum.
5. After processing all numbers, return the total sum.

## Pseudocode

```
function sum_of_digits(numbers):
    total_sum = 0
    for each number in numbers:
        convert number to string
        for each character in string:
            convert character to integer
            add integer to total_sum
    return total_sum
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_of_digits(numbers):
    # Initialize the total sum of digits to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Convert the number to a string to access each digit
        str_number = str(number)
        
        # Iterate over each character in the string representation of the number
        for char in str_number:
            # Convert the character back to an integer
            digit = int(char)
            
            # Add the digit to the total sum
            total_sum += digit
    
    # Return the total sum of all digits
    return total_sum
```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem of evaluating a simple mathematical expression string was straightforward, and my initial approach closely aligned with the official solution. Both solutions utilized a stack to handle parentheses and maintain the correct order of operations, and both iterated through the string character by character to build numbers and apply operations.

    Key insights from the official solution:
    - The use of `ord(c) - ord('0')` to convert a character to its integer value is a neat trick that avoids using `int(c)`. This is a minor optimization but can be useful in environments where performance is critical.
    - The official solution resets the `sign` to `1` after processing a closing parenthesis, which is a good practice to ensure that the sign is correctly initialized for any subsequent operations.
    - The final check `if num:` before adding the last number to the result ensures that any remaining number is added to the result, which is a good safeguard against missing the last number in the expression.

    Overall, the problem was a good exercise in using stacks to manage nested operations and ensuring that all parts of the expression are evaluated correctly. The official solution confirmed the effectiveness of the stack-based approach and provided a few minor optimizations that could be useful in similar problems.
