    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle when given the lengths of the other two sides. The function should return the length of the third side as a floating-point number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   In a right-angled triangle, the relationship between the sides is given by the Pythagorean theorem: \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\), where \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse. If we are given two sides, we can determine if one of them is the hypotenuse by comparing their lengths. If one side is longer, it is the hypotenuse. We then use the Pythagorean theorem to solve for the third side. If neither side is longer, we assume both are the legs of the triangle and solve for the hypotenuse.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function otherside_rightangle(side1, side2):\n       if side1 > side2:\n           hypotenuse = side1\n           leg = side2\n           third_side = sqrt(hypotenuse^2 - leg^2)\n       else:\n           hypotenuse = side2\n           leg = side1\n           third_side = sqrt(hypotenuse^2 - leg^2)\n       return third_side\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef otherside_rightangle(side1: float, side2: float) -> float:\n    # Determine which side is the hypotenuse\n    if side1 > side2:\n        hypotenuse = side1\n        leg = side2\n    else:\n        hypotenuse = side2\n        leg = side1\n    \n    # Calculate the third side using the Pythagorean theorem\n    third_side = (hypotenuse**2 - leg**2) ** 0.5\n    \n    # Return the length of the third side\n    return third_side\n```\n\nThis function calculates the third side of a right-angled triangle by identifying the hypotenuse and using the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side.",
