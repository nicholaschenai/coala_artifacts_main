    "raw_msg": "Let's fix the solution based on the insights we gathered. The problem requires us to find the third side of a right-angled triangle given two sides. The test case suggests that both given sides are legs, and we need to calculate the hypotenuse.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef otherside_rightangle(side1: float, side2: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the hypotenuse if both sides are legs\n    hypotenuse = (side1**2 + side2**2) ** 0.5\n    \n    # Return the length of the hypotenuse\n    return hypotenuse\n```\n\nThis code assumes that both given sides are the legs of the triangle and calculates the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem. This approach aligns with the test case provided, where the expected result is the hypotenuse of a triangle with legs of length 7 and 8.",
