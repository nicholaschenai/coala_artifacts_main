        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the length of the third side of a right-angled triangle when given the lengths of the other two sides. The function should return the length of the third side as a floating-point number.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. In a right-angled triangle, the relationship between the sides is given by the Pythagorean theorem: \\( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\), where \\( c \\) is the hypotenuse (the longest side), and \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the other two sides.\n2. Given two sides, we need to determine if one of them is the hypotenuse or if we need to calculate the hypotenuse.\n3. If one side is the hypotenuse, we can find the other side using the formula: \\( \\text{other side} = \\sqrt{c^2 - a^2} \\).\n4. If neither side is the hypotenuse, we calculate the hypotenuse using: \\( c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `otherside_rightangle(a, b)`.\n2. Determine which side is the hypotenuse by comparing `a` and `b`.\n3. If `a` is greater than `b`, assume `a` is the hypotenuse:\n   - Calculate the other side using the formula: \\( \\text{other side} = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} \\).\n4. If `b` is greater than `a`, assume `b` is the hypotenuse:\n   - Calculate the other side using the formula: \\( \\text{other side} = \\sqrt{b^2 - a^2} \\).\n5. If `a` and `b` are equal, calculate the hypotenuse using: \\( c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\).\n6. Return the calculated side.\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef otherside_rightangle(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n    # Determine which side is the hypotenuse\n    if a > b:\n        # a is the hypotenuse, calculate the other side\n        return (a**2 - b**2) ** 0.5\n    elif b > a:\n        # b is the hypotenuse, calculate the other side\n        return (b**2 - a**2) ** 0.5\n    else:\n        # a and b are equal, calculate the hypotenuse\n        return (a**2 + b**2) ** 0.5\n```\n\nThis code will correctly calculate the third side of a right-angled triangle given two sides, using the Pythagorean theorem."
