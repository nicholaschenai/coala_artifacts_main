A number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.\n3. If the number is even, add it to a new list.\n4.

The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\n    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.\n\n    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. \n\n    Here is the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            steps = 0\n            while n != 1:\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    n //= 2\n                else:\n                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                        n -= 1\n                    else:\n                        n += 1\n                steps += 1\n            return steps\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
