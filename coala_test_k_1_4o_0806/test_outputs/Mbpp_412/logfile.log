INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/412 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. Odd numbers should be removed.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate through each number in the input list.
2. Check if the number is even. A number is even if it is divisible by 2 with no remainder.
3. If the number is even, add it to a new list.
4. Return the new list containing only even numbers.

### Pseudocode

```
function remove_odd(numbers):
    create an empty list called even_numbers
    for each number in numbers:
        if number is even (number % 2 == 0):
            append number to even_numbers
    return even_numbers
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def remove_odd(numbers):
    # Create an empty list to store even numbers
    even_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the number is even
        if number % 2 == 0:
            # If even, add it to the even_numbers list
            even_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the list of even numbers
    return even_numbers
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.

    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.

    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. 

    Here is the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
            steps = 0
            while n != 1:
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    n //= 2
                else:
                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        n += 1
                steps += 1
            return steps
    ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/412 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with all the odd numbers removed.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the given list. For each number, we will check if it is even. If it is even, we will include it in a new list. If it is odd, we will skip it. Finally, we will return the new list containing only the even numbers.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function called remove_odd that takes a list of integers as input.
   Initialize an empty list called even_numbers.
   For each number in the input list:
       If the number is even (i.e., number % 2 == 0):
           Append the number to the even_numbers list.
   Return the even_numbers list.
