The original problem statement did not specify that spaces should be removed from the tuple. However, if the requirement is to exclude spaces, we can adjust the function accordingly. Here is the modified solution that excludes spaces from the tuple:\n\n```python\ndef string_to_tuple(s: str) -> tuple:\n    # Convert the string s into a tuple, excluding spaces\n    result = tuple(char for char in s if char != ' ')\n    # Return the resulting tuple\n    return result\n```\n\nThis version of the function will create a tuple of characters from the input string, excluding any spaces. If the original problem statement intended to include spaces, the initial implementation was correct.",
