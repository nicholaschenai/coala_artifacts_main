    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and converts it into a tuple where each character of the string becomes an individual element of the tuple.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To convert a string into a tuple of characters, we can iterate over each character in the string and collect them into a tuple. In Python, we can directly convert a string to a tuple using the `tuple()` function, which will automatically create a tuple with each character of the string as an element.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function string_to_tuple(s):\n       Convert the string s into a tuple using the tuple() function\n       Return the resulting tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef string_to_tuple(s: str) -> tuple:\n    # Convert the string s into a tuple where each character is an element\n    result = tuple(s)\n    # Return the resulting tuple\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the input string into a tuple of characters, which is a straightforward and efficient approach.",
