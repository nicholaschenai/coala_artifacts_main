INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/559 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the sum of the largest contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. A contiguous sublist is a sequence of elements that appear consecutively in the list. The task is to identify the sublist with the maximum sum and return that sum.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use Kadane's Algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize two variables: `max_so_far` to store the maximum sum found so far, and `max_ending_here` to store the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position.
2. Iterate through each element in the list:
   - Update `max_ending_here` by adding the current element to it.
   - If `max_ending_here` is greater than `max_so_far`, update `max_so_far`.
   - If `max_ending_here` becomes negative, reset it to zero, as a negative sum would not contribute to a maximum sum in future subarrays.
3. After iterating through the list, `max_so_far` will contain the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_sub_array_sum(arr, n):
    max_so_far = -infinity
    max_ending_here = 0

    for each element in arr:
        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + element
        if max_so_far < max_ending_here:
            max_so_far = max_ending_here
        if max_ending_here < 0:
            max_ending_here = 0

    return max_so_far
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def max_sub_array_sum(arr: list, n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the maximum sum so far to a very small number
    max_so_far = float('-inf')
    # Initialize the maximum sum ending at the current position to 0
    max_ending_here = 0

    # Iterate over each element in the array
    for i in range(n):
        # Update the maximum sum ending here by adding the current element
        max_ending_here += arr[i]
        
        # Update the maximum sum so far if the current max ending here is greater
        if max_so_far < max_ending_here:
            max_so_far = max_ending_here
        
        # If the current max ending here is negative, reset it to 0
        if max_ending_here < 0:
            max_ending_here = 0

    # Return the maximum sum found
    return max_so_far
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to compute the sums of all non-empty continuous subarrays of a given array, sort these sums, and then calculate the sum of a specified range of these sorted sums. The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.
    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.
    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.
    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
            subarray_sums = []
            for start in range(n):
                current_sum = 0
                for end in range(start, n):
                    current_sum += nums[end]
                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
            subarray_sums.sort()
            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])
            return result % (10**9 + 7)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.

   We need to find the sum of the largest contiguous sublist (subarray) within a given list of integers. A contiguous sublist is a sequence of elements that are consecutive in the list. The task is to identify the sublist with the maximum sum and return that sum.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use Kadane's Algorithm, which efficiently finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. The algorithm works by iterating through the list while maintaining two variables: one for the maximum sum found so far and another for the current sum of the subarray being considered. As we iterate, we update the current sum by adding the current element. If the current sum becomes negative, we reset it to zero because a negative sum would decrease the sum of any subsequent subarray. We also update the maximum sum whenever the current sum exceeds it.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize max_sum to negative infinity
   Initialize current_sum to 0

   For each element in the list:
       Add the element to current_sum
       If current_sum is greater than max_sum:
           Update max_sum to current_sum
       If current_sum is less than 0:
           Reset current_sum to 0
