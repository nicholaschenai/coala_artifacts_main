    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and a number. We need to find the name associated with the smallest number in these tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start by assuming the first tuple has the smallest number.\n   - Go through each tuple in the list.\n   - If a tuple has a smaller number than the current smallest, update the smallest number and the associated name.\n   - After checking all tuples, return the name associated with the smallest number.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function index_minimum(list_of_tuples):\n       if list_of_tuples is empty:\n           return None\n       \n       set min_value to the second element of the first tuple\n       set min_name to the first element of the first tuple\n       \n       for each tuple in list_of_tuples:\n           if the second element of the tuple is less than min_value:\n               update min_value to the second element of the tuple\n               update min_name to the first element of the tuple\n       \n       return min_name\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef index_minimum(list_of_tuples):\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not list_of_tuples:\n        return None\n    \n    # Initialize min_value and min_name with the first tuple's values\n    min_value = list_of_tuples[0][1]\n    min_name = list_of_tuples[0][0]\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for name, value in list_of_tuples:\n        # If the current tuple's value is smaller than min_value, update min_value and min_name\n        if value < min_value:\n            min_value = value\n            min_name = name\n    \n    # Return the name associated with the smallest value\n    return min_name\n```",
