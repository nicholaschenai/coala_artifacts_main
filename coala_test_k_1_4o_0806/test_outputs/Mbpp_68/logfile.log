INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/68 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given list of numbers is monotonic. A list is considered monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. In other words, the list should either be sorted in ascending order or descending order, or remain constant.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Monotonicity**: 
   - A list is non-decreasing if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
   - A list is non-increasing if each element is greater than or equal to the next element.
   
2. **Check Both Conditions**:
   - We will check if the list is non-decreasing.
   - We will also check if the list is non-increasing.
   - If either condition is true, the list is monotonic.

3. **Return Result**:
   - If the list satisfies either the non-decreasing or non-increasing condition, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_Monotonic(array):
    if array is empty or has one element:
        return True
    
    initialize two flags: is_non_decreasing and is_non_increasing to True
    
    for each index i from 0 to length of array - 2:
        if array[i] > array[i + 1]:
            set is_non_decreasing to False
        if array[i] < array[i + 1]:
            set is_non_increasing to False
    
    return is_non_decreasing or is_non_increasing
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_Monotonic(array):
    # An empty array or a single-element array is trivially monotonic
    if len(array) <= 1:
        return True
    
    # Initialize flags for non-decreasing and non-increasing
    is_non_decreasing = True
    is_non_increasing = True
    
    # Iterate through the array to check monotonicity
    for i in range(len(array) - 1):
        if array[i] > array[i + 1]:
            is_non_decreasing = False
        if array[i] < array[i + 1]:
            is_non_increasing = False
    
    # The array is monotonic if it is either non-decreasing or non-increasing
    return is_non_decreasing or is_non_increasing
```

This solution efficiently checks the monotonicity of the array by iterating through it once, making it O(n) in time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.

   We need to determine if a given list of numbers is monotonic. A list is considered monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To check if a list is monotonic, we can iterate through the list and check two conditions:
   - If the list is non-decreasing: Each element should be less than or equal to the next element.
   - If the list is non-increasing: Each element should be greater than or equal to the next element.
   
   If either of these conditions holds true for the entire list, then the list is monotonic.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function is_Monotonic(arr):
       Initialize two boolean variables, is_non_decreasing and is_non_increasing, to True
       
       Loop through the list from the first element to the second last element:
           If the current element is greater than the next element:
               Set is_non_decreasing to False
           If the current element is less than the next element:
