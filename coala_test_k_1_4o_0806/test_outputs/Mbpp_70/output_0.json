    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if all the tuples in a given list have the same length. If all tuples have the same length, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, check if the list of tuples is empty. If it is, return `True` because there are no tuples to compare.\n   - If the list is not empty, get the length of the first tuple.\n   - Iterate through the rest of the tuples in the list and compare their lengths to the length of the first tuple.\n   - If any tuple has a different length, return `False`.\n   - If all tuples have the same length, return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function get_equal(tuples):\n       if tuples is empty:\n           return True\n       set first_length to length of the first tuple\n       for each tuple in tuples:\n           if length of tuple is not equal to first_length:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef get_equal(tuples):\n    # If the list of tuples is empty, return True\n    if not tuples:\n        return True\n    \n    # Get the length of the first tuple\n    first_length = len(tuples[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through each tuple in the list\n    for t in tuples:\n        # If the current tuple's length is not equal to the first tuple's length, return False\n        if len(t) != first_length:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all tuples have the same length, return True\n    return True\n```",
