INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/70 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if all the tuples in a given list have the same length. If all tuples have the same length, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Extract Lengths**: First, we will extract the length of each tuple in the list.
2. **Check Uniformity**: We will then check if all these lengths are the same.
3. **Return Result**: If all lengths are equal, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `get_equal` that takes a list of tuples as input.
2. If the list is empty, return `True` because there are no tuples to compare.
3. Extract the length of the first tuple and store it in a variable `first_length`.
4. Iterate over each tuple in the list:
   - If the length of the current tuple is not equal to `first_length`, return `False`.
5. If the loop completes without returning `False`, return `True`.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def get_equal(tuples: list) -> bool:
    # If the list is empty, all tuples (none) have the same length by default
    if not tuples:
        return True
    
    # Get the length of the first tuple
    first_length = len(tuples[0])
    
    # Check if all tuples have the same length as the first one
    for t in tuples:
        if len(t) != first_length:
            return False
    
    # If all tuples have the same length, return True
    return True
```

This solution iterates through the list of tuples, comparing each tuple's length to the first tuple's length. If any tuple has a different length, it returns `False`. If all tuples have the same length, it returns `True`.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.
