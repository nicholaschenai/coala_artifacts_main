INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/612 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. The function should return a new list containing two lists: the first list should contain all the first elements from each sublist, and the second list should contain all the second elements from each sublist.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize two empty lists: one for storing the first elements of each sublist and another for storing the second elements.
2. Iterate over each sublist in the input list.
3. For each sublist, append the first element to the first list and the second element to the second list.
4. After processing all sublists, return a list containing the two lists.

## Pseudocode

```
function merge(list_of_lists):
    initialize first_elements as an empty list
    initialize second_elements as an empty list
    
    for each sublist in list_of_lists:
        append the first element of sublist to first_elements
        append the second element of sublist to second_elements
    
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def merge(list_of_lists):
    # Initialize two empty lists to store the first and second elements
    first_elements = []
    second_elements = []
    
    # Iterate over each sublist in the input list
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Append the first element of the sublist to first_elements
        first_elements.append(sublist[0])
        # Append the second element of the sublist to second_elements
        second_elements.append(sublist[1])
    
    # Return a list containing the two lists
    return [first_elements, second_elements]

        This is the harder version of Unflatten a list (Easy)

        So you have again to build a method, that creates new arrays, that can be flattened!

        # Shorter: You have to unflatten a list/an array.

        You get an array of integers and have to unflatten it by these rules:
        ```
        - You have to do several runs. The depth is the number of runs, you have to do.
        - In every run you have to switch the direction. First run from left, next run from right. Next left...
        Every run has these rules:
        - You start at the first number (from the direction).
        - Take for every number x the remainder of the division by the number of still available elements (from 
          this position!) to have the number for the next decision.
        - If the remainder-value is smaller than 3, take this number x (NOT the remainder-Value) direct
          for the new array and continue with the next number.
        - If the remainder-value (e.g. 3) is greater than 2, take the next remainder-value-number (e.g. 3)
          elements/numbers (inclusive the number x, NOT the remainder-value) as a sub-array in the new array.
          Continue with the next number/element AFTER this taken elements/numbers.
        - Every sub-array in the array is independent and is only one element for the progress on the array. 
          For every sub-array you have to follow the same rules for unflatten it.
          The direction is always the same as the actual run.
        ```

        Sounds complicated? Yeah, thats why, this is the harder version...
        Maybe an example will help.

        ```
         Array: [4, 5, 1, 7, 1] Depth: 2 -> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]
 
        Steps: 
        First run: (start from left side!)
        1. The first number is 4. The number is smaller than the number of remaining elements, so it is the remainder-value (4 / 5 -> remainder 4).
           So 4 numbers (4, 5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the new array.
        2. The next number is 1. It is smaller than 3, so the 1 is added direct to the new array.
        Now we have --> [[4, 5, 1, 7], 1]

        Second run: (start from right side!)
        1. The last number (first from other side) is 1. So the 1 is added direct to the new array.
        2. The next element is the sub-array. So we use the rules for this.
        2a.The last number is 7. There are 4 elements in the array. So for the next decision you have to
           take the remainder from 7 / 4 -> 3. So 3 numbers (5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the 
           new array.
        2b.Now there is the 4 and only one element last in this array. 4 / 1 -> remainder 0. It is smaller
           than 3. So the 4 is added direct to the new array.
        Now we have --> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]
        ```

        The given array will always contain numbers. There will only be numbers > 0.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We need to transform a list of integers into a nested list structure based on specific rules. The transformation process involves multiple runs, alternating the direction of processing (left-to-right, then right-to-left, and so on). Each run involves checking each number in the list and deciding whether to include it directly or as part of a sub-array, based on the remainder of the division of the number by the count of remaining elements.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Initialize the Process**: Start with the given list and the specified depth of transformation.

        2. **Iterate Over Depth**: For each depth level, process the list in alternating directions:
           - **Left-to-Right**: Start from the beginning of the list.
           - **Right-to-Left**: Start from the end of the list.

        3. **Process Each Element**:
           - Calculate the remainder of the current element divided by the number of remaining elements.
           - If the remainder is less than 3, add the element directly to the new list.
           - If the remainder is 3 or more, create a sub-array with the next `remainder` elements and add it to the new list.

        4. **Recursive Processing**: If a sub-array is created, apply the same rules recursively to the sub-array.

        5. **Output the Result**: After processing all depth levels, the list should be fully transformed.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function unflatten(flat_array, depth):
            for each level in depth:
                if level is even:
                    process from left to right
                else:
                    process from right to left
        
                initialize new_array
                while there are elements in flat_array:
                    calculate remainder = current_element % remaining_elements
                    if remainder < 3:
                        add current_element to new_array
                    else:
                        create sub-array with next 'remainder' elements
                        add sub-array to new_array
                        skip 'remainder' elements in flat_array
        
                set flat_array to new_array for next level

            return flat_array
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def process_subarray(array, direction):
            result = []
            i = 0 if direction == 'left' else len(array) - 1
            step = 1 if direction == 'left' else -1
    
            while 0 <= i < len(array):
                remaining_elements = len(array) - i if direction == 'left' else i + 1
                current = array[i]
                remainder = current % remaining_elements
        
                if remainder < 3:
                    result.append(current)
                    i += step
                else:
                    if direction == 'left':
                        subarray = array[i:i + remainder]
                        result.append(process_subarray(subarray, direction))
                        i += remainder
                    else:
                        subarray = array[i - remainder + 1:i + 1]
                        result.append(process_subarray(subarray, direction))
                        i -= remainder
    
            return result

        def unflatten(flat_array, depth):
            direction = 'left'
            for _ in range(depth):
                flat_array = process_subarray(flat_array, direction)
                direction = 'right' if direction == 'left' else 'left'
    
            return flat_array
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **process_subarray**: This helper function processes a given array in a specified direction ('left' or 'right'). It calculates the remainder for each element and decides whether to add it directly or as part of a sub-array.
        - **unflatten**: This function manages the overall process, iterating over the specified depth and alternating the direction of processing. It uses `process_subarray` to transform the list at each depth level.
