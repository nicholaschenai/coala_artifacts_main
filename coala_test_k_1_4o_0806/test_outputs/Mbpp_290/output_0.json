    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the list with the maximum length from a given list of lists. The function should return a tuple containing the length of this longest list and the list itself.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   We will iterate through each list in the list of lists and keep track of the longest list encountered so far. We will maintain a variable to store the maximum length found and another variable to store the corresponding list. As we iterate, if we find a list longer than the current maximum, we update both the maximum length and the list. Finally, we return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_length(list_of_lists):\n       max_len = 0\n       longest_list = []\n       \n       for each list in list_of_lists:\n           if length of list > max_len:\n               max_len = length of list\n               longest_list = list\n       \n       return (max_len, longest_list)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_length(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum length and the longest list\n    max_len = 0\n    longest_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each list in the list of lists\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        # Check if the current list is longer than the current maximum length\n        if len(lst) > max_len:\n            # Update the maximum length and the longest list\n            max_len = len(lst)\n            longest_list = lst\n    \n    # Return a tuple containing the maximum length and the longest list\n    return (max_len, longest_list)\n```",
