INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/95 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the smallest list within that list of lists.

### Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through each list in the list of lists.
2. For each list, we will calculate its length.
3. We will keep track of the smallest length encountered during the iteration.
4. Finally, we will return the smallest length found.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `Find_Min_Length` that takes a parameter `list_of_lists`.
2. Initialize a variable `min_length` with a very large number (or the length of the first list).
3. For each `lst` in `list_of_lists`:
   - Calculate the length of `lst`.
   - If this length is smaller than `min_length`, update `min_length`.
4. Return `min_length`.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):
    # Initialize min_length with a large number
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        # Calculate the length of the current list
        current_length = len(lst)
        
        # Update min_length if the current list's length is smaller
        if current_length < min_length:
            min_length = current_length
    
    # Return the smallest length found
    return min_length
```

    Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

    Example:


    Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.

    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.

    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            if not nums:
                return 0
        
            n = len(nums)
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/95 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the shortest list within that list of lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each list in the list of lists and determine its length. We will keep track of the smallest length encountered during this iteration. Finally, we will return this smallest length as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function Find_Min_Length that takes a list of lists as input.
   Initialize a variable min_length to a very large number (infinity).
   For each list in the list of lists:
       Calculate the length of the current list.
       If this length is smaller than min_length, update min_length with this length.
   Return min_length.
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def Find_Min_Length(lists: list) -> int:
    # Initialize min_length to a large number
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists
    for lst in lists:
        # Calculate the length of the current list
        current_length = len(lst)
        
        # Update min_length if the current list's length is smaller
        if current_length < min_length:
            min_length = current_length
    
    # Return the smallest length found
    return min_length
```

This function will correctly find and return the length of the smallest list in the given list of lists.
