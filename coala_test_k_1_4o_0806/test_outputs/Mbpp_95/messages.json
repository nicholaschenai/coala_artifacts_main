We will iterate through each list in the list of lists.\n2. For each list, we will calculate its length.\n3. We will keep track of the smallest length encountered during the iteration.\n4. Finally, we will return the smallest length found.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `Find_Min_Length` that takes a parameter `list_of_lists`.\n2. Initialize a variable `min_length` with a very large number (or the length of the first list).\n3. For each `lst` in `list_of_lists`:\n   - Calculate the length of `lst`.\n   - If this length is smaller than `min_length`, update `min_length`.\n4. Return `min_length`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize min_length with a large number\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists\n    for lst in list_of_lists:\n        # Calculate the length of the current list\n        current_length = len(lst)\n        \n        # Update min_length if the current list's length is smaller\n        if current_length < min_length:\n            min_length = current_length\n    \n    # Return the smallest length found\n    return min_length\n```"

The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.\n\n    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.\n\n    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            n = len(nums)\n            d = [1] * n\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
