    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the shortest list within that list of lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each list in the list of lists and determine its length. We will keep track of the smallest length encountered during this iteration. Finally, we will return this smallest length as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function Find_Min_Length that takes a list of lists as input.\n   Initialize a variable min_length to a very large number (infinity).\n   For each list in the list of lists:\n       Calculate the length of the current list.\n       If this length is smaller than min_length, update min_length with this length.\n   Return min_length.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min_Length(lists: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize min_length to a large number\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate over each list in the list of lists\n    for lst in lists:\n        # Calculate the length of the current list\n        current_length = len(lst)\n        \n        # Update min_length if the current list's length is smaller\n        if current_length < min_length:\n            min_length = current_length\n    \n    # Return the smallest length found\n    return min_length\n```\n\nThis function will correctly find and return the length of the smallest list in the given list of lists.",
