### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum and average of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should return a tuple containing the sum and the average.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Sum of First n Natural Numbers**: The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the arithmetic series sum formula.

2. **Average of First n Natural Numbers**: Once we have the sum, the average can be calculated by dividing the sum by `n`.

3. **Return the Result**: The function should return a tuple containing the sum and the average.

### Pseudocode

```
function sum_average(n):
    sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
    average = sum / n
    return (sum, average)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_average(n: int) -> tuple:
    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula
    sum_n = (n * (n + 1)) // 2
    
    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by n
    average_n = sum_n / n
    
    # Return the sum and average as a tuple
    return (sum_n, average_n)
```

This solution efficiently calculates the sum and average using mathematical formulas, ensuring that the function runs in constant time, O(1). The use of integer division `//` ensures that the sum is an integer, which is appropriate since the sum of natural numbers is always an integer. The average is calculated as a float, which is suitable for the division operation.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:

    1. **Formula Derivation**:
       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.

    2. **Handling the First Term**:
       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.

    3. **Efficiency**:
       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.

    4. **Code Simplicity**:
       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.

    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/599 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the sum and average of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should return a tuple containing these two values.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, we can use the formula: 
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   This formula gives the sum directly without needing to iterate through each number. 

   To find the average, we divide the sum by `n`:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum}}{n}
   \]

   The function will return a tuple with the sum and the average.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function sum_average(n):
       calculate sum using the formula: n * (n + 1) / 2
       calculate average by dividing sum by n
       return (sum, average)
