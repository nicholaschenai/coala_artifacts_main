    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum and average of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should return a tuple containing these two values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, we can use the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   This formula gives the sum directly without needing to iterate through each number. \n\n   To find the average, we divide the sum by `n`:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{\\text{Sum}}{n}\n   \\]\n\n   The function will return a tuple with the sum and the average.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function sum_average(n):\n       calculate sum using the formula: n * (n + 1) / 2\n       calculate average by dividing sum by n\n       return (sum, average)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_average(n: int) -> tuple:\n    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula\n    total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Use integer division for exact result\n    \n    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by n\n    average = total_sum / n  # Division to get a float result\n    \n    # Return the sum and average as a tuple\n    return (total_sum, average)\n```",
