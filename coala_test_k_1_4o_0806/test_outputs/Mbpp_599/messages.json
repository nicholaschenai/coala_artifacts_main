The function should return a tuple containing the sum and the average.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Sum of First n Natural Numbers**: The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sum} = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   This formula is derived from the arithmetic series sum formula.\n\n2. **Average of First n Natural Numbers**: Once we have the sum, the average can be calculated by dividing the sum by `n`.\n\n3. **Return the Result**: The function should return a tuple containing the sum and the average.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction sum_average(n):\n    sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2\n    average = sum / n\n    return (sum, average)\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef sum_average(n: int) -> tuple:\n    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula\n    sum_n = (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n    \n    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by n\n    average_n = sum_n / n\n    \n    # Return the sum and average as a tuple\n    return (sum_n, average_n)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the sum and average using mathematical formulas, ensuring that the function runs in constant time, O(1). The use of integer division `//` ensures that the sum is an integer, which is appropriate since the sum of natural numbers is always an integer. The average is calculated as a float, which is suitable for the division operation."

However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:\n\n    1. **Formula Derivation**:\n       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.\n\n    2. **Handling the First Term**:\n       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**:\n       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.\n\n    4. **Code Simplicity**:\n       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.\n\n    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
