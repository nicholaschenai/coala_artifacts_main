INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/74 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function `is_samepatterns` that checks if two lists follow the same pattern. Specifically, the function should return `True` if the sequence of elements in the first list can be mapped to the sequence of elements in the second list in a one-to-one manner, and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Mapping Concept**: We need to establish a one-to-one mapping between elements of the first list and elements of the second list. This means each unique element in the first list should correspond to a unique element in the second list and vice versa.

2. **Iterate and Map**: As we iterate through both lists simultaneously, we will maintain two dictionaries:
   - `pattern_to_value`: Maps elements from the second list to elements in the first list.
   - `value_to_pattern`: Maps elements from the first list to elements in the second list.

3. **Check Consistency**: For each pair of elements from the two lists:
   - If the element from the second list is already in `pattern_to_value`, check if it maps to the current element from the first list.
   - If the element from the first list is already in `value_to_pattern`, check if it maps to the current element from the second list.
   - If any of these checks fail, return `False`.

4. **Return True**: If we can iterate through both lists without any mapping inconsistencies, return `True`.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_samepatterns(values, patterns):
    if length of values is not equal to length of patterns:
        return False
    
    initialize pattern_to_value as an empty dictionary
    initialize value_to_pattern as an empty dictionary
    
    for each pair (value, pattern) in zip(values, patterns):
        if pattern in pattern_to_value:
            if pattern_to_value[pattern] is not equal to value:
                return False
        else:
            pattern_to_value[pattern] = value
        
        if value in value_to_pattern:
            if value_to_pattern[value] is not equal to pattern:
                return False
        else:
            value_to_pattern[value] = pattern
    
    return True
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_samepatterns(values, patterns):
    # If the lengths of the lists are not equal, they cannot follow the same pattern
    if len(values) != len(patterns):
        return False
    
    # Dictionaries to store the mapping from patterns to values and vice versa
    pattern_to_value = {}
    value_to_pattern = {}
    
    # Iterate over both lists simultaneously
    for value, pattern in zip(values, patterns):
        # Check if the pattern is already mapped to a value
        if pattern in pattern_to_value:
            # If the current value does not match the mapped value, return False
            if pattern_to_value[pattern] != value:
                return False
        else:
            # Map the pattern to the current value
            pattern_to_value[pattern] = value
        
        # Check if the value is already mapped to a pattern
        if value in value_to_pattern:
            # If the current pattern does not match the mapped pattern, return False
            if value_to_pattern[value] != pattern:
                return False
        else:
            # Map the value to the current pattern
            value_to_pattern[value] = pattern
    
    # If all checks pass, the lists follow the same pattern
    return True

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this pattern generation task, I encountered a few key insights:

    1. **Pattern Understanding**: The main challenge was correctly understanding the pattern generation logic. The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.

    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.

    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.

    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:
    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.
    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.
    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. 

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/74 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if two lists, `patterns` and `sequence`, follow the same pattern. This means that the relative ordering and repetition of elements in `patterns` should match the relative ordering and repetition of elements in `sequence`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can map each unique element in `patterns` to a unique element in `sequence` and check if the mapping is consistent throughout both lists. If the mapping holds true for the entire length of the lists, then the two lists follow the same pattern.

## Pseudocode

1. Check if the lengths of `patterns` and `sequence` are the same. If not, return `False`.
2. Initialize two dictionaries: `pattern_to_sequence` and `sequence_to_pattern`.
3. Iterate over the elements of `patterns` and `sequence` simultaneously:
   - For each pair of elements `(p, s)`:
     - If `p` is already in `pattern_to_sequence`, check if `pattern_to_sequence[p]` is equal to `s`. If not, return `False`.
     - If `s` is already in `sequence_to_pattern`, check if `sequence_to_pattern[s]` is equal to `p`. If not, return `False`.
     - Otherwise, add the mapping `p -> s` to `pattern_to_sequence` and `s -> p` to `sequence_to_pattern`.
4. If the loop completes without returning `False`, return `True`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def is_samepatterns(patterns: list, sequence: list) -> bool:
    # Check if the lengths of the two lists are the same
    if len(patterns) != len(sequence):
        return False
    
    # Initialize dictionaries to store mappings
    pattern_to_sequence = {}
    sequence_to_pattern = {}
    
    # Iterate over both lists simultaneously
    for p, s in zip(patterns, sequence):
        # Check if there is a conflicting mapping in pattern_to_sequence
        if p in pattern_to_sequence:
            if pattern_to_sequence[p] != s:
                return False
        else:
            pattern_to_sequence[p] = s
        
        # Check if there is a conflicting mapping in sequence_to_pattern
        if s in sequence_to_pattern:

                return False
        else:
            sequence_to_pattern[s] = p
    
    # If no conflicts were found, the patterns match
    return True
```

This solution checks for a consistent one-to-one mapping between elements of `patterns` and `sequence`, ensuring that both lists follow the same pattern.
