    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if two lists, `patterns` and `sequence`, follow the same pattern. This means that the relative ordering and repetition of elements in `patterns` should match the relative ordering and repetition of elements in `sequence`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can map each unique element in `patterns` to a unique element in `sequence` and check if the mapping is consistent throughout both lists. If the mapping holds true for the entire length of the lists, then the two lists follow the same pattern.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Check if the lengths of `patterns` and `sequence` are the same. If not, return `False`.\n2. Initialize two dictionaries: `pattern_to_sequence` and `sequence_to_pattern`.\n3. Iterate over the elements of `patterns` and `sequence` simultaneously:\n   - For each pair of elements `(p, s)`:\n     - If `p` is already in `pattern_to_sequence`, check if `pattern_to_sequence[p]` is equal to `s`. If not, return `False`.\n     - If `s` is already in `sequence_to_pattern`, check if `sequence_to_pattern[s]` is equal to `p`. If not, return `False`.\n     - Otherwise, add the mapping `p -> s` to `pattern_to_sequence` and `s -> p` to `sequence_to_pattern`.\n4. If the loop completes without returning `False`, return `True`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_samepatterns(patterns: list, sequence: list) -> bool:\n    # Check if the lengths of the two lists are the same\n    if len(patterns) != len(sequence):\n        return False\n    \n    # Initialize dictionaries to store mappings\n    pattern_to_sequence = {}\n    sequence_to_pattern = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over both lists simultaneously\n    for p, s in zip(patterns, sequence):\n        # Check if there is a conflicting mapping in pattern_to_sequence\n        if p in pattern_to_sequence:\n            if pattern_to_sequence[p] != s:\n                return False\n        else:\n            pattern_to_sequence[p] = s\n        \n        # Check if there is a conflicting mapping in sequence_to_pattern\n        if s in sequence_to_pattern:\n            if sequence_to_pattern[s] != p:\n                return False\n        else:\n            sequence_to_pattern[s] = p\n    \n    # If no conflicts were found, the patterns match\n    return True\n```\n\nThis solution checks for a consistent one-to-one mapping between elements of `patterns` and `sequence`, ensuring that both lists follow the same pattern.",
