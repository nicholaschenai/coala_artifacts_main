INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/91 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that checks if a given substring is present in any of the strings within a list. If the substring is found in at least one of the strings, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over each string in the list.
   - For each string, we will check if the given substring is present.
   - If we find the substring in any string, we will immediately return `True`.
   - If we finish checking all strings and do not find the substring, we will return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function find_substring(list_of_strings, substring):
       for each string in list_of_strings:
           if substring is in string:
               return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_substring(list_of_strings, substring):
    # Iterate over each string in the provided list
    for string in list_of_strings:
        # Check if the substring is present in the current string
        if substring in string:
            # If found, return True immediately
            return True
    # If the loop completes without finding the substring, return False
    return False
```

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a list of strings, and we need to find the shortest string that contains each of the given strings as a substring. None of the strings in the list is a substring of another. The solution should be able to handle up to 12 strings, each with a length of up to 20 characters.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively merge strings by overlapping them as much as possible. We can calculate the overlap between two strings and use this information to build the shortest superstring. We will use a dynamic programming table to store the shortest superstring that can be formed using a subset of the strings, and we will update this table as we consider each string.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Define a function to calculate the overlap between two strings.
           Initialize a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset of strings.
           Initialize a table to store the path to reconstruct the superstring.
           For each subset of strings:
               For each string in the subset:
                   Calculate the shortest superstring by considering the overlap with other strings.
                   Update the DP table with the shortest superstring length.
                   Update the path table to keep track of the order of strings.
           Reconstruct the shortest superstring using the path table.
           Return the shortest superstring.
           ```

        ```python

                                path[mask][i] = j

                # Find the end of the shortest superstring
                max_len = -1
                last = -1
                full_mask = (1 << n) - 1
                for i in range(n):
                    if dp[full_mask][i] > max_len:
                        max_len = dp[full_mask][i]
                        last = i

                # Reconstruct the shortest superstring
                superstring = []
                mask = full_mask
                while last != -1:
                    superstring.append(last)
                    next_last = path[mask][last]
                    mask ^= (1 << last)
                    last = next_last

                # Build the final superstring
                superstring.reverse()
                result = A[superstring[0]]
                for k in range(1, len(superstring)):
                    i, j = superstring[k-1], superstring[k]
                    o = overlap(A[i], A[j])
                    result += A[j][o:]

                return result
        ```

        This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the shortest superstring by considering all possible overlaps between the strings. The `overlap` function calculates the maximum overlap between two strings, which is used to update the DP table. The `path` table helps reconstruct the order of strings in the final superstring.
