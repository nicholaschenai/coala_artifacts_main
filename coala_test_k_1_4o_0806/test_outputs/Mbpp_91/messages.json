If the substring is found in at least one of the strings, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each string in the list.\n   - For each string, we will check if the given substring is present.\n   - If we find the substring in any string, we will immediately return `True`.\n   - If we finish checking all strings and do not find the substring, we will return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_substring(list_of_strings, substring):\n       for each string in list_of_strings:\n           if substring is in string:\n               return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_substring(list_of_strings, substring):\n    # Iterate over each string in the provided list\n    for string in list_of_strings:\n        # Check if the substring is present in the current string\n        if substring in string:\n            # If found, return True immediately\n            return True\n    # If the loop completes without finding the substring, return False\n    return False\n```"

We will use a dynamic programming table to store the shortest superstring that can be formed using a subset of the strings, and we will update this table as we consider each string.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           Define a function to calculate the overlap between two strings.\n           Initialize a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset of strings.\n           Initialize a table to store the path to reconstruct the superstring.\n           For each subset of strings:\n               For each string in the subset:\n                   Calculate the shortest superstring by considering the overlap with other strings.\n                   Update the DP table with the shortest superstring length.\n                   Update the path table to keep track of the order of strings.\n           Reconstruct the shortest superstring using the path table.\n           Return the shortest superstring.\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        from typing import List\n\n        class Solution:\n            def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:\n                # Helper function to calculate the overlap between two strings\n                def overlap(s1, s2):\n                    max_overlap = 0\n                    # Check all possible overlaps\n                    for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n                        if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n                            max_overlap = i\n                    return max_overlap\n\n                n = len(A)\n                # DP table to store the shortest superstring length for each subset\n                dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n                # Path table to reconstruct the superstring\n                path = [[-1] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n\n                # Fill the DP table\n                for mask in range(1, 1 << n):\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        if not (mask & (1 << i)):\n                            continue\n                        prev_mask = mask ^ (1 << i)\n                        if prev_mask == 0:\n                            continue\n                        for j in range(n):\n                            if not (prev_mask & (1 << j)):\n                                continue\n                            # Calculate overlap between A[j] and A[i]\n                            o = overlap(A[j], A[i])\n                            # Update DP table if a shorter superstring is found\n                            if dp[mask][i] < dp[prev_mask][j] + o:\n                                dp[mask][i] = dp[prev_mask][j] + o\n                                path[mask][i] = j\n\n                # Find the end of the shortest superstring\n                max_len = -1\n                last = -1\n                full_mask = (1 << n) - 1\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if dp[full_mask][i] > max_len:\n                        max_len = dp[full_mask][i]\n                        last = i\n\n                # Reconstruct the shortest superstring\n                superstring = []\n                mask = full_mask\n                while last != -1:\n                    superstring.append(last)\n                    next_last = path[mask][last]\n                    mask ^= (1 << last)\n                    last = next_last\n\n                # Build the final superstring\n                superstring.reverse()\n                result = A[superstring[0]]\n                for k in range(1, len(superstring)):\n                    i, j = superstring[k-1], superstring[k]\n                    o = overlap(A[i], A[j])\n                    result += A[j][o:]\n\n                return result\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the shortest superstring by considering all possible overlaps between the strings.
