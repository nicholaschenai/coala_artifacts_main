    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that counts the total number of characters in a given string. The function should return this count as an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in `len()` function, which returns the number of characters in a string. This function will give us the total count of characters directly.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function count_charac that takes a string as input\n   Use the len() function to get the number of characters in the string\n   Return the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_charac(s: str) -> int:\n    # Use the built-in len() function to count the number of characters in the string\n    return len(s)\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `len()` function to efficiently count and return the number of characters in the input string.",
