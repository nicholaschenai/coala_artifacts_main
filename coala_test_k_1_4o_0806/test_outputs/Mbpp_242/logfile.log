INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/242 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns the total number of characters in that string.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in `len()` function, which returns the number of characters in a string. The function will take a single string as input and return the length of that string using `len()`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function named count_charac that takes a single parameter, input_string.
   Use the len() function to calculate the number of characters in input_string.
   Return the result from len().
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def count_charac(input_string: str) -> int:
    # Use the len() function to get the number of characters in the input string
    return len(input_string)
```

This function will correctly count and return the number of characters in any given string.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We need to create a function that evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string. The expression can include non-negative integers, the operators `+` and `-`, parentheses `(` and `)`, and spaces. The function should return the result of the expression as an integer. We cannot use Python's `eval` function.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to handle the operations and parentheses. We will iterate through the string character by character. When we encounter a number, we will parse it and push it onto a stack. When we encounter an operator, we will apply it to the top numbers on the stack. Parentheses will be used to control the order of operations, and we will use a stack to manage them. Spaces will be ignored. The final result will be the value left on the stack after processing the entire string.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Initialize a stack to store numbers and results
           Initialize a variable to store the current number
           Initialize a variable to store the current sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative)
           Initialize a variable to store the result

           Iterate over each character in the string:
               If the character is a digit:
                   Update the current number by appending the digit
               If the character is a '+' or '-':
                   Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result
                   Update the sign based on the character
                   Reset the current number to 0
               If the character is '(':
                   Push the current result and sign onto the stack
                   Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression
               If the character is ')':
                   Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result
                   Pop the sign and previous result from the stack and update the result
                   Reset the current number to 0
               Ignore spaces

           After the loop, add the last number to the result
           Return the result
           ```

                stack = []
                # Initialize the current number, result, and sign
                current_number = 0
                result = 0
                sign = 1

                for char in s:
                    if char.isdigit():
                        # Build the current number
                        current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
                    elif char == '+':
                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                        result += sign * current_number
                        # Update the sign to positive
                        sign = 1

                        current_number = 0
                    elif char == '-':
                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                        result += sign * current_number
                        # Update the sign to negative
                        sign = -1
                        # Reset the current number
                        current_number = 0
                    elif char == '(':
                        # Push the current result and sign onto the stack
                        stack.append(result)
                        stack.append(sign)
                        # Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression
                        result = 0
                        sign = 1
                    elif char == ')':
                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                        result += sign * current_number
                        # Pop the sign and previous result from the stack
                        result *= stack.pop()  # this is the sign
                        result += stack.pop()  # this is the previous result
                        # Reset the current number
                        current_number = 0
        
                # Add the last number to the result
                result += sign * current_number
                return result
        ```

        This solution uses a stack to manage the results and signs, processes each character in the string, and correctly handles parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.
