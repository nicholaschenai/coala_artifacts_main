INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/129 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given square matrix is a magic square. A magic square is a grid of numbers where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Check Dimensions**: First, ensure the matrix is square (i.e., the number of rows equals the number of columns).
2. **Calculate the Magic Sum**: Compute the sum of the first row. This will be the target sum that all other rows, columns, and diagonals should match.
3. **Check Rows**: Verify that the sum of each row equals the magic sum.
4. **Check Columns**: Verify that the sum of each column equals the magic sum.
5. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that the sum of both the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) equals the magic sum.
6. **Return Result**: If all checks pass, the matrix is a magic square; otherwise, it is not.

### Pseudocode

```
function magic_square_test(matrix):
    if not matrix or len(matrix) != len(matrix[0]):
        return False
    
    n = len(matrix)
    magic_sum = sum(matrix[0])
    
    for each row in matrix:
        if sum(row) != magic_sum:
            return False
    
    for col in range(n):
        if sum(matrix[row][col] for row in range(n)) != magic_sum:
            return False
    
    if sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:
        return False
    
    if sum(matrix[i][n - 1 - i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:
        return False
    
    return True
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def magic_square_test(matrix):
    # Check if the matrix is empty or not square
    if not matrix or len(matrix) != len(matrix[0]):
        return False
    
    n = len(matrix)
    # Calculate the magic sum using the first row
    magic_sum = sum(matrix[0])
    
    # Check each row sum
    for row in matrix:
        if sum(row) != magic_sum:
            return False
    
    # Check each column sum
    for col in range(n):
        if sum(matrix[row][col] for row in range(n)) != magic_sum:
            return False
    
    # Check the main diagonal sum
    if sum(matrix[i][i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:
        return False
    
    # Check the secondary diagonal sum
    if sum(matrix[i][n - 1 - i] for i in range(n)) != magic_sum:
        return False
    
    # If all checks pass, it is a magic square
    return True
```

This solution checks all necessary conditions for a matrix to be a magic square and returns `True` if it is, otherwise `False`.

    [description]
    The function determines if a given list of integers can be partitioned into four subsets with equal sums, effectively forming a square. It first checks if the list is empty or if the sum of the integers is not divisible by four, returning False in such cases. The target sum for each subset is calculated as the total sum divided by four, and the list is sorted in descending order to optimize the backtracking process. A recursive backtracking approach is used to try and assign each integer to one of the four sides, ensuring that no side exceeds the target sum. If a valid partitioning is found where all four sides equal the target sum, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

    [end of description]
    This knowledge is useful in scenarios involving combinatorial optimization and partitioning problems. Specifically, it applies to situations where you need to determine if a set of items can be divided into equal parts, such as forming a square with matchsticks of varying lengths. This problem is a variant of the subset sum problem, which is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. Understanding this solution can help in solving similar problems where you need to partition a set into subsets with equal sums, such as dividing resources evenly, creating balanced teams, or organizing items into groups with specific constraints. The backtracking approach used here is a common technique for exploring all possible combinations in search of a solution, which is applicable in many other problem-solving contexts.
