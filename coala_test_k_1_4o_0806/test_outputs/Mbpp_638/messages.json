The result should be rounded to the nearest integer.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Wind Chill Formula**: The wind chill index is a measure of how cold it feels when the wind is factored in with the actual air temperature. The formula to calculate the wind chill index in Celsius is:\n   \\[\n   WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215 \\times T - 11.37 \\times V^{0.16} + 0.3965 \\times T \\times V^{0.16}\n   \\]\n   where \\( T \\) is the temperature in Celsius and \\( V \\) is the wind velocity in km/h.\n\n2. **Calculate the Wind Chill Index**: Use the formula to compute the wind chill index using the provided temperature and wind velocity.\n\n3. **Round the Result**: Round the calculated wind chill index to the nearest integer.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Return the rounded wind chill index.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction wind_chill(velocity, temperature):\n    calculate WCI using the formula:\n        WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * (velocity ** 0.16) + 0.3965 * temperature * (velocity ** 0.16)\n    round WCI to the nearest integer\n    return the rounded WCI\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef wind_chill(velocity: float, temperature: float) -> int:\n    # Calculate the wind chill index using the given formula\n    WCI = 13.12 + 0.6215 * temperature - 11.37 * (velocity ** 0.16) + 0.3965 * temperature * (velocity ** 0.16)\n    \n    # Round the wind chill index to the nearest integer\n    rounded_WCI = round(WCI)\n    \n    # Return the rounded wind chill index\n    return rounded_WCI\n```"

Here are some key insights and takeaways from the experience:\n\n    1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem required careful tracking of temperature ranges over time, ensuring that the temperature at each customer's visit time falls within their preferred range. This required a dynamic adjustment of possible temperature ranges as time progressed.\n\n    2. **Iterative Range Adjustment**: Both my solution and the official solution used a similar strategy of iteratively adjusting the possible temperature range based on the time elapsed and the customer's preferred range. This involved calculating the minimum and maximum possible temperatures at each step and checking for feasibility.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**: The approach is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, where n is the number of customers. This is optimal given the constraints, as we need to process each customer's data sequentially.\n\n    4. **Edge Cases**: The solution correctly handles edge cases, such as when the initial temperature is already outside the first customer's range or when the time difference between customers is large, allowing for significant temperature adjustments.\n\n    5. **Code Structure**: The official solution uses a tuple to track the current temperature range, which is a neat way to handle the lower and upper bounds. My solution used separate variables for min and max temperatures, which is functionally equivalent but slightly less concise.\n\n    Overall, this problem reinforced the importance of maintaining and updating state variables (in this case, temperature ranges) as new data (customer preferences) is processed. The problem was a good exercise in dynamic range management and ensuring logical consistency across sequential constraints.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
