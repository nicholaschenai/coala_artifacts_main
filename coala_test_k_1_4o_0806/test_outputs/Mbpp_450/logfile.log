INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/450 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a list of strings and an integer as inputs. The function should return a new list containing only the strings from the original list that have a length equal to the given integer.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over each string in the input list.
   - For each string, we will check if its length matches the specified integer.
   - If the length matches, we will add the string to a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list containing all the strings of the specified length.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function extract_string with parameters string_list and size
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each string in string_list
           If the length of the string is equal to size
               Append the string to result
       Return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def extract_string(string_list, size):
    # Initialize an empty list to store strings of the specified length
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each string in the input list
    for string in string_list:
        # Check if the length of the current string matches the specified size
        if len(string) == size:
            # If it matches, add the string to the result list
            result.append(string)
    
    # Return the list of strings that have the specified length
    return result
```

This function will correctly filter and return strings from the input list that have a length equal to the specified size.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this pattern generation task, I encountered a few key insights:

    1. **Pattern Understanding**: The main challenge was correctly understanding the pattern generation logic. The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.

    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.

    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.

    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:
    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.
    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.
    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. 

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.
