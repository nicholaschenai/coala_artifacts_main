INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/267 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, the first two odd natural numbers are 1 and 3, and their squares are 1 and 9, respectively. The sum of these squares is 10.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: The sequence of odd natural numbers starts from 1 and follows the pattern: 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. The `i-th` odd number can be represented as `2*i - 1`.
2. **Square Each Odd Number**: For each of the first `n` odd numbers, calculate its square.
3. **Sum the Squares**: Accumulate the sum of these squares.
4. **Return the Result**: Return the accumulated sum as the result.

### Pseudocode

```
function square_Sum(n):
    initialize sum to 0
    for i from 1 to n:
        calculate the i-th odd number as 2*i - 1
        square this odd number
        add the square to sum
    return sum
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def square_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum_of_squares = 0
    
    # Loop through the first n odd numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the i-th odd number
        odd_number = 2 * i - 1
        # Add the square of the odd number to the sum
        sum_of_squares += odd_number ** 2
    
    # Return the total sum of squares
    return sum_of_squares
```

This function calculates the sum of the squares of the first `n` odd natural numbers by iterating through the first `n` odd numbers, squaring each, and accumulating the result.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.

    ### Strategy:
    - I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.
    - This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).

    ### Implementation:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.
