    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest word in that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each word in the list and calculate its length. We will keep track of the maximum length encountered during this iteration. Finally, we will return this maximum length as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function len_log that takes a list of strings as input.\n   Initialize a variable max_length to 0.\n   For each word in the list:\n       Calculate the length of the word.\n       If this length is greater than max_length, update max_length.\n   Return max_length.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef len_log(words: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum length to 0\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the list\n    for word in words:\n        # Calculate the length of the current word\n        word_length = len(word)\n        \n        # Update max_length if the current word's length is greater\n        if word_length > max_length:\n            max_length = word_length\n    \n    # Return the maximum length found\n    return max_length\n```",
