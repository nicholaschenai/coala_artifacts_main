INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/90 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest word in that list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate through each word in the list.
2. For each word, we will calculate its length.
3. We will keep track of the maximum length encountered so far.
4. After checking all words, we will return the maximum length found.

### Pseudocode

```
function len_log(words):
    initialize max_length to 0
    for each word in words:
        calculate the length of the word
        if the length is greater than max_length:
            update max_length to this length
    return max_length
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def len_log(words: list) -> int:
    # Initialize the maximum length to 0
    max_length = 0
    
    # Iterate over each word in the list
    for word in words:
        # Calculate the length of the current word
        current_length = len(word)
        
        # If the current word's length is greater than the max_length, update max_length
        if current_length > max_length:
            max_length = current_length
    
    # Return the maximum length found
    return max_length
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.

    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.

    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            if not nums:
                return 0
        
            n = len(nums)
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/90 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest word in that list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each word in the list and calculate its length. We will keep track of the maximum length encountered during this iteration. Finally, we will return this maximum length as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function len_log that takes a list of strings as input.
   Initialize a variable max_length to 0.
   For each word in the list:
       Calculate the length of the word.
       If this length is greater than max_length, update max_length.
