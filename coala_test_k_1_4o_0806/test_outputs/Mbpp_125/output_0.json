    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum difference between the number of 0s and the number of 1s in any substring of a given binary string. A substring is any contiguous sequence of characters within the string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a variation of Kadane's algorithm, which is typically used to find the maximum sum subarray. Here, instead of dealing with sums, we will treat '0' as +1 and '1' as -1. This way, the problem of finding the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in a substring becomes equivalent to finding the maximum sum subarray in an array of +1s and -1s. The maximum sum will represent the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize max_diff to 0\n   Initialize current_diff to 0\n\n   For each character in the binary string:\n       If the character is '0':\n           Increment current_diff by 1\n       Else if the character is '1':\n           Decrement current_diff by 1\n\n       If current_diff is greater than max_diff:\n           Update max_diff to current_diff\n\n       If current_diff is less than 0:\n           Reset current_diff to 0\n\n   Return max_diff\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_length(binary_string: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum difference found so far to 0\n    max_diff = 0\n    # Initialize the current difference to 0\n    current_diff = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each character in the binary string\n    for char in binary_string:\n        # If the character is '0', treat it as +1\n        if char == '0':\n            current_diff += 1\n        # If the character is '1', treat it as -1\n        else:\n            current_diff -= 1\n\n        # Update the maximum difference if the current difference is greater\n        if current_diff > max_diff:\n            max_diff = current_diff\n\n        # If the current difference becomes negative, reset it to 0\n        if current_diff < 0:\n            current_diff = 0\n\n    # Return the maximum difference found\n    return max_diff\n```",
