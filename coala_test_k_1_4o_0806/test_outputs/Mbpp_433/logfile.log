INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/433 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if a given number is greater than all the elements in a provided list. If the number is greater than every element in the list, the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate through each element in the list.
2. Compare the given number with each element.
3. If the number is found to be less than or equal to any element in the list, return `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any element greater than or equal to the number, return `True`.

### Pseudocode

```
function check_greater(arr, num):
    for each element in arr:
        if num is less than or equal to element:
            return False
    return True
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def check_greater(arr, num):
    # Iterate through each element in the array
    for element in arr:
        # If the number is less than or equal to the current element
        if num <= element:
            # Return False as the number is not greater than this element
            return False
    # If the loop completes, the number is greater than all elements
    return True
```

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence within this list. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements. The task is to determine the length of the longest subsequence where each element is greater than the preceding one.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We will maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. Initially, each element in `d` is set to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element in the list, we will check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence will be the maximum value in the `d` array.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function lengthOfLIS(nums):
               if nums is empty:
                   return 0
       
               n = length of nums
               d = array of size n initialized to 1
       
               for i from 1 to n-1:
                   for j from 0 to i-1:
                       if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                           d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
       
               return max value in d
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                # If the input list is empty, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 0
                if not nums:
                    return 0
        
                # Initialize the dynamic programming array with 1s
                # Each element is a subsequence of length 1 by itself
                n = len(nums)
                d = [1] * n
        
                # Iterate over each element in the list
                for i in range(1, n):
                    # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence
                    for j in range(i):
                        if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                            # Update the dp array to reflect the longest subsequence ending at i
                            d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
                # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the dp array
                return max(d)
        ```

        This solution uses dynamic programming to achieve an O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable for the problem's requirements.
