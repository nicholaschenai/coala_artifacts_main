A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements. The task is to determine the length of the longest subsequence where each element is greater than the preceding one.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We will maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. Initially, each element in `d` is set to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element in the list, we will check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence will be the maximum value in the `d` array.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function lengthOfLIS(nums):\n               if nums is empty:\n                   return 0\n       \n               n = length of nums\n               d = array of size n initialized to 1\n       \n               for i from 1 to n-1:\n                   for j from 0 to i-1:\n                       if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                           d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n       \n               return max value in d\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n                # If the input list is empty, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 0\n                if not nums:\n                    return 0\n        \n                # Initialize the dynamic programming array with 1s\n                # Each element is a subsequence of length 1 by itself\n                n = len(nums)\n                d = [1] * n\n        \n                # Iterate over each element in the list\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence\n                    for j in range(i):\n                        if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                            # Update the dp array to reflect the longest subsequence ending at i\n                            d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n                # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the dp array\n                return max(d)\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses dynamic programming to achieve an O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable for the problem's requirements.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [[10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]] Output: 4\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
