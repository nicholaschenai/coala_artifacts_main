    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given number is greater than all the elements in a provided list of numbers. The function should return `True` if the number is greater than every element in the list, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each element in the list and compare it with the given number. If we find any element in the list that is greater than or equal to the given number, we will return `False`. If we complete the iteration without finding such an element, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function check_greater(arr, num):\n       for each element in arr:\n           if element is greater than or equal to num:\n               return False\n       return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_greater(arr, num):\n    # Iterate over each element in the array\n    for element in arr:\n        # If any element is greater than or equal to the given number\n        if element >= num:\n            # Return False because the number is not greater than all elements\n            return False\n    # If no element is greater than or equal to the number, return True\n    return True\n```",
