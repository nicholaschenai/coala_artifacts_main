INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/309 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - To solve this problem, we can compare the two numbers using a simple conditional statement. If the first number is greater than or equal to the second number, we return the first number. Otherwise, we return the second number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `maximum` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
   - Use an `if` statement to check if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
     - If true, return `a`.
     - Otherwise, return `b`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def maximum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Check if the first number is greater than or equal to the second number
    if a >= b:
        # If true, return the first number
        return a
    else:
        # Otherwise, return the second number
        return b
```

This function will correctly return the maximum of the two input numbers.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to determine the winner of a billiards game based on the maximum lead achieved by either player at any point during the game. The solution involved reading multiple rounds of scores, calculating cumulative scores, and tracking the maximum lead and the player who achieved it.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Cumulative Scores:** Continuously updating the scores for each player after every round.
    - **Lead Calculation:** Determining the lead by calculating the absolute difference between the cumulative scores of the two players.
    - **Tracking Maximum Lead:** Keeping track of the maximum lead encountered and the player who had this lead.

    ### Strategies and Fixes:
    - **Input Handling:** Initially, the function was not called, which led to no output. The fix was to ensure the function is called after its definition to process the input and generate the output.
    - **Standard Input/Output:** Using `sys.stdin.read()` to handle input and `print()` for output was effective for competitive programming environments.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def find_winner_and_lead():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().splitlines()
    
        N = int(data[0])
        player1_cumulative_score = 0
        player2_cumulative_score = 0
        max_lead = 0
        winner = 0
    
        for i in range(1, N + 1):
            Si, Ti = map(int, data[i].split())
            player1_cumulative_score += Si
            player2_cumulative_score += Ti
            current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)
        
            if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:
                current_leader = 1
            else:
                current_leader = 2
        
            if current_lead > max_lead:
                max_lead = current_lead
                winner = current_leader
    
        print(winner, max_lead)

    find_winner_and_lead()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are executed in scripts that rely on standard input/output, especially in competitive programming contexts.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/309 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a Python function that takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will create a function named `maximum` that accepts two arguments. Inside the function, we will compare the two numbers using a simple conditional statement. If the first number is greater than or equal to the second number, we will return the first number. Otherwise, we will return the second number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function maximum(a, b):
       If a is greater than or equal to b:
           Return a
       Else:
           Return b
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def maximum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Compare the two numbers
    if a >= b:
        # If a is greater than or equal to b, return a
        return a
    else:
        # Otherwise, return b
        return b
```

This function will correctly return the maximum of the two input numbers, satisfying the problem's requirements.
