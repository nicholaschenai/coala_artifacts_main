If the first number is greater than or equal to the second number, we return the first number. Otherwise, we return the second number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `maximum` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n   - Use an `if` statement to check if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.\n     - If true, return `a`.\n     - Otherwise, return `b`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef maximum(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Check if the first number is greater than or equal to the second number\n    if a >= b:\n        # If true, return the first number\n        return a\n    else:\n        # Otherwise, return the second number\n        return b\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the maximum of the two input numbers."

The solution involved reading multiple rounds of scores, calculating cumulative scores, and tracking the maximum lead and the player who achieved it.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Cumulative Scores:** Continuously updating the scores for each player after every round.\n    - **Lead Calculation:** Determining the lead by calculating the absolute difference between the cumulative scores of the two players.\n    - **Tracking Maximum Lead:** Keeping track of the maximum lead encountered and the player who had this lead.\n\n    ### Strategies and Fixes:\n    - **Input Handling:** Initially, the function was not called, which led to no output. The fix was to ensure the function is called after its definition to process the input and generate the output.\n    - **Standard Input/Output:** Using `sys.stdin.read()` to handle input and `print()` for output was effective for competitive programming environments.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def find_winner_and_lead():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().splitlines()\n    \n        N = int(data[0])\n        player1_cumulative_score = 0\n        player2_cumulative_score = 0\n        max_lead = 0\n        winner = 0\n    \n        for i in range(1, N + 1):\n            Si, Ti = map(int, data[i].split())\n            player1_cumulative_score += Si\n            player2_cumulative_score += Ti\n            current_lead = abs(player1_cumulative_score - player2_cumulative_score)\n        \n            if player1_cumulative_score > player2_cumulative_score:\n                current_leader = 1\n            else:\n                current_leader = 2\n        \n            if current_lead > max_lead:\n                max_lead = current_lead\n                winner = current_leader\n    \n        print(winner, max_lead)\n\n    find_winner_and_lead()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are executed in scripts that rely on standard input/output, especially in competitive programming contexts.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
