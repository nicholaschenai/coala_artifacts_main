        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that checks if a given string can be interpreted as an integer. If the string represents an integer, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Definition of an Integer String**: A string represents an integer if it consists solely of digits, possibly prefixed with a single '+' or '-' sign.\n2. **Steps to Check**:\n   - If the string is empty, it cannot represent an integer.\n   - If the string starts with a '+' or '-', remove this sign for further checks.\n   - After removing the sign (if any), check if the remaining part of the string consists only of digits.\n   - If it does, the string represents an integer; otherwise, it does not.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction check_integer(s):\n    if s is empty:\n        return False\n    if s starts with '+' or '-':\n        remove the first character\n    return True if the remaining string consists only of digits, else False\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef check_integer(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Check if the string is empty\n    if not s:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if the string starts with '+' or '-'\n    if s[0] in ('+', '-'):\n        # Remove the sign for further checks\n        s = s[1:]\n    \n    # Check if the remaining string consists only of digits\n    return s.isdigit()\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the string is empty, which cannot represent an integer. It then checks for a leading '+' or '-' and removes it if present. Finally, it checks if the remaining string consists only of digits using the `isdigit()` method, which returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, otherwise `False`."

The expression can include non-negative integers, the operators `+` and `-`, parentheses `(` and `)`, and spaces. The function should return the result of the expression as an integer. We cannot use Python's `eval` function.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to handle the operations and parentheses. We will iterate through the string character by character. When we encounter a number, we will parse it and push it onto a stack. When we encounter an operator, we will apply it to the top numbers on the stack. Parentheses will be used to control the order of operations, and we will use a stack to manage them. Spaces will be ignored. The final result will be the value left on the stack after processing the entire string.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           Initialize a stack to store numbers and results\n           Initialize a variable to store the current number\n           Initialize a variable to store the current sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative)\n           Initialize a variable to store the result\n\n           Iterate over each character in the string:\n               If the character is a digit:\n                   Update the current number by appending the digit\n               If the character is a '+' or '-':\n                   Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result\n                   Update the sign based on the character\n                   Reset the current number to 0\n               If the character is '(':\n                   Push the current result and sign onto the stack\n                   Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression\n               If the character is ')':\n                   Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result\n                   Pop the sign and previous result from the stack and update the result\n                   Reset the current number to 0\n               Ignore spaces\n\n           After the loop, add the last number to the result\n           Return the result\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n                # Initialize a stack to store results and signs\n                stack = []\n                # Initialize the current number, result, and sign\n                current_number = 0\n                result = 0\n                sign = 1\n        \n                # Iterate over each character in the string\n                for char in s:\n                    if char.isdigit():\n                        # Build the current number\n                        current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)\n                    elif char == '+':\n                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign\n                        result += sign * current_number\n                        # Update the sign to positive\n                        sign = 1\n                        # Reset the current number\n                        current_number = 0\n                    elif char == '-':\n                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign\n                        result += sign * current_number\n                        # Update the sign to negative\n                        sign = -1\n                        # Reset the current number\n                        current_number = 0\n                    elif char == '(':\n                        # Push the current result and sign onto the stack\n                        stack.append(result)\n                        stack.append(sign)\n                        # Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression\n                        result = 0\n                        sign = 1\n                    elif char == ')':\n                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign\n                        result += sign * current_number\n                        # Pop the sign and previous result from the stack\n                        result *= stack.pop()  # this is the sign\n                        result += stack.pop()  # this is the previous result\n                        # Reset the current number\n                        current_number = 0\n        \n                # Add the last number to the result\n                result += sign * current_number\n                return result\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses a stack to manage the results and signs, processes each character in the string, and correctly handles parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['\"1 + 1\"'] Output: 2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
