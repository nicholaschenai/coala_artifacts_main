INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/113 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that checks if a given string can be interpreted as an integer. If the string represents an integer, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Definition of an Integer String**: A string represents an integer if it consists solely of digits, possibly prefixed with a single '+' or '-' sign.
2. **Steps to Check**:
   - If the string is empty, it cannot represent an integer.
   - If the string starts with a '+' or '-', remove this sign for further checks.
   - After removing the sign (if any), check if the remaining part of the string consists only of digits.
   - If it does, the string represents an integer; otherwise, it does not.

### Pseudocode

```
function check_integer(s):
    if s is empty:
        return False
    if s starts with '+' or '-':
        remove the first character
    return True if the remaining string consists only of digits, else False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def check_integer(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if the string is empty
    if not s:
        return False
    
    # Check if the string starts with '+' or '-'
    if s[0] in ('+', '-'):
        # Remove the sign for further checks
        s = s[1:]
    
    # Check if the remaining string consists only of digits
    return s.isdigit()
```

This function first checks if the string is empty, which cannot represent an integer. It then checks for a leading '+' or '-' and removes it if present. Finally, it checks if the remaining string consists only of digits using the `isdigit()` method, which returns `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, otherwise `False`.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We need to create a function that evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string. The expression can include non-negative integers, the operators `+` and `-`, parentheses `(` and `)`, and spaces. The function should return the result of the expression as an integer. We cannot use Python's `eval` function.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to handle the operations and parentheses. We will iterate through the string character by character. When we encounter a number, we will parse it and push it onto a stack. When we encounter an operator, we will apply it to the top numbers on the stack. Parentheses will be used to control the order of operations, and we will use a stack to manage them. Spaces will be ignored. The final result will be the value left on the stack after processing the entire string.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Initialize a stack to store numbers and results
           Initialize a variable to store the current number
           Initialize a variable to store the current sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative)
           Initialize a variable to store the result

           Iterate over each character in the string:
               If the character is a digit:
                   Update the current number by appending the digit
               If the character is a '+' or '-':
                   Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result
                   Update the sign based on the character
                   Reset the current number to 0
               If the character is '(':
                   Push the current result and sign onto the stack
                   Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression
               If the character is ')':
                   Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result
                   Pop the sign and previous result from the stack and update the result
                   Reset the current number to 0
               Ignore spaces

           After the loop, add the last number to the result
           Return the result
           ```

                stack = []
                # Initialize the current number, result, and sign
                current_number = 0
                result = 0
                sign = 1
        
                # Iterate over each character in the string
                for char in s:
                    if char.isdigit():
                        # Build the current number
                        current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
                    elif char == '+':
                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                        result += sign * current_number
                        # Update the sign to positive
                        sign = 1
                        # Reset the current number
                        current_number = 0
                    elif char == '-':
                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                        result += sign * current_number
                        # Update the sign to negative
                        sign = -1
                        # Reset the current number
                        current_number = 0
                    elif char == '(':
                        # Push the current result and sign onto the stack
                        stack.append(result)
                        stack.append(sign)
                        # Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression
                        result = 0
                        sign = 1
                    elif char == ')':
                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                        result += sign * current_number
                        # Pop the sign and previous result from the stack
                        result *= stack.pop()  # this is the sign
                        result += stack.pop()  # this is the previous result
                        # Reset the current number
                        current_number = 0
        
                # Add the last number to the result
                result += sign * current_number
                return result
        ```

        This solution uses a stack to manage the results and signs, processes each character in the string, and correctly handles parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.

   We need to create a function that checks if a given string can be interpreted as an integer. If the string represents an integer, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To determine if a string represents an integer, we can try to convert the string to an integer using Python's built-in `int()` function. If the conversion is successful, the string is a valid integer representation, and we return `True`. If the conversion raises a `ValueError`, the string is not a valid integer, and we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function check_integer(s):
       Try to convert s to an integer:
