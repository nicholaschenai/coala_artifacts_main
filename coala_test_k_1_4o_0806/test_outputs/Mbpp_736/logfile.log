INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/736 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that finds the position in a sorted list where a given value can be inserted while maintaining the list's sorted order. This position should be the leftmost position where the value can be inserted.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through the list from the beginning to the end.
   - For each element in the list, we will check if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value.
   - If we find such an element, the current index is the left insertion point for the specified value.
   - If we reach the end of the list without finding such an element, the insertion point is at the end of the list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function left_insertion(sorted_list, value):
       for index from 0 to length of sorted_list - 1:
           if sorted_list[index] >= value:
               return index
       return length of sorted_list
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def left_insertion(sorted_list, value):
    # Iterate over each index and element in the sorted list
    for index in range(len(sorted_list)):
        # If the current element is greater than or equal to the value
        if sorted_list[index] >= value:
            # Return the current index as the insertion point
            return index
    # If no such element is found, return the length of the list
    # indicating the value should be inserted at the end
    return len(sorted_list)
```

This function will correctly find the leftmost insertion point for a given value in a sorted list.

    Example:


    Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]

    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, we were tasked with finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) for paths in a tree from a root vertex to every other vertex. The core concepts involved include tree traversal, pathfinding in trees, and efficient LIS calculation using dynamic programming with binary search.

    ### Key Concepts and Strategies

    1. **Tree Representation**: The tree was represented using an adjacency list, which is efficient for traversal operations like DFS or BFS. This representation is crucial for efficiently finding paths in a tree structure.

    2. **Pathfinding in Trees**: Since the graph is a tree, the shortest path from the root to any vertex is unique. We used Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and maintain the path from the root to each vertex.

    3. **LIS Calculation**: The LIS was calculated using a dynamic programming approach with binary search, which is efficient with a time complexity of `O(L log L)`, where `L` is the length of the sequence. This method involves maintaining a list that stores the smallest possible end elements of increasing subsequences of different lengths.

    ### Challenges and Solutions

    - **Input Handling**: Initially, the code did not execute because the `main()` function was not called. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by explicitly calling `main()` at the end of the script.

    - **Output Format**: Ensuring the output was printed correctly, with each LIS length on a new line, was crucial for passing the tests.

    ### Code Snippet

    Here's the core function for calculating the LIS, which was central to solving the problem:

    ```python
    def calculate_lis(sequence):
        if not sequence:
            return 0
    
        lis = []
        for value in sequence:
            low, high = 0, len(lis)
            while low < high:
                mid = (low + high) // 2
                if lis[mid] < value:
                    low = mid + 1
                else:
                    high = mid
            if low == len(lis):
                lis.append(value)
            else:
                lis[low] = value
    
        return len(lis)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of efficient data structures and algorithms for pathfinding and subsequence problems, especially in large datasets.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/736 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that finds the position where a given value should be inserted in a sorted list to maintain the order. This position is known as the "left insertion point," which is the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the specified value.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the left insertion point, we can iterate through the list and compare each element with the specified value. As soon as we find an element that is greater than or equal to the specified value, we return its index. If no such element is found, the value should be inserted at the end of the list, so we return the length of the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function left_insertion(arr, value):
       for each index i in arr:
           if arr[i] is greater than or equal to value:
               return i
