    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that finds the position where a given value should be inserted in a sorted list to maintain the order. This position is known as the \"left insertion point,\" which is the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the specified value.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the left insertion point, we can iterate through the list and compare each element with the specified value. As soon as we find an element that is greater than or equal to the specified value, we return its index. If no such element is found, the value should be inserted at the end of the list, so we return the length of the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function left_insertion(arr, value):\n       for each index i in arr:\n           if arr[i] is greater than or equal to value:\n               return i\n       return length of arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef left_insertion(arr, value):\n    # Iterate over each element in the array\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Check if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value\n        if arr[i] >= value:\n            # Return the current index as the left insertion point\n            return i\n    # If no element is greater than or equal to the value, return the length of the array\n    return len(arr)\n```\n\nThis function will correctly find the left insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list.",
