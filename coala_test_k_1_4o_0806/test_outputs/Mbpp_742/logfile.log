INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/742 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the surface area of a regular tetrahedron given the length of its edge. A regular tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four equilateral triangular faces.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Geometry**: A regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangular faces. If the edge length of the tetrahedron is `a`, then each face is an equilateral triangle with side length `a`.

2. **Area of an Equilateral Triangle**: The area \( A \) of an equilateral triangle with side length \( a \) is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times a^2
   \]

3. **Surface Area of the Tetrahedron**: Since a regular tetrahedron has four identical equilateral triangular faces, the total surface area \( S \) is:
   \[
   S = 4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times a^2 = \sqrt{3} \times a^2
   \]

4. **Implement the Formula**: Use the formula for the surface area of a tetrahedron to compute the result given the edge length.

### Pseudocode

```
function area_tetrahedron(a):
    # Calculate the area of one equilateral triangle face
    area_of_one_face = (sqrt(3) / 4) * a^2
    
    # Calculate the total surface area of the tetrahedron
    total_surface_area = 4 * area_of_one_face
    
    # Return the total surface area
    return total_surface_area
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def area_tetrahedron(a: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the area of one equilateral triangle face
    area_of_one_face = (3**0.5 / 4) * a**2
    
    # Calculate the total surface area of the tetrahedron
    total_surface_area = 4 * area_of_one_face
    
    # Return the total surface area
    return total_surface_area
```

This function calculates the surface area of a regular tetrahedron by first determining the area of one of its equilateral triangular faces and then multiplying by four to get the total surface area.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), the core concepts involved understanding the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \( a \) and \( b \) given these constraints.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).
    - **Area Formula**: The area \( S \) is given by \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \).

    ### Strategy:
    - **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \( a \).
    - **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.
    - **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.
    - **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.
    - **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    import sys
    import math

    def find_triangle_sides():
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            H = int(data[index])
            S = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            if 2 * S > H * H:
                results.append("-1")
                continue
        
            try:
                discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S
                if discriminant < 0:
                    results.append("-1")
                    continue
            
                a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
                a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
            
                b1 = 2 * S / a1
                b2 = 2 * S / a2
            
                if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:
                    results.append(f"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:
                    results.append(f"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                else:
                    results.append("-1")
            except ValueError:
                results.append("-1")
    
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation and precision handling in computational geometry problems.

   We need to write a function that calculates the surface area of a regular tetrahedron given the length of its edge. The function should return the calculated area.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   A regular tetrahedron is a three-dimensional shape with four equilateral triangular faces. To find the surface area of a regular tetrahedron, we need to calculate the area of one of its equilateral triangular faces and then multiply that by four (since there are four faces). The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length \( a \) is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times a^2\). Therefore, the surface area of a regular tetrahedron is \(4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times a^2 = \sqrt{3} \times a^2\).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function area_tetrahedron(edge_length):
       Calculate the area of one equilateral triangle face using the formula: (sqrt(3) / 4) * edge_length^2
       Multiply the area of one face by 4 to get the total surface area of the tetrahedron
       Return the total surface area
