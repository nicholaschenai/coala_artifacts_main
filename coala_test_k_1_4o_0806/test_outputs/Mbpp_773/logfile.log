INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/773 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that finds the first occurrence of a given substring within a larger string. The function should return a tuple containing the substring, the starting index of the substring, and the ending index of the substring. If the substring is not found, the function should return `None`.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Substring**: Use Python's string method to find the first occurrence of the substring within the main string.
2. **Determine Indices**: If the substring is found, calculate the starting and ending indices of the substring.
3. **Return Result**: Return a tuple with the substring and its indices. If the substring is not found, return `None`.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `occurance_substring` that takes two parameters: `main_string` and `substring`.
2. Use the `find` method of the string to get the starting index of the `substring` in `main_string`.
3. If the starting index is `-1`, return `None` (indicating the substring is not found).
4. Otherwise, calculate the ending index as the starting index plus the length of the substring.
5. Return a tuple containing the substring, the starting index, and the ending index.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def occurance_substring(main_string: str, substring: str):
    # Find the starting index of the substring in the main string
    start_index = main_string.find(substring)
    
    # If the substring is not found, return None
    if start_index == -1:
        return None
    
    # Calculate the ending index of the substring
    end_index = start_index + len(substring)
    
    # Return the tuple with the substring and its indices
    return (substring, start_index, end_index)
```

This solution uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is found, it calculates the ending index by adding the length of the substring to the starting index. The function then returns the required tuple. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem and the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

    1. **Problem Understanding and Approach:**
       - The problem requires finding the shortest superstring that contains all given strings as substrings. The challenge is to efficiently merge strings by maximizing overlaps.
       - My initial approach used dynamic programming to track overlaps and reconstruct the superstring, which is a valid strategy but can be complex to implement correctly.

    2. **Official Solution Insights:**
       - The official solution uses a memoization technique to optimize the recursive calculation of the shortest superstring. This is a powerful approach to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
       - The `merge` function is used to concatenate two strings with the maximum possible overlap, which is a crucial step in minimizing the length of the superstring.
       - The `find_short` function recursively finds the shortest superstring for a given subset of strings, using memoization to store and reuse results.

    3. **Key Differences and Improvements:**
       - The official solution simplifies the problem by using a recursive approach with memoization, which can be more intuitive and easier to manage than a full dynamic programming table.
       - The use of a decorator for memoization (`@memo`) is a neat way to cache results of recursive calls, reducing the need for manual management of a DP table.
       - The solution also includes a preprocessing step to remove any string that is a substring of another, which simplifies the problem space.

    4. **Learning Points:**
       - Memoization can be a powerful tool in recursive solutions, especially when dealing with overlapping subproblems.
       - Simplifying the problem space by removing unnecessary elements (e.g., substrings) can lead to more efficient solutions.
       - The official solution's use of Python's functional programming features (like decorators) can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.

    Overall, the official solution provides a more elegant and efficient approach to solving the problem, leveraging memoization and recursive strategies effectively. This experience highlights the importance of considering different algorithmic techniques and the potential benefits of simplifying the problem space before diving into complex implementations.
