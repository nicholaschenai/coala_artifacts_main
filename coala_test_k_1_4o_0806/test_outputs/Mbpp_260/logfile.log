INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the nth Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams (NSW) prime number. The NSW prime numbers are a sequence of numbers defined by a specific recurrence relation. The task is to find the nth number in this sequence.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Sequence**: The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime numbers are defined by the recurrence relation:
   - \( S_0 = 1 \)
   - \( S_1 = 1 \)
   - \( S_n = 2 \times S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

2. **Generate the Sequence**: To find the nth NSW prime, we need to generate the sequence up to the nth term using the recurrence relation.

3. **Return the nth Term**: Once the sequence is generated up to the nth term, return the nth term as the result.

## Pseudocode

```
function newman_prime(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    initialize S0 = 1
    initialize S1 = 1
    for i from 2 to n:
        calculate Si = 2 * S1 + S0
        update S0 = S1
        update S1 = Si
    return Si
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def newman_prime(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases for the sequence
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first two terms of the sequence
    S0 = 1
    S1 = 1
    
    # Calculate the sequence up to the nth term
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Calculate the next term using the recurrence relation
        Si = 2 * S1 + S0
        # Update the previous terms for the next iteration
        S0 = S1
        S1 = Si
    
    # Return the nth term
    return Si
```

This code correctly implements the recurrence relation for the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams sequence and returns the nth term, which is the desired result.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.

    ### Strategy:
    - I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.
    - This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).

    ### Implementation:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/260 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the nth number in the Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams (NSW) prime sequence. The sequence is defined by a specific recurrence relation, and we need to compute the nth term of this sequence.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Newmanâ€“Shanksâ€“Williams prime sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
   - NSW(0) = 1
   - NSW(1) = 1
   - NSW(n) = 2 * NSW(n-1) + NSW(n-2) for n > 1

   To find the nth term, we can use this recurrence relation to compute each term starting from the base cases until we reach the nth term.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function newman_prime(n):
       If n is 0 or 1:
           Return 1
       Initialize two variables a and b to 1 (NSW(0) and NSW(1))
       For i from 2 to n:
           Calculate the next term using the formula: next_term = 2 * b + a
           Update a to b
           Update b to next_term
       Return b
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def newman_prime(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases for the sequence
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
