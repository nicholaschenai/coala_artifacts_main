    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the nth number in the Newman\u2013Shanks\u2013Williams (NSW) prime sequence. The sequence is defined by a specific recurrence relation, and we need to compute the nth term of this sequence.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The Newman\u2013Shanks\u2013Williams prime sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:\n   - NSW(0) = 1\n   - NSW(1) = 1\n   - NSW(n) = 2 * NSW(n-1) + NSW(n-2) for n > 1\n\n   To find the nth term, we can use this recurrence relation to compute each term starting from the base cases until we reach the nth term.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function newman_prime(n):\n       If n is 0 or 1:\n           Return 1\n       Initialize two variables a and b to 1 (NSW(0) and NSW(1))\n       For i from 2 to n:\n           Calculate the next term using the formula: next_term = 2 * b + a\n           Update a to b\n           Update b to next_term\n       Return b\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef newman_prime(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base cases for the sequence\n    if n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two terms of the sequence\n    a, b = 1, 1\n    \n    # Compute the sequence up to the nth term\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the next term using the recurrence relation\n        next_term = 2 * b + a\n        # Update the previous two terms\n        a, b = b, next_term\n    \n    # Return the nth term\n    return b\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the recurrence relation for the Newman\u2013Shanks\u2013Williams sequence and computes the nth term efficiently.",
