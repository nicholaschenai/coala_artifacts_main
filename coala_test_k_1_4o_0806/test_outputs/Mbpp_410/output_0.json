    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list containing both strings and integers and returns the smallest integer from that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list and check each element to see if it is an integer. If it is, we will compare it to the current minimum integer found so far. We will initialize the minimum integer with a very large value to ensure that any integer in the list will be smaller. At the end of the iteration, we will return the smallest integer found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function min_val that takes a list as input\n       Initialize min_value to a very large number\n       For each element in the list\n           If the element is an integer\n               If the element is less than min_value\n                   Update min_value to be the element\n       Return min_value\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef min_val(lst):\n    # Initialize min_value to a very large number\n    min_value = float('inf')\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # Check if the element is an integer\n        if isinstance(element, int):\n            # If the element is less than the current min_value, update min_value\n            if element < min_value:\n                min_value = element\n    \n    # Return the smallest integer found\n    return min_value\n```",
