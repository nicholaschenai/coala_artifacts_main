    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine if a list of integers contains any duplicate values. If there are duplicates, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a set to track the integers we have already seen as we iterate through the list. Sets are useful here because they automatically handle duplicates. As we go through each number in the list, we check if it is already in the set. If it is, we have found a duplicate and can return `True`. If it is not, we add the number to the set and continue. If we finish checking all numbers without finding any duplicates, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty set called seen_numbers\n   For each number in the list:\n       If the number is in seen_numbers:\n           Return True (a duplicate is found)\n       Else:\n           Add the number to seen_numbers\n   Return False (no duplicates found)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef test_duplicate(arr):\n    # Initialize an empty set to keep track of seen numbers\n    seen_numbers = set()\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        # Check if the number is already in the set\n        if number in seen_numbers:\n            # If it is, we found a duplicate, return True\n            return True\n        else:\n            # If not, add the number to the set\n            seen_numbers.add(number)\n    \n    # If no duplicates were found, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently checks for duplicates by leveraging the properties of a set, which provides average O(1) time complexity for both insertions and membership checks.",
