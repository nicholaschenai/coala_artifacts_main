If there are duplicates, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To find duplicates in a list, we can use a set to track the numbers we have already seen. As we iterate through the list, we check if the current number is already in the set. If it is, we have found a duplicate and return `True`. If it is not, we add the number to the set and continue. If we finish iterating through the list without finding any duplicates, we return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function test_duplicate(arr):\n       create an empty set called seen_numbers\n       for each number in arr:\n           if number is in seen_numbers:\n               return True\n           else:\n               add number to seen_numbers\n       return False\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef test_duplicate(arr):\n    # Create an empty set to keep track of numbers we have seen\n    seen_numbers = set()\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the array\n    for number in arr:\n        # If the number is already in the set, we found a duplicate\n        if number in seen_numbers:\n            return True\n        # Otherwise, add the number to the set\n        else:\n            seen_numbers.add(number)\n    \n    # If we finish the loop without finding duplicates, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently checks for duplicates by leveraging the properties of a set, which allows for average O(1) time complexity for both membership checks and insertions."

The core concept here is understanding how the bitwise OR operation works and how it can be efficiently computed over subarrays.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Bitwise OR Properties**: The OR operation is cumulative in the sense that adding more elements to a subarray can only maintain or increase the OR result.\n    - **Set for Uniqueness**: Using a set to track results ensures that duplicates are automatically handled, which is crucial for counting unique results.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - **Dynamic Approach**: Instead of recalculating the OR for every possible subarray, maintain a set of results from the previous iteration (`prev`). For each new element, compute the OR with each element in `prev` and add the new element itself. This reduces redundant calculations.\n    - **Iterative Update**: For each element in the array, update the `prev` set with new OR results and add these to a global `results` set to track all unique OR results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    from typing import List\n\n    class Solution:\n        def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n            results = set()\n            prev = set()\n        \n            for x in A:\n                current = {x}\n                for y in prev:\n                    current.add(x | y)\n                prev = current\n                results.update(current)\n        \n            return len(results)\n    ```\n\n    This approach efficiently computes the number of unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to manage unique results. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
