The function should count how many times the elements from the list appear in the tuple and return that count.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - Iterate over each element in the tuple.\n   - For each element in the tuple, check if it is present in the list.\n   - If it is present, increment the counter by one.\n   - After iterating through the entire tuple, return the counter as the result.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function count_Occurrence(input_tuple, input_list):\n       initialize counter to 0\n       for each element in input_tuple:\n           if element is in input_list:\n               increment counter by 1\n       return counter\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_Occurrence(input_tuple: tuple, input_list: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences\n    counter = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the tuple\n    for element in input_tuple:\n        # Check if the current element is in the list\n        if element in input_list:\n            # Increment the counter if the element is found in the list\n            counter += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return counter\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of times elements from the list appear in the tuple and return that count."

The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.\n    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.\n    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.\n    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n            prefix_sums = {0: 1}\n            current_sum = 0\n            count = 0\n        \n            for num in nums:\n                current_sum += num\n                needed_sum = current_sum - k\n                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]\n                if current_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1\n                else:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1\n        \n            return count\n    ```\n\n    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
