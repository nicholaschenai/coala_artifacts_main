    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts how many times elements from a given list appear in a given tuple. The function should return the total count of these occurrences.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each element in the tuple.\n   - For each element in the tuple, we will check if it is present in the list.\n   - If it is present, we will increase our count by one.\n   - Finally, we will return the total count of occurrences.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter to 0\n   For each element in the tuple:\n       If the element is in the list:\n           Increment the counter by 1\n   Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_Occurrence(tup: tuple, lst: list) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the tuple\n    for element in tup:\n        # Check if the current element is in the list\n        if element in lst:\n            # Increment the counter if the element is found in the list\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of times elements from the list appear in the tuple and return that count.",
