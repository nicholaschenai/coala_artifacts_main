INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/750 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the original list followed by all the elements of the tuple.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The task is to combine the elements of a tuple with a list. In Python, we can achieve this by converting the tuple into a list and then concatenating it with the original list. This will result in a new list that contains all the elements from both the original list and the tuple.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `add_tuple` that takes two parameters: a list and a tuple.
   - Convert the tuple into a list.
   - Concatenate the list version of the tuple to the original list.
   - Return the concatenated list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def add_tuple(lst: list, tpl: tuple) -> list:
    # Convert the tuple to a list
    tuple_as_list = list(tpl)
    # Concatenate the list with the converted tuple list
    result = lst + tuple_as_list
    # Return the resulting list
    return result
```

This function will take a list and a tuple, convert the tuple to a list, concatenate it with the original list, and return the combined list.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this pattern generation task, I encountered a few key insights:

    1. **Pattern Understanding**: The main challenge was correctly understanding the pattern generation logic. The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.

    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.

    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.

    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:
    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.
    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.
    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. 

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.
