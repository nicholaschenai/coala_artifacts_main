A divisor is a number that divides another number completely without leaving a remainder.\n\n### Conceptualizing the Solution\n\nTo find the number of divisors of a given integer `n`:\n1. Initialize a counter to zero.\n2. Iterate through all integers from 1 to `n`.\n3. For each integer `i`, check if it divides `n` without leaving a remainder (i.e., `n % i == 0`).\n4. If it does, increment the counter.\n5. After checking all numbers, the counter will hold the total number of divisors of `n`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction divisor(n):\n    initialize count to 0\n    for i from 1 to n (inclusive):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            increment count\n    return count\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the count of divisors to 0\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # Increment the count if i is a divisor\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of divisors\n    return count\n```"

The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\n    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.\n\n    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. \n\n    Here is the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            steps = 0\n            while n != 1:\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    n //= 2\n                else:\n                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                        n -= 1\n                    else:\n                        n += 1\n                steps += 1\n            return steps\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
