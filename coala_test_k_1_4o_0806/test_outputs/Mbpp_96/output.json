    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the number of divisors of a given integer. A divisor is a number that divides the integer without leaving a remainder.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the number of divisors of a given integer `n`, we can iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` and check if each number divides `n` without leaving a remainder. If it does, it is a divisor, and we count it. The total count at the end of the iteration will be the number of divisors of `n`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function divisor(n):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each number i from 1 to n:\n           if n is divisible by i (n % i == 0):\n               increment count by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef divisor(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of divisors\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each number from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if i is a divisor of n\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If it is, increment the count\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of divisors\n    return count\n```\n\nThis function will correctly calculate the number of divisors for any given integer `n` by checking each number from 1 to `n` to see if it divides `n` without a remainder.",
