    "raw_msg": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as a sum of distinct non-zero powers of 2. In other words, we need to check if the number can be represented using a combination of different powers of 2, where each power is used at most once.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nThe problem is essentially asking if the number can be represented in binary form using only the digits 0 and 1. This is because each digit in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2. If a number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, its binary representation will only contain the digits 0 and 1.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Convert the given number to its binary representation.\n2. Check if the binary representation contains only the digits 0 and 1.\n3. If it does, return `True` because the number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2.\n4. Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to its binary representation\n    # and check if it contains only '0' and '1'\n    # The binary representation of a number in Python starts with '0b'\n    # so we slice it off using [2:]\n    binary_representation = bin(n)[2:]\n    \n    # Check if all characters in the binary representation are either '0' or '1'\n    for char in binary_representation:\n        if char not in '01':\n            return False\n    \n    # If we only have '0' and '1', it means the number can be represented\n    # as a sum of distinct powers of 2\n    return True\n```\n\nThis code checks if the binary representation of the number consists solely of the digits '0' and '1', which confirms that the number can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2.",
