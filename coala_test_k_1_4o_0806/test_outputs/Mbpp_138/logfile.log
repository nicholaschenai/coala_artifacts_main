INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/138 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2. For example, the number 10 can be expressed as \(2^3 + 2^1\) (which is 8 + 2), so the function should return `True` for 10.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - A number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2 if its binary representation consists only of 0s and 1s. Each '1' in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2 that contributes to the sum.
   - For example, the binary representation of 10 is `1010`, which corresponds to \(2^3 + 2^1\).
   - Therefore, to solve the problem, we can convert the number to its binary form and check if it consists only of 0s and 1s. If it does, the number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n):
       if n is less than or equal to 0:
           return False
       while n is greater than 0:
           if n is odd:
               subtract 1 from n
           else:
               divide n by 2
       return True
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n: int) -> bool:
    # If the number is less than or equal to 0, it cannot be represented as a sum of positive powers of 2
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    
    # While n is greater than 0, check each bit
    while n > 0:
        # If the least significant bit is 1, it means this bit contributes to the sum
        if n % 2 == 1:
            # Subtract 1 to remove the contribution of this power of 2
            n -= 1
        # Divide n by 2 to shift right and check the next bit
        n //= 2
    
    # If we can reduce n to 0 by subtracting powers of 2, return True
    return True
```

This solution iteratively checks each bit of the number by using modulo and division operations, effectively simulating the process of checking the binary representation of the number. If the number can be reduced to zero by subtracting powers of 2, it returns `True`.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to transform an integer `n` into `0` using the minimum number of bit-flipping operations. The operations allowed were specific to the binary representation of `n`, focusing on flipping the rightmost bit or flipping a bit based on the state of preceding bits.

    The core concept here was understanding how to manipulate binary numbers efficiently. The problem required recognizing patterns in binary operations and leveraging recursive strategies to minimize operations. The recursive approach was key, as it allowed breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems by focusing on the most significant bit and the number formed by removing it.

    The solution involved:
    - Using recursion to handle the transformation of `n` to `0`.
    - Identifying the most significant bit and using it to determine the next steps.
    - Applying a formula to calculate the number of operations based on whether the most significant bit was `1` or `0`.

    This problem reinforced the importance of bit manipulation and recursive problem-solving strategies in algorithm design. The recursive approach, combined with bitwise operations, provided an efficient way to solve the problem without iterating through each bit manually.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/138 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as a sum of distinct non-zero powers of 2. In other words, we need to check if the number can be represented using a combination of different powers of 2, where each power is used at most once.

### Conceptual Solution

The problem is essentially asking if the number can be represented in binary form using only the digits 0 and 1. This is because each digit in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2. If a number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, its binary representation will only contain the digits 0 and 1.

### Pseudocode

1. Convert the given number to its binary representation.
2. Check if the binary representation contains only the digits 0 and 1.
3. If it does, return `True` because the number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2.
4. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Python Code

```python
def is_Sum_Of_Powers_Of_Two(n: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the number to its binary representation
    # and check if it contains only '0' and '1'
    # The binary representation of a number in Python starts with '0b'
    # so we slice it off using [2:]
    binary_representation = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Check if all characters in the binary representation are either '0' or '1'
    for char in binary_representation:
        if char not in '01':
            return False
    
    # If we only have '0' and '1', it means the number can be represented
    # as a sum of distinct powers of 2
    return True
```

This code checks if the binary representation of the number consists solely of the digits '0' and '1', which confirms that the number can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2.
