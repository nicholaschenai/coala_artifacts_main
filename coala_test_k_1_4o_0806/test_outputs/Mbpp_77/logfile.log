INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/77 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that checks if a given integer is divisible by 11. The function should return `True` if the number is divisible by 11 and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the divisibility rule for 11. The rule states that a number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11 (including zero). 

   Steps:
   - Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.
   - Initialize two sums: one for digits in odd positions and one for digits in even positions.
   - Iterate over the digits, adding to the appropriate sum based on the position (odd or even).
   - Calculate the absolute difference between the two sums.
   - Check if this difference is divisible by 11.
   - Return `True` if it is divisible by 11, otherwise return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function is_Diff(n):
       convert n to string
       initialize odd_sum to 0
       initialize even_sum to 0
       for each index and digit in the string representation of n:
           if index is even:
               add digit to odd_sum
           else:
               add digit to even_sum
       calculate difference = absolute value of (odd_sum - even_sum)
       if difference is divisible by 11:
           return True
       else:
           return False
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_Diff(n: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the number to a string to iterate over each digit
    n_str = str(n)
    
    # Initialize sums for odd and even positioned digits
    odd_sum = 0
    even_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over the digits with their index
    for index, digit in enumerate(n_str):
        # Convert the character to an integer
        digit_value = int(digit)
        
        # Check if the index is even or odd
        if index % 2 == 0:
            # Add to odd_sum if index is even (0-based index)
            odd_sum += digit_value
        else:
            # Add to even_sum if index is odd
            even_sum += digit_value
    
    # Calculate the absolute difference between the sums
    difference = abs(odd_sum - even_sum)
    
    # Check if the difference is divisible by 11
    return difference % 11 == 0
```

This code implements the divisibility rule for 11 and checks if the given number is divisible by 11, returning the appropriate boolean value.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.

    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.

    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. 

    Here is the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
            steps = 0
            while n != 1:
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    n //= 2
                else:
                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        n += 1
                steps += 1
            return steps
    ```
