    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given number is divisible by 11. The function should return `True` if the number is divisible by 11, and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use a mathematical rule: A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11. We will implement this rule in our function.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function is_Diff that takes an integer n as input.\n   Convert the integer n to a string to easily access each digit.\n   Initialize two variables, sum_odd and sum_even, to 0.\n   Iterate over each digit in the string representation of n:\n       If the index of the digit is even, add the digit to sum_odd.\n       If the index of the digit is odd, add the digit to sum_even.\n   Calculate the difference between sum_odd and sum_even.\n   Check if the difference is divisible by 11.\n   Return True if it is divisible by 11, otherwise return False.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_Diff(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string to access each digit\n    n_str = str(n)\n    \n    # Initialize sums for odd and even positioned digits\n    sum_odd = 0\n    sum_even = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each digit in the string representation of the number\n    for i, digit in enumerate(n_str):\n        # Convert the character to an integer\n        digit_value = int(digit)\n        \n        # Check if the index is even or odd and update the respective sum\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            sum_odd += digit_value\n        else:\n            sum_even += digit_value\n    \n    # Calculate the difference between the sums\n    difference = sum_odd - sum_even\n    \n    # Check if the difference is divisible by 11\n    return difference % 11 == 0\n```",
