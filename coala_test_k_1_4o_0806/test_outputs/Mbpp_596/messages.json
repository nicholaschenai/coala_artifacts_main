The size should be determined using Python's built-in method for measuring the size of an object in memory.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Python provides a built-in function `sys.getsizeof()` that returns the size of an object in bytes. This function includes the overhead of the object itself.\n   - We will use this function to determine the size of the input tuple.\n   - The function `tuple_size` will take a tuple as an argument and return the result of `sys.getsizeof()` applied to that tuple.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   - Import the `sys` module to access the `getsizeof` function.\n   - Define the function `tuple_size` that takes a single parameter `tup`.\n   - Inside the function, use `sys.getsizeof(tup)` to get the size of the tuple.\n   - Return the size obtained from `sys.getsizeof(tup)`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the function tuple_size\ndef tuple_size(tup: tuple) -> int:\n    # Use sys.getsizeof to get the size of the tuple in bytes\n    return sys.getsizeof(tup)\n```\n\nThis solution imports the `sys` module and defines the `tuple_size` function, which returns the size of the input tuple in bytes using `sys.getsizeof()`."

This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.\n\n    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.\n\n    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.\n\n    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
