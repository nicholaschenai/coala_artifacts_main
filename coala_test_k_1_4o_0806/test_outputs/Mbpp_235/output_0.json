    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns a new integer where all even-positioned bits (0-indexed) in the binary representation of the input number are set to 1.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to manipulate the binary representation of the given number. The task is to ensure that all bits at even positions (0, 2, 4, ...) are set to 1. We can achieve this by creating a mask where all even bits are set to 1 and then using the bitwise OR operation to set these bits in the given number.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function even_bit_set_number(n):\n       Initialize mask to 0\n       Set bit_position to 0\n       While bit_position is less than the number of bits in n:\n           Set the bit at bit_position in mask to 1\n           Increment bit_position by 2\n       Return n OR mask\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef even_bit_set_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the mask with 0\n    mask = 0\n    # Start with the 0th bit position\n    bit_position = 0\n    \n    # Loop to set all even bits in the mask\n    while bit_position < n.bit_length():\n        # Set the bit at the current even position\n        mask |= (1 << bit_position)\n        # Move to the next even bit position\n        bit_position += 2\n    \n    # Return the number with all even bits set\n    return n | mask\n```\n\nThis function creates a mask with all even bits set to 1 and then uses the bitwise OR operation to ensure that all even bits in the input number are set to 1.",
