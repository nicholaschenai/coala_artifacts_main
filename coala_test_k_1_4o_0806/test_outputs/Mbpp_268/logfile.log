INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/268 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the nth star number. A star number is a figurate number that represents a centered hexagram (a six-pointed star), like the Star of David. The nth star number can be calculated using a specific formula.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The formula to find the nth star number is given by: `Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1`. This formula calculates the number of points in a star shape for a given n. We will implement this formula in a function to compute the nth star number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `find_star_num` that takes an integer `n` as input.
   - Use the formula `Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1` to calculate the nth star number.
   - Return the result.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**

```python
def find_star_num(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth star number using the formula
    # Star(n) = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1
    star_number = 6 * n * (n - 1) + 1
    # Return the calculated star number
    return star_number
```

This function will correctly compute the nth star number using the given formula.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:

    1. **Formula Derivation**:
       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.

    2. **Handling the First Term**:
       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.

    3. **Efficiency**:
       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.

    4. **Code Simplicity**:
       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.

    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.

   We need to write a function that calculates the nth star number. A star number is a figurate number that represents a centered hexagram (a six-pointed star), like the Star of David. The sequence of star numbers starts with 1, 13, 37, 73, etc. We need to find the formula for the nth star number and implement it in a function.

   This formula arises from the geometric arrangement of the star shape. The formula calculates the number of points in the star by considering the layers of hexagons that form the star. We will implement this formula in a function to compute the nth star number.
