The task is to identify such a subsequence in the array and calculate the maximum possible sum of its elements.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Increasing Subsequences**: For each element in the array, calculate the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at that element. This can be done using dynamic programming by iterating over the array and keeping track of the maximum sum for each element.\n\n2. **Identify Decreasing Subsequences**: Similarly, for each element, calculate the maximum sum of a decreasing subsequence starting from that element. This can be done by iterating over the array in reverse order.\n\n3. **Combine Results**: For each element in the array, calculate the sum of the maximum increasing subsequence ending at that element and the maximum decreasing subsequence starting from that element, subtracting the element itself once (since it is counted in both subsequences).\n\n4. **Find Maximum Sum**: The result will be the maximum of these combined sums.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize two arrays `inc` and `dec` of the same length as the input array, filled with zeros.\n2. For each element `i` in the array:\n   - Calculate `inc[i]` as the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at `i`.\n3. For each element `i` in the array (in reverse order):\n   - Calculate `dec[i]` as the maximum sum of a decreasing subsequence starting from `i`.\n4. Initialize a variable `max_sum` to zero.\n5. For each element `i` in the array:\n   - Calculate the combined sum as `inc[i] + dec[i] - array[i]`.\n   - Update `max_sum` if this combined sum is greater than the current `max_sum`.\n6. Return `max_sum`.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef max_sum(array):\n    n = len(array)\n    \n    # Initialize arrays to store the maximum sum of increasing and decreasing subsequences\n    inc = [0] * n\n    dec = [0] * n\n    \n    # Calculate maximum sum of increasing subsequence ending at each element\n    for i in range(n):\n        inc[i] = array[i]\n        for j in range(i):\n            if array[j] < array[i]:\n                inc[i] = max(inc[i], inc[j] + array[i])\n    \n    # Calculate maximum sum of decreasing subsequence starting at each element\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        dec[i] = array[i]\n        for j in range(n-1, i, -1):\n            if array[j] < array[i]:\n                dec[i] = max(dec[i], dec[j] + array[i])\n    \n    # Find the maximum sum of bitonic subsequence\n    max_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, inc[i] + dec[i] - array[i])\n    \n    return max_sum\n```\n\nThis code follows the outlined steps to calculate the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence in the given array."

The alternating sum is calculated by adding the first element, subtracting the second, adding the third, and so on. The challenge is to select a subsequence that maximizes this sum.\n\n    #### Initial Strategy and Mistakes\n    Initially, the approach was to sort the array in descending order and calculate the alternating sum by iterating through the entire sorted list. The assumption was that using all elements would yield the maximum sum, which was incorrect. This approach failed because it did not consider that some elements might not contribute positively to the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Corrected Strategy\n    The correct strategy involves sorting the array in descending order and then calculating the alternating sum by selectively adding and subtracting elements. The key is to ensure that the sum remains positive and maximized by carefully choosing which elements to include in the subsequence. The solution should only include elements that contribute positively to the alternating sum.\n\n    #### Lessons Learned\n    - Sorting the array in descending order is crucial for maximizing the alternating sum.\n    - Not all elements need to be included in the subsequence; only those that contribute positively should be considered.\n    - The alternating sum calculation must be carefully managed to ensure that the sum remains maximized.\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of understanding the problem constraints and requirements thoroughly before implementing a solution. It also reinforced the need to consider edge cases where not all elements contribute positively to the desired outcome.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This type of subsequence is called a bitonic subsequence.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain two arrays:\n   - `inc[i]`: This will store the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.\n   - `dec[i]`: This will store the maximum sum of a decreasing subsequence starting at index `i`.\n\n   The steps are as follows:\n   - First, calculate the `inc` array by iterating from left to right. For each element, check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence ending at the current element.\n   - Then, calculate the `dec` array by iterating from right to left. For each element, check all subsequent elements to see if they can form a decreasing subsequence starting at the current element.\n   - Finally, the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence is the maximum value of `inc[i] + dec[i] - arr[i]` for all `i`, because the element at `i` is counted twice in both `inc` and `dec`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_sum(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       if n == 0:\n           return 0\n\n       inc = array of size n, initialized to 0\n       dec = array of size n, initialized to 0\n\n       # Calculate inc array\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           inc[i] = arr[i]\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   inc[i] = max(inc[i], inc[j] + arr[i])\n\n       # Calculate dec array\n       for i from n-1 to 0:\n           dec[i] = arr[i]\n           for j from n-1 to i+1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   dec[i] = max(dec[i], dec[j] + arr[i])\n\n       # Find the maximum sum of bitonic subsequence\n       max_sum = 0\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           max_sum = max(max_sum, inc[i] + dec[i] - arr[i])\n\n       return max_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_sum(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize the inc and dec arrays\n    inc = [0] * n\n    dec = [0] * n\n\n    # Calculate the inc array\n    for i in range(n):\n        inc[i] = arr[i]\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                inc[i] = max(inc[i], inc[j] + arr[i])\n\n    # Calculate the dec array\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        dec[i] = arr[i]\n        for j in range(n-1, i, -1):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                dec[i] = max(dec[i], dec[j] + arr[i])\n\n    # Find the maximum sum of bitonic subsequence\n    max_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, inc[i] + dec[i] - arr[i])\n\n    return max_sum\n```\n\nThis code calculates the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence by using dynamic programming to build up the `inc` and `dec` arrays, and then finds the maximum possible sum by combining these arrays."
