    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum sum of a subsequence from a given list of numbers, where the subsequence first increases and then decreases. This type of subsequence is called a bitonic subsequence.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain two arrays:\n   - `inc[i]`: This will store the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.\n   - `dec[i]`: This will store the maximum sum of a decreasing subsequence starting at index `i`.\n\n   The steps are as follows:\n   - First, calculate the `inc` array by iterating from left to right. For each element, check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence ending at the current element.\n   - Then, calculate the `dec` array by iterating from right to left. For each element, check all subsequent elements to see if they can form a decreasing subsequence starting at the current element.\n   - Finally, the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence is the maximum value of `inc[i] + dec[i] - arr[i]` for all `i`, because the element at `i` is counted twice in both `inc` and `dec`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_sum(arr):\n       n = length of arr\n       if n == 0:\n           return 0\n\n       inc = array of size n, initialized to 0\n       dec = array of size n, initialized to 0\n\n       # Calculate inc array\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           inc[i] = arr[i]\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   inc[i] = max(inc[i], inc[j] + arr[i])\n\n       # Calculate dec array\n       for i from n-1 to 0:\n           dec[i] = arr[i]\n           for j from n-1 to i+1:\n               if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                   dec[i] = max(dec[i], dec[j] + arr[i])\n\n       # Find the maximum sum of bitonic subsequence\n       max_sum = 0\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           max_sum = max(max_sum, inc[i] + dec[i] - arr[i])\n\n       return max_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_sum(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize the inc and dec arrays\n    inc = [0] * n\n    dec = [0] * n\n\n    # Calculate the inc array\n    for i in range(n):\n        inc[i] = arr[i]\n        for j in range(i):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                inc[i] = max(inc[i], inc[j] + arr[i])\n\n    # Calculate the dec array\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        dec[i] = arr[i]\n        for j in range(n-1, i, -1):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                dec[i] = max(dec[i], dec[j] + arr[i])\n\n    # Find the maximum sum of bitonic subsequence\n    max_sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_sum = max(max_sum, inc[i] + dec[i] - arr[i])\n\n    return max_sum\n```\n\nThis code calculates the maximum sum of a bitonic subsequence by using dynamic programming to build up the `inc` and `dec` arrays, and then finds the maximum possible sum by combining these arrays.",
