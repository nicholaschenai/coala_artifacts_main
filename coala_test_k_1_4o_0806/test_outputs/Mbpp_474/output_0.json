    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string and two characters as input. The function should replace all occurrences of the first character in the string with the second character and return the modified string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, we check if it matches the character we want to replace. If it does, we append the replacement character to a new string. If it doesn't, we append the original character. Finally, we return the new string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function replace_char(s, old_char, new_char):\n       Initialize an empty string result\n       \n       for each character in s:\n           if character is equal to old_char:\n               Append new_char to result\n           else:\n               Append character to result\n       \n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef replace_char(s: str, old_char: str, new_char: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to build the result\n    result = ''\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in s:\n        # If the current character is the one to be replaced\n        if char == old_char:\n            # Append the new character to the result\n            result += new_char\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, append the original character\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the modified string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the input string, checks each character, and constructs a new string with the specified replacements.",
