Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a string and two characters as input. The function should replace all occurrences of the second character in the string with the third character and return the modified string.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the built-in string method `replace()`. This method allows us to replace all occurrences of a specified substring with another substring. In this case, we will replace all occurrences of the second character with the third character in the given string.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n1. Define a function named `replace_char` that takes three parameters: `s` (the original string), `old_char` (the character to be replaced), and `new_char` (the character to replace with).\n2. Use the `replace()` method on the string `s` to replace all occurrences of `old_char` with `new_char`.\n3. Return the modified string.\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef replace_char(s: str, old_char: str, new_char: str) -> str:\n    # Use the replace method to replace all occurrences of old_char with new_char\n    modified_string = s.replace(old_char, new_char)\n    # Return the modified string\n    return modified_string\n```\n\nThis function will take a string and two characters as input, replace all occurrences of the second character with the third character in the string, and return the modified string."

Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string. For each character in the string:\n           - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.\n           - If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack.\n           - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.\n           - Finally, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function removeDuplicates(s, k):\n               Initialize an empty stack\n       \n               for each character in s:\n                   if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:\n                       Increment the count of the top element in the stack\n                       if count equals k:\n                           Pop the top element from the stack\n                   else:\n                       Push (character, 1) onto the stack\n       \n               Initialize result as an empty string\n               for each (character, count) in stack:\n                   Append character repeated count times to result\n       \n               return result\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n                # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n                stack = []\n        \n                # Iterate over each character in the string\n                for char in s:\n                    if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                        # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character\n                        stack[-1][1] += 1  # Increment the count of the top element\n                        if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                            # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack\n                            stack.pop()\n                    else:\n                        # If the stack is empty or the top character is different, push the current character with count 1\n                        stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n                # Reconstruct the result string from the stack\n                result = ''\n                for char, count in stack:\n                    result += char * count  # Append the character repeated 'count' times\n        \n                return result\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently manages the removal of `k` adjacent duplicates using a stack, ensuring that the operations are performed in linear time relative to the length of the string.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['\"abcd\"', 2] Output: \"abcd\"\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
