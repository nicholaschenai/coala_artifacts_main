    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the surface area of a cube given the length of one of its sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   A cube has six faces, and each face is a square. The area of one face of the cube is the side length squared. Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is six times the area of one face. To find the surface area, we multiply the square of the side length by six.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function surfacearea_cube(side_length):\n       Calculate the area of one face by squaring the side_length\n       Multiply the area of one face by 6 to get the total surface area\n       Return the total surface area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef surfacearea_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of one face of the cube\n    face_area = side_length * side_length\n    # Calculate the total surface area by multiplying the face area by 6\n    total_surface_area = 6 * face_area\n    # Return the total surface area\n    return total_surface_area\n```\n\nThis function takes the side length of a cube as input, calculates the area of one face, multiplies it by six to get the total surface area, and returns the result.",
