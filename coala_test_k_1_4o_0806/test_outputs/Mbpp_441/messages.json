The area of one face of the cube is the side length squared. Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is six times the area of one face. To find the surface area, we multiply the square of the side length by six.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `surfacearea_cube` that takes one parameter `side_length`.\n   - Calculate the area of one face by squaring the `side_length`.\n   - Multiply the area of one face by 6 to get the total surface area.\n   - Return the total surface area.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef surfacearea_cube(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area of one face of the cube\n    face_area = side_length * side_length\n    \n    # Calculate the total surface area by multiplying the face area by 6\n    total_surface_area = 6 * face_area\n    \n    # Return the total surface area\n    return total_surface_area\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the surface area of a cube given the side length, as demonstrated by the assertion `assert surfacearea_cube(5) == 150`."

The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) given these constraints.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \\( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \\).\n    - **Area Formula**: The area \\( S \\) is given by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b = S \\).\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \\( b = \\frac{2S}{a} \\) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \\( a \\).\n    - **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.\n    - **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.\n    - **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.\n    - **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    import math\n\n    def find_triangle_sides():\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            H = int(data[index])\n            S = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            if 2 * S > H * H:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n                continue\n        \n            try:\n                discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S\n                if discriminant < 0:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                    continue\n            \n                a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n                a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n            \n                b1 = 2 * S / a1\n                b2 = 2 * S / a2\n            \n                if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n            except ValueError:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n    \n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    find_triangle_sides()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation and precision handling in computational geometry problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
