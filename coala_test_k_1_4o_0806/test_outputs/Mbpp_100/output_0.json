    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the next smallest integer that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the next smallest palindrome greater than a given integer:\n   - Start with the number immediately greater than the input integer.\n   - Check if this number is a palindrome.\n   - If it is not a palindrome, increment the number by 1 and check again.\n   - Repeat this process until a palindrome is found.\n   - Return the palindrome.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function is_palindrome(number):\n       convert number to string\n       return True if string is equal to its reverse, else False\n\n   function next_smallest_palindrome(n):\n       start with n + 1 as the candidate number\n       while candidate is not a palindrome:\n           increment candidate by 1\n       return candidate\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    str_num = str(number)\n    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse\n    return str_num == str_num[::-1]\n\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(n: int) -> int:\n    # Start with the next number after n\n    candidate = n + 1\n    # Continue until we find a palindrome\n    while not is_palindrome(candidate):\n        # Increment the candidate number\n        candidate += 1\n    # Return the palindrome found\n    return candidate\n```\n\nThis solution defines a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a number is a palindrome by comparing the string representation of the number with its reverse. The main function `next_smallest_palindrome` starts checking from `n + 1` and increments until it finds a palindrome, which it then returns.",
