A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the next smallest palindrome:\n   - Start with the number immediately greater than the given integer.\n   - Check if this number is a palindrome.\n   - If it is, return it.\n   - If not, increment the number and check again.\n   - Repeat this process until a palindrome is found.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function is_palindrome that checks if a number is a palindrome:\n       Convert the number to a string\n       Check if the string is equal to its reverse\n       Return True if they are equal, otherwise False\n\n   Define the main function next_smallest_palindrome:\n       Start with the number one greater than the input number\n       While True:\n           Check if the current number is a palindrome using is_palindrome\n           If it is, return the current number\n           Otherwise, increment the current number by 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    s = str(n)\n    # Check if the string is equal to its reverse\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef next_smallest_palindrome(n: int) -> int:\n    # Start with the number immediately greater than n\n    n += 1\n    # Continuously check for the next palindrome\n    while True:\n        # Check if the current number is a palindrome\n        if is_palindrome(n):\n            # If it is, return the number\n            return n\n        # Otherwise, increment the number and check again\n        n += 1\n```\n\nThis solution defines a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a number is a palindrome and uses it in the main function `next_smallest_palindrome` to find the next smallest palindrome greater than the given integer."

The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\n    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.\n\n    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. \n\n    Here is the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            steps = 0\n            while n != 1:\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    n //= 2\n                else:\n                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                        n -= 1\n                    else:\n                        n += 1\n                steps += 1\n            return steps\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
