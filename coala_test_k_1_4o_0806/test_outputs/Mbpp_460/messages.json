The depth is the number of runs, you have to do.\n        - In every run you have to switch the direction. First run from left, next run from right. Next left...\n        Every run has these rules:\n        - You start at the first number (from the direction).\n        - Take for every number x the remainder of the division by the number of still available elements (from \n          this position!) to have the number for the next decision.\n        - If the remainder-value is smaller than 3, take this number x (NOT the remainder-Value) direct\n          for the new array and continue with the next number.\n        - If the remainder-value (e.g. 3) is greater than 2, take the next remainder-value-number (e.g. 3)\n          elements/numbers (inclusive the number x, NOT the remainder-value) as a sub-array in the new array.\n          Continue with the next number/element AFTER this taken elements/numbers.\n        - Every sub-array in the array is independent and is only one element for the progress on the array. \n          For every sub-array you have to follow the same rules for unflatten it.\n          The direction is always the same as the actual run.\n        ```\n\n        Sounds complicated? Yeah, thats why, this is the harder version...\n        Maybe an example will help.\n\n        ```\n         Array: [4, 5, 1, 7, 1] Depth: 2 -> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n \n        Steps: \n        First run: (start from left side!)\n        1. The first number is 4. The number is smaller than the number of remaining elements, so it is the remainder-value (4 / 5 -> remainder 4).\n           So 4 numbers (4, 5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the new array.\n        2. The next number is 1. It is smaller than 3, so the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n        Now we have --> [[4, 5, 1, 7], 1]\n\n        Second run: (start from right side!)\n        1. The last number (first from other side) is 1. So the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n        2. The next element is the sub-array. So we use the rules for this.\n        2a.The last number is 7. There are 4 elements in the array. So for the next decision you have to\n           take the remainder from 7 / 4 -> 3. So 3 numbers (5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the \n           new array.\n        2b.Now there is the 4 and only one element last in this array. 4 / 1 -> remainder 0. It is smaller\n           than 3. So the 4 is added direct to the new array.\n        Now we have --> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n        ```\n\n        The given array will always contain numbers. There will only be numbers > 0.\n\n\n        Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) \n\n        I have created other katas.

The transformation process involves multiple runs, alternating the direction of processing (left-to-right, then right-to-left, and so on). Each run involves checking each number in the list and deciding whether to include it directly or as part of a sub-array, based on the remainder of the division of the number by the count of remaining elements.\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Initialize the Process**: Start with the given list and the specified depth of transformation.\n\n        2. **Iterate Over Depth**: For each depth level, process the list in alternating directions:\n           - **Left-to-Right**: Start from the beginning of the list.\n           - **Right-to-Left**: Start from the end of the list.\n\n        3. **Process Each Element**:\n           - Calculate the remainder of the current element divided by the number of remaining elements.\n           - If the remainder is less than 3, add the element directly to the new list.\n           - If the remainder is 3 or more, create a sub-array with the next `remainder` elements and add it to the new list.\n\n        4. **Recursive Processing**: If a sub-array is created, apply the same rules recursively to the sub-array.\n\n        5. **Output the Result**: After processing all depth levels, the list should be fully transformed.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n            for each level in depth:\n                if level is even:\n                    process from left to right\n                else:\n                    process from right to left\n        \n                initialize new_array\n                while there are elements in flat_array:\n                    calculate remainder = current_element % remaining_elements\n                    if remainder < 3:\n                        add current_element to new_array\n                    else:\n                        create sub-array with next 'remainder' elements\n                        add sub-array to new_array\n                        skip 'remainder' elements in flat_array\n        \n                set flat_array to new_array for next level\n\n            return flat_array\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def process_subarray(array, direction):\n            result = []\n            i = 0 if direction == 'left' else len(array) - 1\n            step = 1 if direction == 'left' else -1\n    \n            while 0 <= i < len(array):\n                remaining_elements = len(array) - i if direction == 'left' else i + 1\n                current = array[i]\n                remainder = current % remaining_elements\n        \n                if remainder < 3:\n                    result.append(current)\n                    i += step\n                else:\n                    if direction == 'left':\n                        subarray = array[i:i + remainder]\n                        result.append(process_subarray(subarray, direction))\n                        i += remainder\n                    else:\n                        subarray = array[i - remainder + 1:i + 1]\n                        result.append(process_subarray(subarray, direction))\n                        i -= remainder\n    \n            return result\n\n        def unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n            direction = 'left'\n            for _ in range(depth):\n                flat_array = process_subarray(flat_array, direction)\n                direction = 'right' if direction == 'left' else 'left'\n    \n            return flat_array\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **process_subarray**: This helper function processes a given array in a specified direction ('left' or 'right'). It calculates the remainder for each element and decides whether to add it directly or as part of a sub-array.\n        - **unflatten**: This function manages the overall process, iterating over the specified depth and alternating the direction of processing.
