INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/784 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and finds the product of the first even number and the first odd number in the list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the First Odd and Even Numbers**: Traverse the list from the beginning. Keep track of the first even number and the first odd number encountered.
2. **Calculate the Product**: Once both the first even and the first odd numbers are found, calculate their product.
3. **Return the Product**: Return the product as the result.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize two variables, `first_even` and `first_odd`, to `None`.
2. Loop through each number in the list:
   - If `first_even` is `None` and the number is even, set `first_even` to this number.
   - If `first_odd` is `None` and the number is odd, set `first_odd` to this number.
   - If both `first_even` and `first_odd` are not `None`, break the loop.
3. Calculate the product of `first_even` and `first_odd`.
4. Return the product.

### Python Code

```python
def mul_even_odd(lst):
    # Initialize variables to store the first even and odd numbers
    first_even = None
    first_odd = None
    
    # Iterate over the list to find the first even and odd numbers
    for num in lst:
        # Check if the number is even and first_even is not yet set
        if first_even is None and num % 2 == 0:
            first_even = num
        # Check if the number is odd and first_odd is not yet set
        if first_odd is None and num % 2 != 0:
            first_odd = num
        # If both first_even and first_odd are found, break the loop
        if first_even is not None and first_odd is not None:
            break
    
    # Calculate and return the product of the first even and odd numbers
    return first_even * first_odd
```

This code will correctly find the first even and odd numbers in the list and return their product, as required by the problem statement.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this pattern generation task, I encountered a few key insights:

    1. **Pattern Understanding**: The main challenge was correctly understanding the pattern generation logic. The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.

    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.

    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.

    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:
    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.
    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.
    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. 

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/784 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and finds the first even number and the first odd number in the list. The function should then return the product of these two numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Initialize two variables to store the first even and first odd numbers, setting them to `None` initially.
   - Iterate through the list of numbers.
   - For each number, check if it is even and if we haven't already found an even number. If so, store it as the first even number.
   - Similarly, check if the number is odd and if we haven't already found an odd number. If so, store it as the first odd number.
   - Once both the first even and first odd numbers are found, calculate their product and return it.
   - If the list does not contain both an even and an odd number, handle this case appropriately (though the problem does not specify what to do in this case, we assume the input will always have at least one even and one odd number).

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function mul_even_odd(numbers):
       first_even = None
       first_odd = None
       
       for number in numbers:
           if number is even and first_even is None:
               first_even = number
