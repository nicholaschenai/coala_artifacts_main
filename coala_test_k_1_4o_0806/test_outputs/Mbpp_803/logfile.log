We need to determine if a given integer is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 4 is a perfect square because it is 2 squared, and 9 is a perfect square because it is 3 squared.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Input and Output**: The function will take an integer as input and return a boolean value. The boolean will be `True` if the number is a perfect square and `False` otherwise.

2. **Determine if a Number is a Perfect Square**:
   - Calculate the integer square root of the number. This can be done by taking the square root of the number and converting it to an integer.
   - Square the integer square root and check if it equals the original number.
   - If it does, the number is a perfect square; otherwise, it is not.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_perfect_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    integer_sqrt = integer part of the square root of n
    if integer_sqrt * integer_sqrt == n:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:
    # Negative numbers cannot be perfect squares
    if n < 0:
        return False
    
    # Calculate the integer square root
    integer_sqrt = int(n ** 0.5)
    
    # Check if the square of the integer square root equals the original number
    return integer_sqrt * integer_sqrt == n
```

This solution checks if a number is a perfect square by comparing the square of its integer square root to the original number. If they are equal, the number is a perfect square.

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the key concept was identifying the use of perfect squares to determine how many rooms can be completely tiled using tiles from boxes. Each box `i` contains `i` tiles, and only perfect squares can be used to tile rooms completely, as they match the area of the rooms exactly.

    The strategy that worked was calculating the number of perfect squares up to `N` for each test case. This is efficiently done by finding the integer square root of `N`, which gives the largest integer `k` such that `k^2 <= N`. This approach is optimal because it directly leverages the mathematical properties of perfect squares, avoiding unnecessary computations.

    The implementation involved reading input, calculating the integer square root using `math.isqrt(N)`, and outputting the results. This method was straightforward and efficient, handling the constraints well, especially given the large possible value of `N` (up to `10^12`). The use of `math.isqrt` ensures that the solution is both accurate and fast, as it avoids floating-point operations. Overall, the problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and leveraging built-in functions for efficient computation.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/803 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine if a given integer is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. For example, 9 is a perfect square because it is 3 squared (3 * 3).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To check if a number is a perfect square, we can take the square root of the number and check if the result is an integer. If the square root is an integer, then the number is a perfect square. Otherwise, it is not. We can achieve this by calculating the integer square root and then squaring it to see if we get back the original number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Function is_perfect_square(n):
       If n is less than 0:
           Return False
       Calculate the integer square root of n and store it in variable 'root'
       If 'root' squared is equal to n:
           Return True
       Else:
           Return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:
    # If the number is negative, it cannot be a perfect square
    if n < 0:
        return False
    
    # Calculate the integer square root of n
    root = int(n**0.5)
    
    # Check if the square of the root is equal to n
    return root * root == n
```

This function first checks if the number is negative, as negative numbers cannot be perfect squares. It then calculates the integer square root of the number and checks if squaring this root gives back the original number. If it does, the number is a perfect square; otherwise, it is not.
