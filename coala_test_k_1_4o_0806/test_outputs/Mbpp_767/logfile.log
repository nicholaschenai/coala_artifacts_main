INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/767 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and a target sum as input. The function should return the number of pairs of numbers in the list that add up to the target sum. Each pair should be counted only once, and the order of numbers in the pair does not matter.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through each number in the list.
   - For each number, we will check if there is another number in the list that, when added to the current number, equals the target sum.
   - We will keep track of the pairs we have already counted to avoid counting the same pair more than once.
   - We will use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number in the list, which will help us efficiently find the complement of the current number that makes up the target sum.
   - As we find valid pairs, we will increment a counter to keep track of the total number of pairs.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):
       initialize a dictionary called frequency_map
       initialize a counter called pair_count to 0
       
       for each number in numbers:
           calculate the complement as target_sum - number
           if complement is in frequency_map:
               increment pair_count by the frequency of the complement
           
           if number is not in frequency_map:
               add number to frequency_map with a count of 0
           increment the count of number in frequency_map by 1
       
       return pair_count
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):
    # Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number
    frequency_map = {}
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of valid pairs
    pair_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Calculate the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the target sum
        complement = target_sum - number
        
        # If the complement is already in the frequency map, it means we have found valid pairs
        if complement in frequency_map:
            # Increment the pair count by the number of times the complement has appeared
            pair_count += frequency_map[complement]
        
        # Update the frequency map with the current number
        if number not in frequency_map:
            frequency_map[number] = 0
        frequency_map[number] += 1
    
    # Return the total number of pairs found
    return pair_count

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.
    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.

    ### Strategy:
    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.
    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.
    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            prefix_sums = {0: 1}
            current_sum = 0
            count = 0
        
            for num in nums:
                current_sum += num
                needed_sum = current_sum - k
                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:
                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]
                if current_sum in prefix_sums:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
                else:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1
        
            return count
    ```

    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/767 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the number of pairs in a list of numbers where the sum of each pair equals a given target sum. The function should return the count of such pairs.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number we encounter as we iterate through the list. For each number in the list, we calculate the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the target sum. If this complement has been seen before (i.e., it exists in our dictionary), then we have found a pair. We add the frequency of this complement to our count of pairs. After checking for pairs, we update the dictionary to include the current number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a dictionary to keep track of number frequencies
   Initialize a variable to count pairs, set it to 0

   For each number in the list:
       Calculate the complement needed to reach the target sum
       If the complement is in the dictionary:
           Add the frequency of the complement to the pair count
       Update the dictionary with the current number's frequency

   Return the pair count
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):
    # Dictionary to store the frequency of each number
    frequency = {}
    # Variable to count the number of pairs
    pair_count = 0

    # Iterate over each number in the list
    for number in numbers:
        # Calculate the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the target sum
        complement = target_sum - number
        
        # If the complement is already in the frequency dictionary, it means we have found pairs
        if complement in frequency:
            # Add the frequency of the complement to the pair count
            pair_count += frequency[complement]
        
        # Update the frequency dictionary with the current number
        if number in frequency:
            frequency[number] += 1
        else:
            frequency[number] = 1

    # Return the total count of pairs
    return pair_count
```

This solution efficiently counts the number of pairs with a sum equal to the target by using a dictionary to track the frequency of numbers encountered so far. This approach ensures that we only need to iterate through the list once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).
