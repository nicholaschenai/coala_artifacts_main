The function should return the number of pairs of numbers in the list that add up to the target sum. Each pair should be counted only once, and the order of numbers in the pair does not matter.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate through each number in the list.\n   - For each number, we will check if there is another number in the list that, when added to the current number, equals the target sum.\n   - We will keep track of the pairs we have already counted to avoid counting the same pair more than once.\n   - We will use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number in the list, which will help us efficiently find the complement of the current number that makes up the target sum.\n   - As we find valid pairs, we will increment a counter to keep track of the total number of pairs.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):\n       initialize a dictionary called frequency_map\n       initialize a counter called pair_count to 0\n       \n       for each number in numbers:\n           calculate the complement as target_sum - number\n           if complement is in frequency_map:\n               increment pair_count by the frequency of the complement\n           \n           if number is not in frequency_map:\n               add number to frequency_map with a count of 0\n           increment the count of number in frequency_map by 1\n       \n       return pair_count\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):\n    # Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number\n    frequency_map = {}\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of valid pairs\n    pair_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Calculate the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the target sum\n        complement = target_sum - number\n        \n        # If the complement is already in the frequency map, it means we have found valid pairs\n        if complement in frequency_map:\n            # Increment the pair count by the number of times the complement has appeared\n            pair_count += frequency_map[complement]\n        \n        # Update the frequency map with the current number\n        if number not in frequency_map:\n            frequency_map[number] = 0\n        frequency_map[number] += 1\n    \n    # Return the total number of pairs found\n    return pair_count\n```"

The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.\n    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.\n    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.\n    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n            prefix_sums = {0: 1}\n            current_sum = 0\n            count = 0\n        \n            for num in nums:\n                current_sum += num\n                needed_sum = current_sum - k\n                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]\n                if current_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1\n                else:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1\n        \n            return count\n    ```\n\n    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The function should return the count of such pairs.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number we encounter as we iterate through the list. For each number in the list, we calculate the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the target sum. If this complement has been seen before (i.e., it exists in our dictionary), then we have found a pair. We add the frequency of this complement to our count of pairs. After checking for pairs, we update the dictionary to include the current number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a dictionary to keep track of number frequencies\n   Initialize a variable to count pairs, set it to 0\n\n   For each number in the list:\n       Calculate the complement needed to reach the target sum\n       If the complement is in the dictionary:\n           Add the frequency of the complement to the pair count\n       Update the dictionary with the current number's frequency\n\n   Return the pair count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef get_pairs_count(numbers, target_sum):\n    # Dictionary to store the frequency of each number\n    frequency = {}\n    # Variable to count the number of pairs\n    pair_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate over each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Calculate the complement that would sum with the current number to reach the target sum\n        complement = target_sum - number\n        \n        # If the complement is already in the frequency dictionary, it means we have found pairs\n        if complement in frequency:\n            # Add the frequency of the complement to the pair count\n            pair_count += frequency[complement]\n        \n        # Update the frequency dictionary with the current number\n        if number in frequency:\n            frequency[number] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[number] = 1\n\n    # Return the total count of pairs\n    return pair_count\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently counts the number of pairs with a sum equal to the target by using a dictionary to track the frequency of numbers encountered so far. This approach ensures that we only need to iterate through the list once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n)."
