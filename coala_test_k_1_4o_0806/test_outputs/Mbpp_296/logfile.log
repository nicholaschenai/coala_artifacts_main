INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/296 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that counts the number of inversions in an array. An inversion is a pair of elements in the array such that the first element is greater than the second element, and the first element appears before the second element in the array.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To count inversions in an array, we can use a modified merge sort algorithm. The merge sort algorithm is efficient for this task because it divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and counts inversions during the merge step. The key idea is that when merging two sorted subarrays, if an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, then all remaining elements in the left subarray form inversions with this element.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
       i = left
       j = mid + 1
       k = left
       inv_count = 0

       while i <= mid and j <= right:
           if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
               temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
               i += 1
           else:
               temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
               inv_count += (mid - i + 1)
               j += 1
           k += 1

       while i <= mid:
           temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
           i += 1
           k += 1

       while j <= right:
           temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
           j += 1
           k += 1

       for i from left to right:
           arr[i] = temp_arr[i]

       return inv_count

   function merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
       inv_count = 0
       if left < right:
           mid = (left + right) // 2
           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)
           inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)
           inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)
       return inv_count

   function get_Inv_Count(arr):
       n = length of arr
       temp_arr = array of size n
       return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, n - 1)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
    i = left    # Starting index for left subarray
    j = mid + 1 # Starting index for right subarray
    k = left    # Starting index to be sorted
    inv_count = 0

    # Conditions are checked to ensure that i doesn't exceed mid and j doesn't exceed right
    while i <= mid and j <= right:
        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
            temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            # There are mid - i inversions, because all elements left to i in the left subarray
            # are greater than arr[j]
            temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
            inv_count += (mid - i + 1)
            j += 1
        k += 1

    # Copy the remaining elements of left subarray, if any
    while i <= mid:
        temp_arr[k] = arr[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1

    # Copy the remaining elements of right subarray, if any
    while j <= right:
        temp_arr[k] = arr[j]
        j += 1
        k += 1

    # Copy the sorted subarray into Original array
    for i in range(left, right + 1):
        arr[i] = temp_arr[i]

    return inv_count

def merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
    inv_count = 0
    if left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid)
        inv_count += merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, mid + 1, right)
        inv_count += merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right)

    return inv_count

def get_Inv_Count(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    temp_arr = [0] * n
    return merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, 0, n - 1)
```

This solution uses a modified merge sort to efficiently count inversions in the array, achieving a time complexity of O(n log n).

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, the goal was to count the number of inversions in an array for multiple test cases. An inversion is defined as a pair of indices \(i, j\) such that \(i < j\) and \(arr[i] > arr[j]\). The challenge was to implement an efficient solution that could handle large arrays, given the constraints.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns

    The problem tests the understanding of inversion counting using a modified merge sort algorithm. This approach leverages the divide-and-conquer strategy to count inversions in \(O(N \log N)\) time, which is efficient for large inputs. The key insight is that during the merge step, if an element from the right subarray is smaller than an element from the left subarray, it indicates inversions equal to the number of remaining elements in the left subarray.

    ### Strategies and Fixes

    Initially, the solution logic was correct, but the script failed to produce output because the `main()` function was not called. This was a simple oversight that was fixed by adding a conditional check to call `main()` when the script is executed directly. This is a common practice in Python to ensure that the script's main logic is executed only when it is run as the main program.

    ### Code Snippet

    Here's the key part of the solution that counts inversions using merge sort:

    ```python
    def merge_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, mid, right):
        # Merging and counting inversions
        # ...

    def merge_sort_and_count(arr, temp_arr, left, right):
        # Recursive merge sort and inversion counting
        # ...

    def count_inversions(arr):
        # Initialize and call merge_sort_and_count
        # ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that the main function is executed in scripts that rely on standard input/output, especially in competitive programming and testing environments.

   We need to count the number of inversions in a given list of integers. An inversion is a pair of indices \(i, j\) such that \(i < j\) and the element at index \(i\) is greater than the element at index \(j\).

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To efficiently count inversions, we can use a modified version of the merge sort algorithm. The merge sort algorithm divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together. During the merge step, we can count the number of inversions. Specifically, if an element from the right half is smaller than an element from the left half, it means that all remaining elements in the left half form inversions with this element from the right half. This approach allows us to count inversions in \(O(N \log N)\) time.
