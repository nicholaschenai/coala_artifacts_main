INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/572 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the numbers that appear exactly once in the original list. In other words, we need to remove all numbers that have duplicates in the list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we need to determine how many times each number appears in the list.
2. **Filter Unique Numbers**: Once we have the counts, we can create a new list that includes only the numbers that appear exactly once.
3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of unique numbers.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the count of each number.
2. Iterate over each number in the input list:
   - If the number is already in the dictionary, increment its count.
   - If the number is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.
3. Initialize an empty list to store the unique numbers.
4. Iterate over the dictionary:
   - For each number with a count of 1, add it to the list of unique numbers.
5. Return the list of unique numbers.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def two_unique_nums(nums):
    # Step 1: Count occurrences of each number
    count_dict = {}
    for num in nums:
        if num in count_dict:
            count_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[num] = 1
    
    # Step 2: Filter numbers that appear exactly once
    unique_nums = []
    for num, count in count_dict.items():
        if count == 1:
            unique_nums.append(num)
    
    # Step 3: Return the list of unique numbers
    return unique_nums
```

This solution efficiently counts the occurrences of each number using a dictionary and then filters out the numbers that appear more than once. The final list contains only those numbers that are unique in the input list.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.
    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.

    ### Strategy:
    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.
    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.
    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            prefix_sums = {0: 1}
            current_sum = 0
            count = 0
        
            for num in nums:
                current_sum += num
                needed_sum = current_sum - k
                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:
                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]
                if current_sum in prefix_sums:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
                else:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1
        
            return count
    ```

    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.
