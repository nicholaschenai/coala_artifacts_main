        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the numbers that appear exactly once in the original list. In other words, we need to remove all numbers that have duplicates in the list.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Count Occurrences**: First, we need to determine how many times each number appears in the list.\n2. **Filter Unique Numbers**: Once we have the counts, we can create a new list that includes only the numbers that appear exactly once.\n3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the list of unique numbers.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the count of each number.\n2. Iterate over each number in the input list:\n   - If the number is already in the dictionary, increment its count.\n   - If the number is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.\n3. Initialize an empty list to store the unique numbers.\n4. Iterate over the dictionary:\n   - For each number with a count of 1, add it to the list of unique numbers.\n5. Return the list of unique numbers.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef two_unique_nums(nums):\n    # Step 1: Count occurrences of each number\n    count_dict = {}\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in count_dict:\n            count_dict[num] += 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[num] = 1\n    \n    # Step 2: Filter numbers that appear exactly once\n    unique_nums = []\n    for num, count in count_dict.items():\n        if count == 1:\n            unique_nums.append(num)\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the list of unique numbers\n    return unique_nums\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently counts the occurrences of each number using a dictionary and then filters out the numbers that appear more than once. The final list contains only those numbers that are unique in the input list."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.\n    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.\n    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.\n    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n            prefix_sums = {0: 1}\n            current_sum = 0\n            count = 0\n        \n            for num in nums:\n                current_sum += num\n                needed_sum = current_sum - k\n                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]\n                if current_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1\n                else:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1\n        \n            return count\n    ```\n\n    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
