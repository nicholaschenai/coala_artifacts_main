INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/127 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes two integers as input and returns their product.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The task is straightforward: multiply the two given integers and return the result. This can be done using the multiplication operator `*` in Python.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `multiply_int` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.
   - Inside the function, calculate the product of `a` and `b` using the `*` operator.
   - Return the result of the multiplication.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def multiply_int(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the product of a and b
    result = a * b
    # Return the result
    return result
```

This function will correctly multiply two integers and return the result, as required by the problem statement.

Also, here are some of your memories.
Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.
