INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/12 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to write a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) as input. Each list within the matrix represents a row. The function should sort the rows of the matrix based on the sum of the elements in each row, in ascending order.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
- For each row in the matrix, calculate the sum of its elements.
- Use these sums to sort the rows of the matrix.
- Return the matrix with its rows sorted by these sums.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

```
function sort_matrix(matrix):
    sort the matrix by the sum of each row
    return the sorted matrix
```

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def sort_matrix(matrix):
    # Sort the matrix using the sum of each row as the key
    # The sorted function will sort the rows based on the sum of their elements
    sorted_matrix = sorted(matrix, key=sum)
    return sorted_matrix
```

This solution uses Python's built-in `sorted` function, which allows us to specify a `key` function. By setting `key=sum`, we ensure that the rows are sorted based on the sum of their elements. The `sorted` function returns a new list that is sorted, which we then return as the result.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this permutation problem, there are several key insights and lessons learned:

    1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The problem involves finding a permutation of numbers that satisfies a specific sum condition. The constraints on the sum, derived from the properties of permutations, are crucial for determining if a solution is possible. The official solution effectively uses these constraints to quickly rule out impossible cases.

    2. **Efficient Input/Output Handling**: Given the large potential size of input and output, efficient handling using `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout` is necessary. This was a point of improvement in my initial solution, which was corrected in the final version.

    3. **Constructing the Permutation**: The official solution uses a systematic approach to construct the permutation by starting from a known configuration (ascending order) and making adjustments to reach the desired sum. This involves understanding the maximum and minimum possible values of the function f(P) and adjusting the permutation accordingly.

    4. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution iteratively adjusts the permutation to achieve the desired sum by swapping elements. This is a more structured approach compared to my initial attempt, which was less systematic in handling the adjustments.

    5. **Edge Cases**: Handling edge cases, such as when N is 1 or when the desired sum is exactly the minimum or maximum possible, is crucial. The official solution includes specific checks for these scenarios, ensuring robustness.

    Overall, the experience highlighted the importance of understanding problem constraints, efficient I/O handling, and systematic approaches to constructing solutions. These insights are valuable for tackling similar permutation and combinatorial problems in the future.
