INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/753 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. Each tuple contains a name and a number. The function should return a list of `k` tuples with the smallest numbers, sorted in ascending order by the numbers.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   - First, we need to sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple, which is the number.
   - After sorting, we can simply take the first `k` elements from this sorted list, as they will be the tuples with the smallest numbers.
   - Return these `k` tuples as the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function min_k with parameters tuple_list and k
       Sort the tuple_list based on the second element of each tuple
       Slice the first k elements from the sorted list
       Return the sliced list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def min_k(tuple_list, k):
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple
    sorted_list = sorted(tuple_list, key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Return the first k elements from the sorted list
    return sorted_list[:k]
```

This function will correctly return the `k` tuples with the smallest numbers from the input list, sorted in ascending order by the numbers.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the difficulty of problems based on the number of decreases in the number of contestants solving subtasks as the score increases. The challenge was to correctly sort the problems based on this difficulty measure.

    The strategy that worked involved:
    1. Parsing the input to extract scores and contestant numbers for each problem.
    2. Sorting the subtasks of each problem by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers.
    3. Using a tuple `(decrease_count, index)` to represent the difficulty, which allowed for easy sorting of problems by difficulty and index.

    A key insight was recognizing that sorting the subtasks by score simplifies the process of counting decreases in contestant numbers. This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially with the number of problems being as large as 100,000.

    The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into these steps, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt. This problem reinforced the importance of sorting and tuple-based sorting for handling complex sorting criteria.
