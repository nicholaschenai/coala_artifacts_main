    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and calculates the product of all unique numbers in that list. The function should return this product.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to identify the unique numbers in the list. We can do this by converting the list to a set, which automatically removes duplicates.\n   - Once we have the unique numbers, we need to calculate their product. We can start with an initial product of 1 and multiply each unique number to this product.\n   - Finally, return the calculated product.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function unique_product(numbers):\n       Convert the list 'numbers' to a set to get unique numbers\n       Initialize a variable 'product' to 1\n       For each number in the set of unique numbers:\n           Multiply 'product' by the number\n       Return 'product'\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef unique_product(numbers):\n    # Convert the list to a set to get unique numbers\n    unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n    \n    # Initialize the product to 1\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Multiply each unique number to the product\n    for number in unique_numbers:\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Return the final product\n    return product\n```",
