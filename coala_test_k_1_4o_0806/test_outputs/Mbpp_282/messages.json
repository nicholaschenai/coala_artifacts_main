This new list should contain the result of subtracting each element of the second list from the corresponding element of the first list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, ensure that both input lists are of the same length, as element-wise operations require this.\n   - Create an empty list to store the results.\n   - Iterate over the indices of the lists.\n   - For each index, subtract the element in the second list from the element in the first list and append the result to the results list.\n   - Return the results list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `sub_list` that takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`.\n   - Initialize an empty list called `result`.\n   - Loop over the range of the length of `list1` (or `list2` since they are the same length).\n     - For each index `i`, calculate the difference between `list1[i]` and `list2[i]`.\n     - Append this difference to `result`.\n   - Return the `result` list.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sub_list(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the subtraction\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Subtract the element in list2 from the element in list1 at the same index\n        difference = list1[i] - list2[i]\n        # Append the result to the result list\n        result.append(difference)\n    \n    # Return the list containing the element-wise differences\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly subtract the elements of the second list from the first list, element by element, and return the resulting list."

The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is used to efficiently track and extend subsequences based on their differences. The key insight was to use a dictionary to store the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index with a specific difference. This allowed for quick updates and retrievals, making the solution efficient even for larger input sizes.\n\n    The strategy involved iterating over each pair of indices `(i, j)` with `i < j`, calculating the difference `diff = A[j] - A[i]`, and updating the dictionary to reflect the longest subsequence ending at `j` with that difference. If a subsequence with the same difference already existed ending at `i`, it was extended; otherwise, a new subsequence was started.\n\n    This approach worked well, and the solution passed all test cases. The use of a dictionary to map tuples of indices and differences to subsequence lengths was crucial in achieving an efficient solution. This problem reinforced the utility of dynamic programming in solving sequence-related problems and the importance of choosing the right data structures to manage state efficiently. \n\n    Here's the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def longestArithSeqLength(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n            dp = {}\n            for j in range(1, len(A)):\n                for i in range(j):\n                    diff = A[j] - A[i]\n                    if (i, diff) in dp:\n                        dp[(j, diff)] = dp[(i, diff)] + 1\n                    else:\n                        dp[(j, diff)] = 2\n            return max(dp.values())\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
