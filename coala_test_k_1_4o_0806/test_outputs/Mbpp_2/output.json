    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes two lists (or tuples) of integers and returns a list of elements that are present in both input lists. The order of elements in the output list does not matter.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Common Elements**: We need to find elements that are present in both input lists.\n2. **Use Set Intersection**: A straightforward way to find common elements between two lists is to convert them to sets and use the intersection operation. This will give us a set of elements that are present in both lists.\n3. **Convert to List**: Since the function should return a list, we will convert the resulting set back to a list.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Convert both input lists to sets.\n2. Find the intersection of these two sets.\n3. Convert the resulting set of common elements to a list.\n4. Return the list of common elements.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef similar_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Convert both input lists to sets\n    set1 = set(list1)\n    set2 = set(list2)\n    \n    # Find the intersection of the two sets\n    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)\n    \n    # Convert the set of common elements to a list\n    return list(common_elements)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the shared elements between two lists by leveraging Python's set operations, which are optimized for such tasks.",
