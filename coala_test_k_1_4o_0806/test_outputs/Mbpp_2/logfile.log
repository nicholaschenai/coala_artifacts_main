INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/2 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes two lists as input and returns a list of elements that are common to both lists. The order of elements in the output list does not matter, and there should be no duplicates in the output.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the common elements between two lists, we can convert each list to a set. Sets in Python automatically handle duplicates and allow for efficient operations like intersection. By finding the intersection of the two sets, we can easily determine which elements are shared between the two lists. Finally, we convert the resulting set back to a list to match the expected output type.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function similar_elements that takes two lists as input
       Convert the first list to a set
       Convert the second list to a set
       Find the intersection of the two sets
       Convert the intersection set to a list
       Return the list of common elements
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    # Convert the first list to a set to remove duplicates and allow set operations
    set1 = set(list1)
    # Convert the second list to a set
    set2 = set(list2)
    # Find the intersection of the two sets to get common elements
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    # Convert the set of common elements back to a list
    return list(common_elements)
```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this pattern generation task, I encountered a few key insights:

    1. **Pattern Understanding**: The main challenge was correctly understanding the pattern generation logic. The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.

    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.

    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.

    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:
    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.
    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.
    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. 

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.

We need to write a function that takes two lists (or tuples) of integers and returns a list of elements that are present in both input lists. The order of elements in the output list does not matter.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Common Elements**: We need to find elements that are present in both input lists.
2. **Use Set Intersection**: A straightforward way to find common elements between two lists is to convert them to sets and use the intersection operation. This will give us a set of elements that are present in both lists.
3. **Convert to List**: Since the function should return a list, we will convert the resulting set back to a list.

## Pseudocode

1. Convert both input lists to sets.
2. Find the intersection of these two sets.
3. Convert the resulting set of common elements to a list.
4. Return the list of common elements.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def similar_elements(list1, list2):
    # Convert both input lists to sets
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    
    # Find the intersection of the two sets
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # Convert the set of common elements to a list
    return list(common_elements)
```

This solution efficiently finds the shared elements between two lists by leveraging Python's set operations, which are optimized for such tasks.
