    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts the number of pairs in a list of integers where the XOR of the two numbers in each pair is odd.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if the XOR of two numbers is odd, we need to understand that the XOR operation results in a binary number where each bit is the result of the XOR operation on the corresponding bits of the operands. For the XOR result to be odd, the least significant bit (LSB) must be 1. This happens when one of the numbers is odd and the other is even. Therefore, we can solve the problem by counting the number of odd and even numbers in the list and then calculating the number of pairs that can be formed by choosing one odd and one even number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):\n       initialize odd_count to 0\n       initialize even_count to 0\n       \n       for each number in arr:\n           if number is odd:\n               increment odd_count\n           else:\n               increment even_count\n       \n       return odd_count * even_count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_Odd_Pair(arr, n):\n    # Initialize counters for odd and even numbers\n    odd_count = 0\n    even_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the array to count odd and even numbers\n    for number in arr:\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n    \n    # The number of pairs with an odd XOR is the product of odd and even counts\n    return odd_count * even_count\n```",
