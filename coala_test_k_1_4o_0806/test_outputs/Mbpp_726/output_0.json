    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input. The function should return a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the output should be `(5, 35, 56, 80)`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start with an empty list to store the products.\n   - Iterate through the input tuple, stopping one element before the end.\n   - For each element, multiply it by the next element in the tuple.\n   - Append the result of each multiplication to the list.\n   - Convert the list of products to a tuple and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function multiply_elements(input_tuple):\n       initialize an empty list called products\n       for i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:\n           calculate product of input_tuple[i] and input_tuple[i+1]\n           append the product to products list\n       convert products list to a tuple\n       return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef multiply_elements(input_tuple):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the products\n    products = []\n    \n    # Iterate through the input tuple, stopping one element before the end\n    for i in range(len(input_tuple) - 1):\n        # Calculate the product of the current element and the next element\n        product = input_tuple[i] * input_tuple[i + 1]\n        # Append the product to the products list\n        products.append(product)\n    \n    # Convert the products list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(products)\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the input tuple, calculates the product of each pair of consecutive elements, and stores these products in a list. Finally, it converts the list to a tuple and returns it.",
