        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as the difference of two perfect squares. In other words, for a given integer `n`, we need to check if there exist integers `a` and `b` such that `n = a^2 - b^2`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nThe expression `a^2 - b^2` can be rewritten using the difference of squares formula: \n\n\\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \\]\n\nFor `n` to be expressed as the difference of two squares, it must be possible to find integers `a` and `b` such that the product `(a - b)(a + b)` equals `n`.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. If `n` is odd, it can always be expressed as the difference of two squares. This is because we can choose `a` and `b` such that `a - b = 1` and `a + b = n`, which are both integers.\n2. If `n` is even, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if `n` is divisible by 4. This is because for even `n`, both `a - b` and `a + b` must be even, which implies `n` must be divisible by 4.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. If `n` is odd, return `True`.\n2. If `n` is even:\n   - Check if `n` is divisible by 4.\n   - If `n` is divisible by 4, return `True`.\n   - Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n## Python Code\n\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if n is odd\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return True\n    # Check if n is even and divisible by 4\n    elif n % 4 == 0:\n        return True\n    # If n is even but not divisible by 4\n    else:\n        return False\n```"

The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.\n    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.\n    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countDivisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        i = 1\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n            i += 1\n        return count\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            A = int(data[index])\n            B = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            diff = abs(A - B)\n        \n            if diff == 0:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                results.append(countDivisors(diff))\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

In other words, we need to check if there exist two integers `x` and `y` such that `x^2 - y^2` equals the given number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The difference of two squares can be expressed as `(x + y)(x - y)`. For a number `n` to be represented as a difference of two squares, it must be possible to express `n` as a product of two integers `(a, b)` such that `a = x + y` and `b = x - y`. This is possible for all integers except those of the form `4k + 2` (where `k` is an integer). Therefore, the solution involves checking if the number is not of the form `4k + 2`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function dif_Square(n):\n       if n % 4 == 2:\n           return False\n       else:\n           return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is of the form 4k + 2\n    # If it is, it cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares\n    if n % 4 == 2:\n        return False\n    # Otherwise, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares\n    else:\n        return True\n```\n\nThis function checks if the given number `n` can be represented as the difference of two squares by verifying if it is not of the form `4k + 2`. If it is not, the function returns `True`, indicating that it can be expressed as such a difference."
