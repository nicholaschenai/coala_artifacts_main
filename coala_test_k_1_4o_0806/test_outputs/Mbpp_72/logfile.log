INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/72 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as the difference of two perfect squares. In other words, for a given integer `n`, we need to check if there exist integers `a` and `b` such that `n = a^2 - b^2`.

## Conceptual Solution

The expression `a^2 - b^2` can be rewritten using the difference of squares formula: 

\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \]

For `n` to be expressed as the difference of two squares, it must be possible to find integers `a` and `b` such that the product `(a - b)(a + b)` equals `n`.

### Key Observations:
1. If `n` is odd, it can always be expressed as the difference of two squares. This is because we can choose `a` and `b` such that `a - b = 1` and `a + b = n`, which are both integers.
2. If `n` is even, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares if and only if `n` is divisible by 4. This is because for even `n`, both `a - b` and `a + b` must be even, which implies `n` must be divisible by 4.

## Pseudocode

1. If `n` is odd, return `True`.
2. If `n` is even:
   - Check if `n` is divisible by 4.
   - If `n` is divisible by 4, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

## Python Code

```python
def dif_Square(n: int) -> bool:
    # Check if n is odd
    if n % 2 != 0:
        return True
    # Check if n is even and divisible by 4
    elif n % 4 == 0:
        return True
    # If n is even but not divisible by 4
    else:
        return False
```

Also, here are some of your memories.
Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/72 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as the difference of two perfect squares. In other words, we need to check if there exist two integers `x` and `y` such that `x^2 - y^2` equals the given number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The difference of two squares can be expressed as `(x + y)(x - y)`. For a number `n` to be represented as a difference of two squares, it must be possible to express `n` as a product of two integers `(a, b)` such that `a = x + y` and `b = x - y`. This is possible for all integers except those of the form `4k + 2` (where `k` is an integer). Therefore, the solution involves checking if the number is not of the form `4k + 2`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function dif_Square(n):
       if n % 4 == 2:
           return False
       else:
           return True

def dif_Square(n: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the number is of the form 4k + 2
    # If it is, it cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares
    if n % 4 == 2:
        return False
    # Otherwise, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares
    else:
        return True
```

This function checks if the given number `n` can be represented as the difference of two squares by verifying if it is not of the form `4k + 2`. If it is not, the function returns `True`, indicating that it can be expressed as such a difference.
