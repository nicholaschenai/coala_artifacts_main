    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine if a given integer can be expressed as the difference of two perfect squares. In other words, we need to check if there exist two integers `x` and `y` such that `x^2 - y^2` equals the given number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The difference of two squares can be expressed as `(x + y)(x - y)`. For a number `n` to be represented as a difference of two squares, it must be possible to express `n` as a product of two integers `(a, b)` such that `a = x + y` and `b = x - y`. This is possible for all integers except those of the form `4k + 2` (where `k` is an integer). Therefore, the solution involves checking if the number is not of the form `4k + 2`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function dif_Square(n):\n       if n % 4 == 2:\n           return False\n       else:\n           return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef dif_Square(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is of the form 4k + 2\n    # If it is, it cannot be expressed as the difference of two squares\n    if n % 4 == 2:\n        return False\n    # Otherwise, it can be expressed as the difference of two squares\n    else:\n        return True\n```\n\nThis function checks if the given number `n` can be represented as the difference of two squares by verifying if it is not of the form `4k + 2`. If it is not, the function returns `True`, indicating that it can be expressed as such a difference.",
