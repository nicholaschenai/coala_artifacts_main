The function should return the maximum sum for a given integer `n`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - The function `f(n)` is defined recursively. For a given `n`, it compares two values:\n     - The sum of the function applied to the integer divisions of `n` by 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n     - The value of `n` itself.\n   - The function should return the maximum of these two values.\n   - To avoid recalculating values for the same `n` multiple times, we can use memoization to store already computed results.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function get_max_sum(n):\n       Create a dictionary memo to store computed results\n\n       Define a helper function f(x):\n           If x is in memo, return memo[x]\n           If x is 0, return 0\n           Calculate sum_parts as f(x//2) + f(x//3) + f(x//4) + f(x//5)\n           Calculate result as max(sum_parts, x)\n           Store result in memo with key x\n           Return result\n\n       Return f(n)\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef get_max_sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Dictionary to store already computed results for memoization\n    memo = {}\n\n    # Helper function to compute f(x) using recursion and memoization\n    def f(x: int) -> int:\n        # If the result for x is already computed, return it\n        if x in memo:\n            return memo[x]\n        # Base case: if x is 0, the maximum sum is 0\n        if x == 0:\n            return 0\n        # Calculate the sum of f(x//2), f(x//3), f(x//4), and f(x//5)\n        sum_parts = f(x // 2) + f(x // 3) + f(x // 4) + f(x // 5)\n        # The result is the maximum of sum_parts and x itself\n        result = max(sum_parts, x)\n        # Store the result in the memo dictionary\n        memo[x] = result\n        return result\n\n    # Return the result of f(n)\n    return f(n)\n```"

Then Pick slices with size 6, finally Alice and Bob will pick slice of size 2 and 1 respectively. Total = 4 + 6.\n\n        Example 2:\n\n        Input: slices = [8,9,8,6,1,1]\n        Output: 16\n        Output: Pick pizza slice of size 8 in each turn. If you pick slice with size 9 your partners will pick slices of size 8.\n\n        Example 3:\n        Input: slices = [4,1,2,5,8,3,1,9,7]\n        Output: 21\n\n        Example 4:\n        Input: slices = [3,1,2]\n        Output: 3\n\n\u00a0\n        Constraints:\n\n        1 <= slices.length <= 500\n        slices.length % 3 == 0\n        1 <= slices[i] <= 1000\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n           We have a circular array of pizza slices, and the number of slices is a multiple of 3. You, Alice, and Bob will take turns picking slices. You pick a slice first, then Alice picks the next slice in the counter-clockwise direction, and Bob picks the next slice in the clockwise direction. The goal is to maximize the sum of the sizes of the slices you pick.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Since the array is circular, we need to consider two scenarios to avoid picking adjacent slices:\n           - Consider the array from the first slice to the second-to-last slice.\n           - Consider the array from the second slice to the last slice.\n   \n           For each scenario, use dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of slices you can pick, ensuring that you skip two slices after each pick (one for Alice and one for Bob). The final result will be the maximum of the two scenarios.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           Define a helper function maxSlices(slices, n):\n               Initialize a dp array of size len(slices) with all zeros\n               Set dp[0] to slices[0]\n               Set dp[1] to max(slices[0], slices[1])\n       \n               For i from 2 to len(slices) - 1:\n                   dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + slices[i])\n       \n               Return dp[len(slices) - 1]\n   \n           In the main function maxSizeSlices(slices):\n               Calculate n as len(slices) // 3\n               Calculate max1 as maxSlices(slices[0:len(slices)-1], n)\n               Calculate max2 as maxSlices(slices[1:len(slices)], n)\n               Return max(max1, max2)\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        from typing import List\n\n        class Solution:\n            def maxSizeSlices(self, slices: List[int]) -> int:\n                # Helper function to calculate the maximum sum of slices\n                def maxSlices(slices: List[int], n: int) -> int:\n                    # Initialize a dp array to store the maximum sum up to each slice\n                    dp = [0] * len(slices)\n                    dp[0] = slices[0]\n                    dp[1] = max(slices[0], slices[1])\n            \n                    # Fill the dp array using the recurrence relation\n                    for i in range(2, len(slices)):\n                        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + slices[i])\n            \n                    # The last element of dp contains the maximum sum for this scenario\n                    return dp[-1]\n        \n                # Calculate the number of slices you can pick\n                n = len(slices) // 3\n        \n                # Consider two scenarios to handle the circular nature of the array\n                max1 = maxSlices(slices[:-1], n)\n                max2 = maxSlices(slices[1:], n)\n        \n                # Return the maximum of the two scenarios\n                return max(max1, max2)\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the maximum sum of slices you can pick, considering the circular nature of the array and the constraints of the problem.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]] Expected output: 10 # Execution output: 12\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Failure\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
