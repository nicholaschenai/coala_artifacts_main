INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/392 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function `get_max_sum(n)` that calculates the maximum sum possible using the equation `f(n) = max((f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5)), n)`. The function should return the maximum sum for a given integer `n`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - The function `f(n)` is defined recursively. For a given `n`, it compares two values:
     - The sum of the function applied to the integer divisions of `n` by 2, 3, 4, and 5.
     - The value of `n` itself.
   - The function should return the maximum of these two values.
   - To avoid recalculating values for the same `n` multiple times, we can use memoization to store already computed results.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function get_max_sum(n):
       Create a dictionary memo to store computed results

       Define a helper function f(x):
           If x is in memo, return memo[x]
           If x is 0, return 0
           Calculate sum_parts as f(x//2) + f(x//3) + f(x//4) + f(x//5)
           Calculate result as max(sum_parts, x)
           Store result in memo with key x
           Return result

       Return f(n)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def get_max_sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Dictionary to store already computed results for memoization
    memo = {}

    # Helper function to compute f(x) using recursion and memoization
    def f(x: int) -> int:
        # If the result for x is already computed, return it
        if x in memo:
            return memo[x]
        # Base case: if x is 0, the maximum sum is 0
        if x == 0:
            return 0
        # Calculate the sum of f(x//2), f(x//3), f(x//4), and f(x//5)
        sum_parts = f(x // 2) + f(x // 3) + f(x // 4) + f(x // 5)
        # The result is the maximum of sum_parts and x itself
        result = max(sum_parts, x)
        # Store the result in the memo dictionary
        memo[x] = result
        return result

    # Return the result of f(n)
    return f(n)

    [Task]:
        There is a pizza with 3n slices of varying size, you and your friends will take slices of pizza as follows:

        You will pick any pizza slice.
        Your friend AliceÂ will pickÂ next slice in anti clockwise direction of your pick.Â 
        Your friend BobÂ willÂ pickÂ next slice in clockwise direction of your pick.
        RepeatÂ untilÂ there are no more slices of pizzas.

        Sizes of Pizza slices is represented by circular array slices in clockwise direction.
        Return the maximum possible sum of slice sizes which you can have.
Â 
        Example 1:

        Input: slices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
        Output: 10
        Explanation: Pick pizza slice of size 4, Alice and Bob will pick slices with size 3 and 5 respectively. Then Pick slices with size 6, finally Alice and Bob will pick slice of size 2 and 1 respectively. Total = 4 + 6.

        Example 2:

        Input: slices = [8,9,8,6,1,1]
        Output: 16
        Output: Pick pizza slice of size 8 in each turn. If you pick slice with size 9 your partners will pick slices of size 8.

        Example 3:
        Input: slices = [4,1,2,5,8,3,1,9,7]
        Output: 21

        Example 4:
        Input: slices = [3,1,2]
        Output: 3

Â 
        Constraints:

        1 <= slices.length <= 500
        slices.length % 3 == 0
        1 <= slices[i] <= 1000

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We have a circular array of pizza slices, and the number of slices is a multiple of 3. You, Alice, and Bob will take turns picking slices. You pick a slice first, then Alice picks the next slice in the counter-clockwise direction, and Bob picks the next slice in the clockwise direction. The goal is to maximize the sum of the sizes of the slices you pick.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Since the array is circular, we need to consider two scenarios to avoid picking adjacent slices:
           - Consider the array from the first slice to the second-to-last slice.
           - Consider the array from the second slice to the last slice.
   
           For each scenario, use dynamic programming to find the maximum sum of slices you can pick, ensuring that you skip two slices after each pick (one for Alice and one for Bob). The final result will be the maximum of the two scenarios.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Define a helper function maxSlices(slices, n):
               Initialize a dp array of size len(slices) with all zeros
               Set dp[0] to slices[0]
               Set dp[1] to max(slices[0], slices[1])
       
               For i from 2 to len(slices) - 1:
                   dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + slices[i])
       
               Return dp[len(slices) - 1]
   
           In the main function maxSizeSlices(slices):
               Calculate n as len(slices) // 3
               Calculate max1 as maxSlices(slices[0:len(slices)-1], n)
               Calculate max2 as maxSlices(slices[1:len(slices)], n)
               Return max(max1, max2)
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        from typing import List

        class Solution:
            def maxSizeSlices(self, slices: List[int]) -> int:
                # Helper function to calculate the maximum sum of slices
                def maxSlices(slices: List[int], n: int) -> int:
                    # Initialize a dp array to store the maximum sum up to each slice
                    dp = [0] * len(slices)
                    dp[0] = slices[0]
                    dp[1] = max(slices[0], slices[1])
            
                    # Fill the dp array using the recurrence relation
                    for i in range(2, len(slices)):
                        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + slices[i])
            
                    # The last element of dp contains the maximum sum for this scenario
                    return dp[-1]
        
                # Calculate the number of slices you can pick
                n = len(slices) // 3
        
                # Consider two scenarios to handle the circular nature of the array
                max1 = maxSlices(slices[:-1], n)
                max2 = maxSlices(slices[1:], n)
        
                # Return the maximum of the two scenarios
                return max(max1, max2)
        ```

        This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the maximum sum of slices you can pick, considering the circular nature of the array and the constraints of the problem.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/392 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the maximum sum possible using a recursive function `f(n)`. The function is defined as the maximum of two values: the sum of the function applied to the integer divisions of `n` by 2, 3, 4, and 5, or the number `n` itself. We need to compute this for a given integer `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The problem is a recursive one where we need to compute the maximum sum for a given number `n` using the function `f(n)`. The function `f(n)` is defined as the maximum of `n` and the sum of `f(n/2)`, `f(n/3)`, `f(n/4)`, and `f(n/5)`. To avoid redundant calculations, we can use memoization to store the results of previously computed values of `f(n)`.
