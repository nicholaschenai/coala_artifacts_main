    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the intersection of two lists of tuples, where each tuple represents a pair of numbers. The intersection should consider tuples as equal if they contain the same numbers, regardless of their order. The result should be a set of tuples, with each tuple in the result having its elements in ascending order.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Normalize Tuples**: For each tuple in both lists, sort the elements of the tuple. This ensures that tuples with the same numbers but in different orders are considered equal.\n\n2. **Convert to Sets**: Convert both lists of normalized tuples into sets. This allows us to easily find the intersection of the two sets.\n\n3. **Find Intersection**: Use set intersection to find common tuples between the two sets.\n\n4. **Return Result**: Return the intersection as a set of tuples.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `normalize_tuple` that takes a tuple and returns a sorted tuple.\n2. Define the main function `tuple_intersection` that takes two lists of tuples.\n3. Normalize each tuple in both lists using `normalize_tuple`.\n4. Convert the normalized lists into sets.\n5. Find the intersection of the two sets.\n6. Return the intersection.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef normalize_tuple(t: tuple) -> tuple:\n    # Sort the elements of the tuple to ensure consistent ordering\n    return tuple(sorted(t))\n\ndef tuple_intersection(list1: list, list2: list) -> set:\n    # Normalize each tuple in both lists\n    normalized_list1 = {normalize_tuple(t) for t in list1}\n    normalized_list2 = {normalize_tuple(t) for t in list2}\n    \n    # Find the intersection of the two sets\n    intersection = normalized_list1 & normalized_list2\n    \n    # Return the intersection as a set\n    return intersection\n```\n\n### Solution Steps in Comments\n\n- The `normalize_tuple` function sorts the elements of a tuple, ensuring that tuples with the same numbers are identical regardless of order.\n- In `tuple_intersection`, we use set comprehensions to create sets of normalized tuples from both input lists.\n- We then find the intersection of these two sets using the `&` operator.\n- Finally, we return the intersection, which is a set of tuples.",
