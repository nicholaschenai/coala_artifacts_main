    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine if a given transaction results in no profit and no loss. This means checking if the selling price is equal to the cost price.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to compare two values: the selling price and the cost price. If these two values are equal, it means there is no profit and no loss. Otherwise, there is either a profit or a loss.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function noprofit_noloss(cost_price, selling_price):\n       If cost_price is equal to selling_price:\n           Return True\n       Else:\n           Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef noprofit_noloss(cost_price: int, selling_price: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the cost price is equal to the selling price\n    # If they are equal, it means there is no profit and no loss\n    if cost_price == selling_price:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function takes two integer inputs, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating no profit and no loss, and `False` otherwise.",
