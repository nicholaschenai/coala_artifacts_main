INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/637 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if there is no profit and no loss given two amounts: the cost price and the selling price. If the selling price is equal to the cost price, it means there is no profit and no loss, and the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will compare the cost price and the selling price.
   - If the selling price is equal to the cost price, it means there is no profit and no loss, so we return `True`.
   - If the selling price is not equal to the cost price, it means there is either a profit or a loss, so we return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function noprofit_noloss(cost_price, selling_price):
       if cost_price is equal to selling_price:
           return True
       else:
           return False
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def noprofit_noloss(cost_price: int, selling_price: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the cost price is equal to the selling price
    if cost_price == selling_price:
        # If they are equal, there is no profit and no loss
        return True
    else:
        # If they are not equal, there is either a profit or a loss
        return False
```

This function takes two integer inputs, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns a boolean indicating whether there is no profit and no loss.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

        Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

        Note:Â You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

        Example 1:


        Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
        Output: 6
        Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
        Â             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

        Example 2:


        Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
        Â             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
        Â             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.


        Example 3:


        Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
        Output: 0
        Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a list where each element represents the price of a stock on a particular day. We need to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying and then selling the stock. We cannot hold more than one stock at a time, meaning we must sell the stock before buying again.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can break it down into two phases:
   
           - **First Transaction:** Calculate the maximum profit we can achieve by making one transaction up to each day.
           - **Second Transaction:** Calculate the maximum profit we can achieve by making a second transaction starting from each day to the end.
   
           We will maintain two arrays:
           - `left_profits`: where `left_profits[i]` represents the maximum profit achievable from day 0 to day i.
           - `right_profits`: where `right_profits[i]` represents the maximum profit achievable from day i to the last day.
   
           Finally, the maximum profit with at most two transactions will be the maximum value of `left_profits[i] + right_profits[i]` for all i.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Initialize left_profits and right_profits arrays with zeros
           Initialize min_price to the first price in the list
           Initialize max_price to the last price in the list

           For each day i from 1 to n-1:
               Update min_price to be the minimum of min_price and prices[i]
               Update left_profits[i] to be the maximum of left_profits[i-1] and prices[i] - min_price

           For each day i from n-2 to 0:
               Update max_price to be the maximum of max_price and prices[i]
               Update right_profits[i] to be the maximum of right_profits[i+1] and max_price - prices[i]

           Initialize max_profit to 0
           For each day i from 0 to n-1:
               Update max_profit to be the maximum of max_profit and left_profits[i] + right_profits[i]

           Return max_profit
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        from typing import List

        class Solution:
            def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
                if not prices:
                    return 0
        
                n = len(prices)
                left_profits = [0] * n
                right_profits = [0] * n
        
                # Calculate left_profits
                min_price = prices[0]
                for i in range(1, n):
                    min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
                    left_profits[i] = max(left_profits[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)
        
                # Calculate right_profits
                max_price = prices[-1]
                for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
                    max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])
                    right_profits[i] = max(right_profits[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])
        
                # Calculate the maximum profit with at most two transactions
                max_profit = 0
                for i in range(n):
                    max_profit = max(max_profit, left_profits[i] + right_profits[i])
        
                return max_profit
        ```

        This solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit by considering the best possible outcomes for up to two transactions, using dynamic programming to store intermediate results.
