        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if there is no profit and no loss given two amounts: the cost price and the selling price. If the selling price is equal to the cost price, it means there is no profit and no loss, and the function should return `True`. Otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will compare the cost price and the selling price.\n   - If the selling price is equal to the cost price, it means there is no profit and no loss, so we return `True`.\n   - If the selling price is not equal to the cost price, it means there is either a profit or a loss, so we return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function noprofit_noloss(cost_price, selling_price):\n       if cost_price is equal to selling_price:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef noprofit_noloss(cost_price: int, selling_price: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the cost price is equal to the selling price\n    if cost_price == selling_price:\n        # If they are equal, there is no profit and no loss\n        return True\n    else:\n        # If they are not equal, there is either a profit or a loss\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function takes two integer inputs, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns a boolean indicating whether there is no profit and no loss."

We need to determine the maximum profit we can achieve by making at most two transactions. A transaction consists of buying and then selling the stock. We cannot hold more than one stock at a time, meaning we must sell the stock before buying again.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can break it down into two phases:\n   \n           - **First Transaction:** Calculate the maximum profit we can achieve by making one transaction up to each day.\n           - **Second Transaction:** Calculate the maximum profit we can achieve by making a second transaction starting from each day to the end.\n   \n           We will maintain two arrays:\n           - `left_profits`: where `left_profits[i]` represents the maximum profit achievable from day 0 to day i.\n           - `right_profits`: where `right_profits[i]` represents the maximum profit achievable from day i to the last day.\n   \n           Finally, the maximum profit with at most two transactions will be the maximum value of `left_profits[i] + right_profits[i]` for all i.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           Initialize left_profits and right_profits arrays with zeros\n           Initialize min_price to the first price in the list\n           Initialize max_price to the last price in the list\n\n           For each day i from 1 to n-1:\n               Update min_price to be the minimum of min_price and prices[i]\n               Update left_profits[i] to be the maximum of left_profits[i-1] and prices[i] - min_price\n\n           For each day i from n-2 to 0:\n               Update max_price to be the maximum of max_price and prices[i]\n               Update right_profits[i] to be the maximum of right_profits[i+1] and max_price - prices[i]\n\n           Initialize max_profit to 0\n           For each day i from 0 to n-1:\n               Update max_profit to be the maximum of max_profit and left_profits[i] + right_profits[i]\n\n           Return max_profit\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        from typing import List\n\n        class Solution:\n            def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:\n                if not prices:\n                    return 0\n        \n                n = len(prices)\n                left_profits = [0] * n\n                right_profits = [0] * n\n        \n                # Calculate left_profits\n                min_price = prices[0]\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])\n                    left_profits[i] = max(left_profits[i - 1], prices[i] - min_price)\n        \n                # Calculate right_profits\n                max_price = prices[-1]\n                for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n                    max_price = max(max_price, prices[i])\n                    right_profits[i] = max(right_profits[i + 1], max_price - prices[i])\n        \n                # Calculate the maximum profit with at most two transactions\n                max_profit = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    max_profit = max(max_profit, left_profits[i] + right_profits[i])\n        \n                return max_profit\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit by considering the best possible outcomes for up to two transactions, using dynamic programming to store intermediate results.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [[3, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 1, 4]] Output: 6\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
