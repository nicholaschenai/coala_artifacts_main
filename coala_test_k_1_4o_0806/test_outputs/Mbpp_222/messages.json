        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   We need to create a function that checks if all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. If they do, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, we need to determine the data type of the first element in the tuple.\n   - Then, we will iterate through the rest of the elements in the tuple.\n   - For each element, we will check if its data type matches the data type of the first element.\n   - If we find any element with a different data type, we will return `False`.\n   - If we complete the iteration without finding any mismatched data types, we will return `True`.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function check_type with parameter tuple_data\n       If tuple_data is empty, return True (since there are no elements to compare)\n       Get the data type of the first element in tuple_data and store it in a variable first_type\n       For each element in tuple_data\n           If the data type of the element is not equal to first_type\n               Return False\n       Return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_type(tuple_data: tuple) -> bool:\n    # If the tuple is empty, return True as there are no elements to compare\n    if not tuple_data:\n        return True\n    \n    # Get the data type of the first element\n    first_type = type(tuple_data[0])\n    \n    # Iterate through each element in the tuple\n    for element in tuple_data:\n        # If the type of the current element is not the same as the first element's type\n        if type(element) != first_type:\n            # Return False as not all elements have the same type\n            return False\n    \n    # If all elements have the same type, return True\n    return True\n```\n\nThis solution checks the data type of each element in the tuple against the first element's data type and returns `True` only if all elements have the same type."

The challenge lies in correctly identifying the sets of adjacent sides and checking their colors.\n\n    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution\n\n    1. **Adjacency Sets**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent all possible sets of three adjacent sides on a cube. This is a comprehensive approach that ensures all possible combinations are checked.\n\n    2. **Indexing**: The solution uses 1-based indexing in the tuples, which is adjusted by subtracting 1 when accessing the list of colors. This is a small but crucial detail that ensures the correct sides are being compared.\n\n    3. **Set for Uniqueness**: The use of a set to check if all three sides in a tuple have the same color is efficient. If the length of the set is 1, it means all three sides are the same color.\n\n    4. **Early Exit**: The solution breaks out of the loop as soon as a matching set is found, which is efficient and reduces unnecessary checks.\n\n    ### Why My Approach Failed\n\n    My approach failed because I incorrectly identified the sets of adjacent sides. I assumed only four specific sets of sides, but the official solution considers all possible combinations of three adjacent sides. This oversight led to incorrect results for some test cases.\n\n    ### Learning Points\n\n    - **Comprehensive Checking**: When dealing with geometric problems, ensure all possible configurations are considered. The official solution's use of a list of tuples to represent all adjacency sets is a robust approach.\n\n    - **Indexing**: Pay attention to indexing, especially when converting between 1-based and 0-based systems.\n\n    - **Efficiency**: Using data structures like sets to check for uniqueness can simplify the logic and improve efficiency.\n\n    This experience highlights the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem's geometric constraints and ensuring all possible configurations are considered in the solution.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

We can store the data type of the first element and compare it with the data types of the subsequent elements. If all elements have the same data type as the first one, we return `True`.
