The function should remove all characters from the first string that are present in the second string. The result should be a new string containing only the characters from the first string that are not found in the second string.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Characters to Remove**: First, identify all the characters in the second string. These are the characters that need to be removed from the first string.\n2. **Filter the First String**: Iterate through each character in the first string and check if it is present in the second string.\n3. **Build the Result String**: If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, include it in the result string. Otherwise, skip it.\n4. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters in the first string, return the result string.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction remove_dirty_chars(first_string, second_string):\n    create an empty result string\n    for each character in first_string:\n        if character is not in second_string:\n            append character to result string\n    return result string\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(first_string: str, second_string: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = ''\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the first string\n    for char in first_string:\n        # Check if the character is not in the second string\n        if char not in second_string:\n            # If not, add it to the result string\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the final result string\n    return result\n```"

The chef wants to remove all \"abc\" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove \"abc\" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n        - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. \n\n        -----Output:-----\n        For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no \"abc\" special pair.\n\n        -----Constraints:-----\n        $T \\leq 2 $\n        $1 \\leq String length \\leq 1000 $\n\n        -----Sample Input:-----\n        2\n        aabcc\n        bababccc\n\n        -----Sample Output:-----\n        ac\n        bc\n\n        -----EXPLANATION:-----\n        For 1) after removing \"abc\" at middle we get a new string as ac.\n        For 2) string = bababccc\n        newString1 = babcc  // After removing middle \"abc\"\n        newString2 = bc   //After removing \"abc\"\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n           We have a string consisting of lowercase English letters. We need to repeatedly remove any occurrence of the substring \"abc\" from the string until no such substring exists. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through each character of the string and use a stack to build the resulting string. Whenever we encounter the sequence \"abc\" in the stack, we will remove it. This process will be repeated until we have processed all characters in the string. The stack will help us efficiently manage the removal of \"abc\" sequences.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           For each test case:\n               Initialize an empty stack\n               For each character in the string:\n                   Push the character onto the stack\n                   If the top three characters in the stack form \"abc\":\n                       Pop the top three characters from the stack\n               Convert the stack to a string and output it\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        def remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for string in test_cases:\n                stack = []\n                for char in string:\n                    stack.append(char)\n                    # Check if the last three characters in the stack form \"abc\"\n                    if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n                        # Remove the \"abc\" from the stack\n                        stack.pop()\n                        stack.pop()\n                        stack.pop()\n                # Convert the stack back to a string\n                results.append(''.join(stack))\n            return results\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        # First line is the number of test cases\n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = data[1:T+1]\n\n        # Get the results\n        results = remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases)\n\n        # Print the results\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses a stack to efficiently manage the removal of \"abc\" sequences from the string. By checking the top three elements of the stack, we can determine when to remove the sequence and continue processing the rest of the string.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['2', 'aabcc', 'bababccc'] Output: ac\n        bc\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
