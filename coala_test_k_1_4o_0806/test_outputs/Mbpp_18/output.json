    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We have two strings. The task is to remove all characters from the first string that are present in the second string. The result should be a new string containing only the characters from the first string that are not in the second string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the first string and check if it is present in the second string. If a character is not present in the second string, we add it to a new result string. This way, we build a new string that contains only the characters from the first string that are not in the second string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty result string\n   For each character in the first string:\n       If the character is not in the second string:\n           Add the character to the result string\n   Return the result string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_dirty_chars(s1: str, s2: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty result string\n    result = ''\n    # Iterate over each character in the first string\n    for char in s1:\n        # If the character is not in the second string, add it to the result\n        if char not in s2:\n            result += char\n    # Return the result string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each character in the first string and checks if it is present in the second string. If not, it appends the character to the result string. This way, we filter out all characters from the first string that are present in the second string.",
