INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/18 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes two strings as input. The function should remove all characters from the first string that are present in the second string. The result should be a new string containing only the characters from the first string that are not found in the second string.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Characters to Remove**: First, identify all the characters in the second string. These are the characters that need to be removed from the first string.
2. **Filter the First String**: Iterate through each character in the first string and check if it is present in the second string.
3. **Build the Result String**: If a character from the first string is not found in the second string, include it in the result string. Otherwise, skip it.
4. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters in the first string, return the result string.

## Pseudocode

```
function remove_dirty_chars(first_string, second_string):
    create an empty result string
    for each character in first_string:
        if character is not in second_string:
            append character to result string
    return result string
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def remove_dirty_chars(first_string: str, second_string: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to store the result
    result = ''
    
    # Iterate over each character in the first string
    for char in first_string:
        # Check if the character is not in the second string
        if char not in second_string:
            # If not, add it to the result string
            result += char
    
    # Return the final result string
    return result

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

        -----Constraints:-----
        $T \leq 2 $
        $1 \leq String length \leq 1000 $

        -----Sample Input:-----
        2
        aabcc
        bababccc

        -----Sample Output:-----
        ac
        bc

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        For 1) after removing "abc" at middle we get a new string as ac.
        For 2) string = bababccc
        newString1 = babcc  // After removing middle "abc"
        newString2 = bc   //After removing "abc"

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We have a string consisting of lowercase English letters. We need to repeatedly remove any occurrence of the substring "abc" from the string until no such substring exists. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through each character of the string and use a stack to build the resulting string. Whenever we encounter the sequence "abc" in the stack, we will remove it. This process will be repeated until we have processed all characters in the string. The stack will help us efficiently manage the removal of "abc" sequences.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           For each test case:
               Initialize an empty stack
               For each character in the string:
                   Push the character onto the stack
                   If the top three characters in the stack form "abc":
                       Pop the top three characters from the stack
               Convert the stack to a string and output it
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for string in test_cases:
                stack = []
                for char in string:
                    stack.append(char)
                    # Check if the last three characters in the stack form "abc"
                    if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:
                        # Remove the "abc" from the stack
                        stack.pop()
                        stack.pop()
                        stack.pop()
                # Convert the stack back to a string
                results.append(''.join(stack))
            return results

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        # First line is the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = data[1:T+1]

        # Get the results
        results = remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases)

        # Print the results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        This solution uses a stack to efficiently manage the removal of "abc" sequences from the string. By checking the top three elements of the stack, we can determine when to remove the sequence and continue processing the rest of the string.
