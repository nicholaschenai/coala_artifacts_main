    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the number of binary sequences of length `2n` such that the sum of the first `n` bits is equal to the sum of the last `n` bits. This means that the number of 1s in the first half of the sequence should be equal to the number of 1s in the second half.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use combinatorics. For a binary sequence of length `2n`, we need to ensure that the number of 1s in the first `n` bits is equal to the number of 1s in the last `n` bits. If we denote the number of 1s in the first half as `k`, then the number of 1s in the second half must also be `k`. The number of ways to choose `k` 1s from `n` bits is given by the binomial coefficient `C(n, k)`. Therefore, the total number of valid sequences is the sum of `C(n, k)^2` for all possible values of `k` from 0 to `n`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function count_binary_seq(n):\n       total_count = 0\n       for k from 0 to n:\n           count_k = binomial_coefficient(n, k)\n           total_count += count_k * count_k\n       return total_count\n\n   function binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n       if k > n:\n           return 0\n       if k == 0 or k == n:\n           return 1\n       return factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef factorial(x):\n    # Calculate the factorial of x\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(2, x + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\ndef binomial_coefficient(n, k):\n    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n, k)\n    if k > n:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0 or k == n:\n        return 1\n    return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))\n\ndef count_binary_seq(n):\n    # Initialize the total count of valid sequences\n    total_count = 0\n    # Iterate over all possible numbers of 1s in the first half\n    for k in range(n + 1):\n        # Calculate the number of ways to choose k 1s in the first half\n        count_k = binomial_coefficient(n, k)\n        # Add the square of this count to the total count\n        total_count += count_k * count_k\n    # Return the total count of valid sequences\n    return total_count\n```",
