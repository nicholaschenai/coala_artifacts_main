By taking the number modulo 10, we can obtain the last digit. This works because dividing a number by 10 shifts all digits to the right, and the remainder of this division is the last digit.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `last_Digit` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n   - Use the modulus operator to find the last digit: `last_digit = n % 10`.\n   - Return the value of `last_digit`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef last_Digit(n: int) -> int:\n    # Use modulus operator to get the last digit of the number\n    last_digit = n % 10\n    # Return the last digit\n    return last_digit\n```\n\nThis solution uses the modulus operator to efficiently extract the last digit of the given integer."

Now, you should perform the following process:\n        - Let $D = (D_1, D_2, \\ldots, D_l)$.\n        - If $l = 1$, the process ends.\n        - Create a new sequence $E = (D_2, D_4, \\ldots, D_{2 \\lfloor l/2 \\rfloor})$. In other words, $E$ is the sequence created by removing all odd-indexed elements from $D$.\n        - Change $D$ to $E$.\n        When this process terminates, the sequence $D$ contains only one number. You have to find this number.\n\n        -----Input-----\n        - The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n        - The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\n\n        -----Output-----\n        For each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2015 the last remaining number.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n        - $1 \\le N \\le 10^{18}$\n\n        -----Subtasks-----\n        Subtask #1 (20 points):\n        - $1 \\le T \\le 10^5$\n        - $1 \\le N \\le 10^7$\n        Subtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\n        -----Example Input-----\n        1\n        9\n\n        -----Example Output-----\n        3\n\n        -----Explanation-----\n        Example case 1: The first $N$ Fibonacci numbers are $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)$. The sequence $D$ is $(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 2, 5, 3) \\rightarrow (2, 3) \\rightarrow (3)$.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        ### Analysis of the Problem\n\n        The issue seems to be related to the way the code is structured, particularly with the input and output handling. The function `solve()` is defined but not called, which means the code that reads input and produces output is never executed. This is a common mistake when writing solutions that rely on standard input and output.\n\n        ### Step-by-Step Correction\n\n        1. **Function Call**: Ensure that the `solve()` function is called so that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.\n\n        2. **Input Handling**: The input is read from standard input, and the results are stored in a list. Each result is then printed in sequence.\n\n        3. **Output Handling**: Ensure that the results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.\n\n        ### Corrected Python Code\n\n        ```python\n        def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):\n            # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers\n            last_digits = [0, 1]\n            for i in range(2, 60):\n                last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)\n    \n            # Find the position in the cycle\n            position = n % 60\n    \n            # Simulate the reduction process\n            sequence = last_digits[:position]\n            while len(sequence) > 1:\n                sequence = sequence[1::2]  # Keep only even-indexed elements (1-based)\n    \n            return sequence[0]\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            results = []\n    \n            for i in range(1, T + 1):\n                N = int(data[i])\n                result = last_digit_of_fibonacci(N)\n                results.append(result)\n    \n            for res in results:\n                print(res)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the solution\n        solve()\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Corrections\n\n        - **Function Call**: The `solve()` function is now called at the end of the script to ensure that the input is read and processed, and the output is generated.\n        - **Input and Output**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.read()`, and the results are stored in a list. Each result is printed in sequence after processing all test cases.\n\n        This should resolve the issue of no output being detected, as the function is now executed properly.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def last_digit_of_fibonacci(n):\n            # Precompute the last digits of the first 60 Fibonacci numbers\n            last_digits = [0, 1]\n            for i in range(2, 60):\n                last_digits.append((last_digits[i-1] + last_digits[i-2]) % 10)\n    \n            # Find the position in the cycle\n            position = n % 60\n    \n            # Simulate the reduction process\n            sequence = last_digits[:position]\n            while len(sequence) > 1:\n                sequence = sequence[1::2]  # Keep only even-indexed elements (1-based)\n    \n            return sequence[0]\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            T = int(data[0])\n            results = []\n    \n            for i in range(1, T + 1):\n                N = int(data[i])\n                result = last_digit_of_fibonacci(N)\n                results.append(result)\n    \n            for res in results:\n                print(res)\n\n        # Call the solve function to execute the solution\n        solve()\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['1', '9'] Output: 3\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
