However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights:\n\n    1. **Data Structures**: The official solution uses a dictionary to map scores to the number of contestants, which is a neat way to handle the association between scores and contestants. This approach is similar to my use of `zip` to pair scores and contestants, but the dictionary provides direct access to the number of contestants for a given score.\n\n    2. **Sorting and Counting**: Both solutions involve sorting the scores and counting the number of decreases in the number of contestants. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to compare consecutive elements, which is a clean and efficient way to count decreases.\n\n    3. **Handling Ties**: The official solution uses a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score and then sorts these groups. This is an effective way to handle ties, ensuring that problems with the same difficulty are sorted by their indices.\n\n    4. **Output**: The official solution constructs a final list of problem indices by iterating over sorted difficulty scores and their associated problem indices. This approach is clear and ensures the correct order of output.\n\n    Overall, both solutions are similar in logic and efficiency. The official solution's use of dictionaries for grouping and sorting is a useful technique for handling ties and organizing data, which can be applied to similar problems in the future.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The union should include each element only once, even if it appears in both tuples.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Combine the Tuples**: First, we need to combine the elements of both tuples into a single collection. This can be done by concatenating the tuples.\n\n2. **Remove Duplicates**: To ensure each element appears only once, we can convert the combined collection into a set, which inherently removes duplicates.\n\n3. **Sort the Elements**: Convert the set back into a list and sort it in ascending order.\n\n4. **Convert to Tuple**: Finally, convert the sorted list back into a tuple, as the output needs to be a tuple.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Concatenate the two input tuples.\n2. Convert the concatenated result into a set to remove duplicates.\n3. Convert the set into a list and sort it.\n4. Convert the sorted list into a tuple.\n5. Return the resulting tuple.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef union_elements(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:\n    # Step 1: Concatenate the tuples\n    combined = tuple1 + tuple2\n    \n    # Step 2: Convert to set to remove duplicates\n    unique_elements = set(combined)\n    \n    # Step 3: Sort the unique elements\n    sorted_elements = sorted(unique_elements)\n    \n    # Step 4: Convert the sorted list back to a tuple\n    result = tuple(sorted_elements)\n    \n    # Step 5: Return the result\n    return result\n```"
