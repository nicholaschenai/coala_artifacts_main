INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/604 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a string as input. This string contains words separated by spaces. The function should return a new string where the order of the words is reversed.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, we will split the input string into a list of words using spaces as the delimiter.
   - Then, we will reverse the order of the words in this list.
   - Finally, we will join the reversed list of words back into a single string with spaces in between each word and return this string.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `reverse_words` that takes a single parameter `s`.
   - Split the string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method.
   - Reverse the list of words.
   - Join the reversed list into a single string with spaces in between using the `join()` method.
   - Return the resulting string.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def reverse_words(s: str) -> str:
    # Split the input string into a list of words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Reverse the list of words
    reversed_words = words[::-1]
    
    # Join the reversed list of words into a single string with spaces
    reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)
    
    # Return the resulting reversed string
    return reversed_string
```

This function will take a string, split it into words, reverse the order of those words, and then join them back into a single string with spaces, effectively reversing the order of words in the original string.

    [Task]:
        Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
        We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
        Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
        It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
        Example 1:
        Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
        Output: "abcd"
        Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
        Example 2:
        Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
        Output: "aa"
        Explanation: 
        First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
        Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
        Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
        Example 3:
        Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
        Output: "ps"

Â 
        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 10^5
        2 <= k <= 10^4
        s only contains lower case English letters.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string. For each character in the string:
           - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.
           - If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack.
           - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.
           - Finally, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function removeDuplicates(s, k):
               Initialize an empty stack
       
               for each character in s:
                   if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:
                       Increment the count of the top element in the stack
                       if count equals k:
                           Pop the top element from the stack
                   else:
                       Push (character, 1) onto the stack
       
               Initialize result as an empty string
               for each (character, count) in stack:
                   Append character repeated count times to result
       
               return result
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
                # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts
                stack = []
        
                # Iterate over each character in the string
                for char in s:
                    if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                        # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character
                        stack[-1][1] += 1  # Increment the count of the top element
                        if stack[-1][1] == k:
                            # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack
                            stack.pop()
                    else:
                        # If the stack is empty or the top character is different, push the current character with count 1
                        stack.append([char, 1])
        
                # Reconstruct the result string from the stack
                result = ''
                for char, count in stack:
                    result += char * count  # Append the character repeated 'count' times
        
                return result
        ```

        This solution efficiently manages the removal of `k` adjacent duplicates using a stack, ensuring that the operations are performed in linear time relative to the length of the string.
