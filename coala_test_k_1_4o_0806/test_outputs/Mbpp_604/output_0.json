    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where the order of the words is reversed. Words in the string are separated by spaces.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To reverse the words in a string, we can:\n   - Split the string into a list of words using spaces as the delimiter.\n   - Reverse the list of words.\n   - Join the reversed list back into a single string with spaces in between each word.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function reverse_words(s):\n       Split the string s into a list of words using spaces as the delimiter\n       Reverse the list of words\n       Join the reversed list into a single string with spaces in between\n       Return the resulting string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s: str) -> str:\n    # Split the string into a list of words\n    words = s.split()\n    # Reverse the list of words\n    reversed_words = words[::-1]\n    # Join the reversed list into a single string with spaces in between\n    result = ' '.join(reversed_words)\n    # Return the resulting string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently reverses the order of words in the input string by leveraging Python's built-in string and list operations.",
