This string contains words separated by spaces. The function should return a new string where the order of the words is reversed.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, we will split the input string into a list of words using spaces as the delimiter.\n   - Then, we will reverse the order of the words in this list.\n   - Finally, we will join the reversed list of words back into a single string with spaces in between each word and return this string.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `reverse_words` that takes a single parameter `s`.\n   - Split the string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method.\n   - Reverse the list of words.\n   - Join the reversed list into a single string with spaces in between using the `join()` method.\n   - Return the resulting string.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s: str) -> str:\n    # Split the input string into a list of words\n    words = s.split()\n    \n    # Reverse the list of words\n    reversed_words = words[::-1]\n    \n    # Join the reversed list of words into a single string with spaces\n    reversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_words)\n    \n    # Return the resulting reversed string\n    return reversed_string\n```\n\nThis function will take a string, split it into words, reverse the order of those words, and then join them back into a single string with spaces, effectively reversing the order of words in the original string."

Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string. For each character in the string:\n           - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.\n           - If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack.\n           - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.\n           - Finally, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function removeDuplicates(s, k):\n               Initialize an empty stack\n       \n               for each character in s:\n                   if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:\n                       Increment the count of the top element in the stack\n                       if count equals k:\n                           Pop the top element from the stack\n                   else:\n                       Push (character, 1) onto the stack\n       \n               Initialize result as an empty string\n               for each (character, count) in stack:\n                   Append character repeated count times to result\n       \n               return result\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n                # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n                stack = []\n        \n                # Iterate over each character in the string\n                for char in s:\n                    if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                        # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character\n                        stack[-1][1] += 1  # Increment the count of the top element\n                        if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                            # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack\n                            stack.pop()\n                    else:\n                        # If the stack is empty or the top character is different, push the current character with count 1\n                        stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n                # Reconstruct the result string from the stack\n                result = ''\n                for char, count in stack:\n                    result += char * count  # Append the character repeated 'count' times\n        \n                return result\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently manages the removal of `k` adjacent duplicates using a stack, ensuring that the operations are performed in linear time relative to the length of the string.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['\"abcd\"', 2] Output: \"abcd\"\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
