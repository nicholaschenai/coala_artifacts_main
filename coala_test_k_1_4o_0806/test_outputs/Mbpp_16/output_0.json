    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given string contains sequences of lowercase letters that are joined by an underscore. If such sequences exist, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and check if there is at least one underscore ('_') in the string. If an underscore is found, we then need to ensure that there are lowercase letters on both sides of the underscore. If both conditions are met, we return `True`. If we finish checking the string and do not find such a pattern, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function text_lowercase_underscore(s):\n       for each character in the string s:\n           if the character is an underscore:\n               check if there is a lowercase letter before and after the underscore\n               if both are true, return True\n       return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef text_lowercase_underscore(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Iterate through the string, starting from the second character and ending at the second last character\n    for i in range(1, len(s) - 1):\n        # Check if the current character is an underscore\n        if s[i] == '_':\n            # Check if the characters before and after the underscore are lowercase letters\n            if s[i - 1].islower() and s[i + 1].islower():\n                return True\n    # If no valid pattern is found, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis function checks for the presence of an underscore with lowercase letters on both sides, returning `True` if such a pattern is found, and `False` otherwise.",
