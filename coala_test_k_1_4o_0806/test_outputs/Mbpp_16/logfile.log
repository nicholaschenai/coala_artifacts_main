INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/16 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given string consists of sequences of lowercase letters separated by underscores. If the string matches this pattern, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each character in the string.
   - We will check if the string contains only lowercase letters and underscores.
   - We will ensure that underscores are not at the start or end of the string and that they are not consecutive.
   - If all these conditions are met, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function text_lowercase_underscore(s):
       If the string is empty, return False
       If the first or last character is an underscore, return False
       Initialize a variable to track if the previous character was an underscore
       For each character in the string:
           If the character is not a lowercase letter and not an underscore, return False
           If the character is an underscore:
               If the previous character was also an underscore, return False
               Set the previous character as underscore
           Else:
               Set the previous character as not underscore
       Return True
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_lowercase_underscore(s: str) -> bool:
    # If the string is empty, it cannot match the pattern
    if not s:
        return False
    
    # If the first or last character is an underscore, return False
    if s[0] == '_' or s[-1] == '_':
        return False
    
    # Initialize a variable to track if the previous character was an underscore
    previous_was_underscore = False
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # If the character is not a lowercase letter and not an underscore, return False
        if not (char.islower() or char == '_'):
            return False
        
        # If the character is an underscore
        if char == '_':
            # If the previous character was also an underscore, return False
            if previous_was_underscore:
                return False
            # Set the previous character as underscore
            previous_was_underscore = True
        else:
            # Set the previous character as not underscore
            previous_was_underscore = False
    
    # If all checks are passed, return True
    return True

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Acacius is studying strings theory. Today he came with the following problem.

        You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks. It is possible to replace question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once?

        Each question mark should be replaced with exactly one lowercase English letter. For example, string "a?b?c" can be transformed into strings "aabbc" and "azbzc", but can't be transformed into strings "aabc", "a?bbc" and "babbc".

        Occurrence of a string $t$ of length $m$ in the string $s$ of length $n$ as a substring is a index $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - m + 1$) such that string $s[i..i+m-1]$ consisting of $m$ consecutive symbols of $s$ starting from $i$-th equals to string $t$. For example string "ababa" has two occurrences of a string "aba" as a substring with $i = 1$ and $i = 3$, but there are no occurrences of a string "aba" in the string "acba" as a substring.

        Please help Acacius to check if it is possible to replace all question marks with lowercase English letters in such a way that a string "abacaba" occurs as a substring in a resulting string exactly once.


        -----Input-----

        First line of input contains an integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 5000$), number of test cases. $T$ pairs of lines with test case descriptions follow.

        The first line of a test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 50$), length of a string $s$.

        The second line of a test case description contains string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase English letters and question marks.


        -----Output-----

        For each test case output an answer for it.

        In case if there is no way to replace question marks in string $s$ with a lowercase English letters in such a way that there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the resulting string as a substring output "No".

        Otherwise output "Yes" and in the next line output a resulting string consisting of $n$ lowercase English letters. If there are multiple possible strings, output any.

        You may print every letter in "Yes" and "No" in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive answer).


        -----Example-----
        Input
        6
        7
        abacaba
        7
        ???????
        11
        aba?abacaba
        11
        abacaba?aba
        15
        asdf???f???qwer
        11
        abacabacaba

        Output
        Yes
        abacaba
        Yes
        abacaba
        Yes
        abadabacaba
        Yes
        abacabadaba
        No
        No



        -----Note-----

        In first example there is exactly one occurrence of a string "abacaba" in the string "abacaba" as a substring.

        In second example seven question marks can be replaced with any seven lowercase English letters and with "abacaba" in particular.

        In sixth example there are two occurrences of a string "abacaba" as a substring.

    [Previous Critique]:
        Let's analyze the problem with the current solution and identify where it might be going wrong:

        1. **Reading Input**: The solution uses `sys.stdin.read()` to read input, which is correct for competitive programming environments. However, if the function `solve()` is not called, the code will not execute. This is a common mistake when using functions to encapsulate logic but forgetting to call them.

        2. **Output Handling**: The solution appends results to a list and prints them at the end. This is a valid approach, but if the function is not called, no output will be generated.

        3. **Function Call**: The main issue seems to be that the `solve()` function is defined but never called. This would result in no output being produced, as the logic inside `solve()` is never executed.

        4. **Logic for Replacing '?'**: The logic for replacing '?' with 'z' is correct, but it should be ensured that the replacement happens only after confirming that "abacaba" can be placed at a specific position.

        5. **Checking for Unique Occurrence**: The logic to check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once seems correct, but it should be verified that the string is correctly modified before this check.

        To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the `solve()` function is called, and the input/output handling is correctly set up. Let's update the solution accordingly.

        ```python
        def can_place_abacaba(s, i):
            target = "abacaba"
            for j in range(7):
                if s[i + j] != '?' and s[i + j] != target[j]:
                    return False
            return True

        def count_abacaba(s):
            target = "abacaba"
            count = 0
            for i in range(len(s) - 6):
                if s[i:i+7] == target:
                    count += 1
            return count

        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            T = int(data[0])
            index = 1
            results = []
    
            for _ in range(T):
                n = int(data[index])
                s = data[index + 1]
                index += 2
        
                found = False
                for i in range(n - 6):
                    if can_place_abacaba(s, i):
                        # Try to place "abacaba" at position i
                        new_s = list(s)
                        for j in range(7):
                            if new_s[i + j] == '?':
                                new_s[i + j] = "abacaba"[j]
                
                        # Replace remaining '?' with 'z'
                        new_s = ''.join(c if c != '?' else 'z' for c in new_s)
                
                        # Check if "abacaba" occurs exactly once
                        if count_abacaba(new_s) == 1:
                            results.append("Yes")
                            results.append(new_s)
                            found = True
                            break
        
                if not found:
                    results.append("No")
    
            for result in results:
                print(result)

        # Call the solve function to execute the solution
        solve()
        ```

        ### Key Fixes:
        - **Function Call**: Added a call to `solve()` at the end of the script to ensure the logic is executed.
        - **Input/Output Handling**: Ensured that the input is read and output is printed correctly by calling the function.

        This should resolve the issue of no output being detected and ensure the solution logic is executed correctly.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/16 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given string contains sequences of lowercase letters that are joined by an underscore. If such sequences exist, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and check if there is at least one underscore ('_') in the string. If an underscore is found, we then need to ensure that there are lowercase letters on both sides of the underscore. If both conditions are met, we return `True`. If we finish checking the string and do not find such a pattern, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function text_lowercase_underscore(s):
       for each character in the string s:
           if the character is an underscore:
               check if there is a lowercase letter before and after the underscore
               if both are true, return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_lowercase_underscore(s: str) -> bool:
    # Iterate through the string, starting from the second character and ending at the second last character
    for i in range(1, len(s) - 1):
        # Check if the current character is an underscore
        if s[i] == '_':
            # Check if the characters before and after the underscore are lowercase letters
            if s[i - 1].islower() and s[i + 1].islower():
                return True
    # If no valid pattern is found, return False
    return False
```

This function checks for the presence of an underscore with lowercase letters on both sides, returning `True` if such a pattern is found, and `False` otherwise.

 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given string contains sequences of lowercase letters that are joined by an underscore. If such sequences exist, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and check if there is at least one underscore ('_') in the string. If an underscore is found, we then need to ensure that there are lowercase letters on both sides of the underscore. If both conditions are met, we return `True`. If we finish checking the string and do not find such a pattern, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function text_lowercase_underscore(s):
       for each character in the string s:
           if the character is an underscore:
               check if there is a lowercase letter before and after the underscore
               if both are true, return True
       return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_lowercase_underscore(s: str) -> bool:
    # Iterate through the string, starting from the second character and ending at the second last character
    for i in range(1, len(s) - 1):
        # Check if the current character is an underscore
        if s[i] == '_':
            # Check if the characters before and after the underscore are lowercase letters
            if s[i - 1].islower() and s[i + 1].islower():
                return True
    # If no valid pattern is found, return False
    return False
```

This function checks for the presence of an underscore with lowercase letters on both sides, returning `True` if such a pattern is found, and `False` otherwise.
