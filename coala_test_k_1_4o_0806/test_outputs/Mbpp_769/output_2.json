    "raw_msg": "Let's address the issue with the expected output. The function `Diff` is designed to return elements from the first list that are not present in the second list. However, the expected output `[10, 20, 30, 15]` suggests that the order of elements in the result list should be different from the order in which they appear in the first list. This indicates that the problem might require a different approach to ordering the elements in the result list.\n\nUpon further inspection, it seems that the expected output is not sorted but rather follows a specific order that is not immediately clear from the problem statement. The expected output `[10, 20, 30, 15]` suggests that the elements should be ordered in a specific way, possibly by sorting them or using a different method to determine the order of elements.\n\nLet's revise the solution to ensure the order of elements is maintained as per the expected output:\n\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the difference\n    result = []\n    # Iterate over each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not present in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not present, add it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    # Return the list containing elements only in the first list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the difference between two lists by returning elements that are in the first list but not in the second list, maintaining their order from the first list. If the expected output is `[10, 20, 30, 15]`, it might be incorrect based on the problem statement. The function should indeed return `[10, 15, 20, 30]` for the given input, as these are the elements in `list1` that are not in `list2`, in the order they appear in `list1`.",
