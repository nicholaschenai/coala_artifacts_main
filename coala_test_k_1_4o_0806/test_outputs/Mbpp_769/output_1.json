    "raw_msg": "Let's address the issue with the expected output. The function `Diff` is designed to return elements from the first list that are not present in the second list, maintaining their original order. The expected output `[10, 20, 30, 15]` seems to be incorrect based on the problem statement, as the correct output should be `[10, 15, 20, 30]` for the given input.\n\nThe function implementation is already correct, but let's ensure it is presented clearly:\n\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the difference\n    result = []\n    # Iterate over each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not present in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not present, add it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    # Return the list containing elements only in the first list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the difference between two lists by returning elements that are in the first list but not in the second list, maintaining their order from the first list.",
