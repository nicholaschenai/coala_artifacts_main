    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the elements that are present in the first list but not in the second list. This is essentially finding the difference between two lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   To find the difference between two lists, we can iterate over each element in the first list and check if it is not present in the second list. If an element from the first list is not found in the second list, we add it to the result list. This will give us a list of elements that are unique to the first list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function Diff that takes two lists, list1 and list2\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each element in list1:\n           If the element is not in list2:\n               Append the element to result\n       Return the result list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Diff(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the difference\n    result = []\n    # Iterate over each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not present in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not present, add it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    # Return the list containing elements only in the first list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the difference between two lists by returning elements that are in the first list but not in the second list.",
