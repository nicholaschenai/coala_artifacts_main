    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a list of sublists, and we need to find the length of the longest sublist within this list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each sublist in the given list and determine its length. We will keep track of the maximum length encountered during this iteration. Finally, we will return this maximum length as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function Find_Max_Length(list_of_sublists):\n       max_length = 0\n       for each sublist in list_of_sublists:\n           length_of_sublist = length of sublist\n           if length_of_sublist > max_length:\n               max_length = length_of_sublist\n       return max_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Find_Max_Length(list_of_sublists):\n    # Initialize the maximum length to 0\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the list\n    for sublist in list_of_sublists:\n        # Calculate the length of the current sublist\n        length_of_sublist = len(sublist)\n        \n        # Update the maximum length if the current sublist is longer\n        if length_of_sublist > max_length:\n            max_length = length_of_sublist\n    \n    # Return the maximum length found\n    return max_length\n```\n",
