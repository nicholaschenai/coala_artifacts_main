INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/562 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist within it.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate through each sublist in the main list.
   - For each sublist, we will determine its length.
   - We will keep track of the maximum length encountered during the iteration.
   - Finally, we will return this maximum length as the result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function Find_Max_Length that takes a list of lists as input.
   Initialize a variable max_length to 0.
   For each sublist in the input list:
       Calculate the length of the sublist.
       If this length is greater than max_length, update max_length.
   Return max_length.
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def Find_Max_Length(list_of_lists):
    # Initialize the maximum length to 0
    max_length = 0
    
    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Calculate the length of the current sublist
        current_length = len(sublist)
        
        # Update max_length if the current sublist is longer
        if current_length > max_length:
            max_length = current_length
    
    # Return the maximum length found
    return max_length
```

This function will correctly find and return the length of the longest sublist in the given list of lists.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence within this list. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements. The task is to determine the length of the longest subsequence where each element is greater than the preceding one.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We will maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. Initially, each element in `d` is set to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element in the list, we will check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence will be the maximum value in the `d` array.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function lengthOfLIS(nums):
               if nums is empty:
                   return 0
       
               n = length of nums
               d = array of size n initialized to 1
       
               for i from 1 to n-1:
                   for j from 0 to i-1:
                       if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                           d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
       
               return max value in d
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                # If the input list is empty, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 0
                if not nums:
                    return 0
        
                # Initialize the dynamic programming array with 1s
                # Each element is a subsequence of length 1 by itself
                n = len(nums)
                d = [1] * n
        
                # Iterate over each element in the list
                for i in range(1, n):
                    # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence
                    for j in range(i):
                        if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                            # Update the dp array to reflect the longest subsequence ending at i
                            d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
                # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the dp array
                return max(d)
        ```

        This solution uses dynamic programming to achieve an O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable for the problem's requirements.
