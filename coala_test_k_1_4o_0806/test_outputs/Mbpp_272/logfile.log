INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/272 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains multiple elements, and we need to extract the last element from each tuple and return these elements as a list.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, we will access the last element using negative indexing.
   - We will collect these last elements into a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this list of last elements.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define a function named rear_extract that takes a list of tuples as input.
   Initialize an empty list called result.
   For each tuple in the input list:
       Access the last element of the tuple using negative indexing.
       Append this element to the result list.
   Return the result list.
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def rear_extract(tuples_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the last elements of each tuple
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list
    for tup in tuples_list:
        # Access the last element of the tuple using negative indexing
        last_element = tup[-1]
        
        # Append the last element to the result list
        result.append(last_element)
    
    # Return the list containing the last elements of each tuple
    return result
```

This solution iterates over each tuple in the input list, extracts the last element using negative indexing, and appends it to a result list, which is then returned.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Recursive Approach**: The official solution uses a recursive lambda function `unflatten` to handle the depth of processing. This is a concise way to manage the alternating direction and depth levels, which was a challenge in my initial attempts.

    2. **Direction Handling**: The official solution effectively uses list slicing and indexing to handle both left-to-right and right-to-left processing. The use of `[0, 1][c&1]` to toggle between directions based on the current depth (`c`) is a clever way to manage direction without explicit conditionals.

    3. **Subarray Processing**: The `parse` function in the official solution handles subarray processing by checking if the current element is a list and recursively parsing it. This ensures that nested structures are correctly processed at each depth level.

    4. **Index Management**: The use of list slicing and the ternary operator to decide whether to create a subarray or add an element directly is efficient. The solution uses `mod` to determine the size of the subarray and adjusts the index accordingly, which was a point of failure in my attempts.

    5. **Conciseness and Efficiency**: The official solution is more concise and efficient, using Python's list slicing and indexing capabilities to handle complex operations in fewer lines of code. This highlights the importance of leveraging Python's built-in features for more elegant solutions.

    Overall, the official solution provides a more robust and efficient approach to solving the problem, particularly in handling direction changes and recursive subarray processing. This experience underscores the value of concise code and the effective use of Python's capabilities in solving complex problems.
