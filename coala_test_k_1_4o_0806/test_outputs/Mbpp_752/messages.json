The Jacobsthal sequence is defined as follows: \n- The 0th Jacobsthal number is 0.\n- The 1st Jacobsthal number is 1.\n- For n >= 2, the nth Jacobsthal number is given by the formula: `J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2)`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently calculate the nth Jacobsthal number. The recursive approach will follow the definition of the sequence, and memoization will help us avoid redundant calculations by storing previously computed values.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a helper function `jacobsthal_helper(n, memo)` that:\n   - If `n` is 0, return 0.\n   - If `n` is 1, return 1.\n   - If `n` is already in `memo`, return `memo[n]`.\n   - Otherwise, calculate `J(n)` using the formula `J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2)`.\n   - Store the result in `memo[n]` and return it.\n\n2. Define the main function `jacobsthal_num(n)` that:\n   - Initializes an empty dictionary `memo` to store computed Jacobsthal numbers.\n   - Calls `jacobsthal_helper(n, memo)` and returns the result.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef jacobsthal_helper(n, memo):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    \n    # Calculate the nth Jacobsthal number using the recursive formula\n    result = jacobsthal_helper(n - 1, memo) + 2 * jacobsthal_helper(n - 2, memo)\n    memo[n] = result\n    return result\n\ndef jacobsthal_num(n: int) -> int:\n    memo = {}\n    return jacobsthal_helper(n, memo)\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently compute the nth Jacobsthal number. The `jacobsthal_helper` function handles the recursive calculation and stores results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations. The main function `jacobsthal_num` initializes the memoization dictionary and calls the helper function to get the result."

However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:\n\n    1. **Formula Derivation**:\n       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.\n\n    2. **Handling the First Term**:\n       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**:\n       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.\n\n    4. **Code Simplicity**:\n       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.\n\n    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
