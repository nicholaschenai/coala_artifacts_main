    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the nth Jacobsthal number. The Jacobsthal sequence is defined as follows: \n- The 0th Jacobsthal number is 0.\n- The 1st Jacobsthal number is 1.\n- For n >= 2, the nth Jacobsthal number is given by the recurrence relation: J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the recurrence relation to compute the Jacobsthal numbers iteratively. We will start with the base cases and then use a loop to calculate subsequent numbers up to the nth number.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. If n is 0, return 0.\n2. If n is 1, return 1.\n3. Initialize two variables, `prev2` and `prev1`, to store the two previous Jacobsthal numbers, starting with 0 and 1 respectively.\n4. For each number from 2 to n:\n   - Calculate the current Jacobsthal number using the formula: `current = prev1 + 2 * prev2`.\n   - Update `prev2` to `prev1` and `prev1` to `current`.\n5. Return the last calculated Jacobsthal number.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef jacobsthal_num(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base cases\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two Jacobsthal numbers\n    prev2 = 0  # J(0)\n    prev1 = 1  # J(1)\n    \n    # Calculate Jacobsthal numbers iteratively\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        current = prev1 + 2 * prev2\n        prev2 = prev1\n        prev1 = current\n    \n    return prev1\n```\n\nThis code efficiently calculates the nth Jacobsthal number using an iterative approach, which is both time and space efficient.",
