INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/752 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the nth Jacobsthal number. The Jacobsthal sequence is defined as follows: 
- The 0th Jacobsthal number is 0.
- The 1st Jacobsthal number is 1.
- For n >= 2, the nth Jacobsthal number is given by the formula: `J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2)`.

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently calculate the nth Jacobsthal number. The recursive approach will follow the definition of the sequence, and memoization will help us avoid redundant calculations by storing previously computed values.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a helper function `jacobsthal_helper(n, memo)` that:
   - If `n` is 0, return 0.
   - If `n` is 1, return 1.
   - If `n` is already in `memo`, return `memo[n]`.
   - Otherwise, calculate `J(n)` using the formula `J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2)`.
   - Store the result in `memo[n]` and return it.

2. Define the main function `jacobsthal_num(n)` that:
   - Initializes an empty dictionary `memo` to store computed Jacobsthal numbers.
   - Calls `jacobsthal_helper(n, memo)` and returns the result.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def jacobsthal_helper(n, memo):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    
    # Calculate the nth Jacobsthal number using the recursive formula
    result = jacobsthal_helper(n - 1, memo) + 2 * jacobsthal_helper(n - 2, memo)
    memo[n] = result
    return result

def jacobsthal_num(n: int) -> int:
    memo = {}
    return jacobsthal_helper(n, memo)
```

This solution uses a recursive approach with memoization to efficiently compute the nth Jacobsthal number. The `jacobsthal_helper` function handles the recursive calculation and stores results in a dictionary to avoid redundant calculations. The main function `jacobsthal_num` initializes the memoization dictionary and calls the helper function to get the result.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:

    1. **Formula Derivation**:
       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.

    2. **Handling the First Term**:
       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.

    3. **Efficiency**:
       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.

    4. **Code Simplicity**:
       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.

    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.

We need to write a function that calculates the nth Jacobsthal number. The Jacobsthal sequence is defined as follows: 
- The 0th Jacobsthal number is 0.
- The 1st Jacobsthal number is 1.
- For n >= 2, the nth Jacobsthal number is given by the recurrence relation: J(n) = J(n-1) + 2 * J(n-2).

## Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we can use the recurrence relation to compute the Jacobsthal numbers iteratively. We will start with the base cases and then use a loop to calculate subsequent numbers up to the nth number.

## Pseudocode

1. If n is 0, return 0.
2. If n is 1, return 1.
3. Initialize two variables, `prev2` and `prev1`, to store the two previous Jacobsthal numbers, starting with 0 and 1 respectively.
4. For each number from 2 to n:
   - Calculate the current Jacobsthal number using the formula: `current = prev1 + 2 * prev2`.
   - Update `prev2` to `prev1` and `prev1` to `current`.
5. Return the last calculated Jacobsthal number.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def jacobsthal_num(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first two Jacobsthal numbers
    prev2 = 0  # J(0)
    prev1 = 1  # J(1)
    
    # Calculate Jacobsthal numbers iteratively
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        current = prev1 + 2 * prev2
        prev2 = prev1
        prev1 = current
    
    return prev1
```

This code efficiently calculates the nth Jacobsthal number using an iterative approach, which is both time and space efficient.
