Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n: int) -> int:\n    # Determine the number of bits required to represent the number\n    num_bits = n.bit_length()\n    \n    # Start scanning from the most significant bit to the least significant bit\n    for position in range(num_bits - 1, -1, -1):\n        # Check if the bit at the current position is unset (0)\n        if (n & (1 << position)) == 0:\n            # Set the bit at the current position and return the new number\n            return n | (1 << position)\n    \n    # If all bits are set, set the next higher bit\n    return n | (1 << num_bits)\n```\n\nThis code correctly identifies the leftmost unset bit by scanning from the most significant bit downwards and sets it. If all bits are set, it sets the next higher bit.",
