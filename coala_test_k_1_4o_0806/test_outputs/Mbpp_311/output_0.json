    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the leftmost unset (0) bit in the binary representation of a given integer and set it to 1. The function should return the new integer value after this modification.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Convert the integer to its binary representation.\n   - Identify the leftmost bit that is unset (0).\n   - Set this bit to 1.\n   - Convert the modified binary representation back to an integer and return it.\n\n   The approach involves using bit manipulation:\n   - Iterate over the bits of the integer from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.\n   - Check each bit to find the first unset bit.\n   - Use a bitwise OR operation to set this bit to 1.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function set_left_most_unset_bit(n):\n       position = 0\n       while (1 << position) <= n:\n           if (n & (1 << position)) == 0:\n               return n | (1 << position)\n           position += 1\n       return n | (1 << position)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef set_left_most_unset_bit(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the position to 0, which represents the least significant bit\n    position = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each bit position until we find an unset bit\n    while (1 << position) <= n:\n        # Check if the bit at the current position is unset (0)\n        if (n & (1 << position)) == 0:\n            # Set the bit at the current position and return the new number\n            return n | (1 << position)\n        # Move to the next bit position\n        position += 1\n    \n    # If all bits up to the most significant bit are set, set the next higher bit\n    return n | (1 << position)\n```\n\nThis code iterates through each bit position, checking if the bit is unset. If it finds an unset bit, it sets it and returns the new integer. If all bits up to the current highest bit are set, it sets the next higher bit.",
