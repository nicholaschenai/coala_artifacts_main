    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and counts the number of unique unordered pairs where both elements in the pair are different.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and for each element, count how many elements after it are different. This will give us the number of unique unordered pairs where both elements are unequal. We need to ensure that each pair is only counted once, which is naturally handled by only considering elements after the current element in the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function count_Pairs(arr):\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each index i from 0 to length of arr - 1:\n           for each index j from i + 1 to length of arr - 1:\n               if arr[i] is not equal to arr[j]:\n                   increment count by 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_Pairs(arr):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of valid pairs\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list using its index\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # For each element, iterate over the elements that come after it\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):\n            # If the two elements are different, it's a valid pair\n            if arr[i] != arr[j]:\n                # Increment the count of valid pairs\n                count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of valid pairs\n    return count\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list and checks each possible pair of elements to see if they are unequal, counting each valid pair. The time complexity is O(n^2) due to the nested loops, which is acceptable for reasonably sized lists.",
