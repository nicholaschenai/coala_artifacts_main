    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and two indices. The function should calculate the sum of the numbers in the list that are between the two given indices, inclusive.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to extract the sublist from the given list using the two indices.\n   - Then, we calculate the sum of the numbers in this sublist.\n   - Finally, we return this sum as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function sum_range_list with parameters: list of numbers, start index, end index\n       Extract the sublist from the list using the start and end indices\n       Calculate the sum of the numbers in the sublist\n       Return the calculated sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_range_list(numbers: list, start: int, end: int) -> int:\n    # Extract the sublist from the list using the start and end indices\n    sublist = numbers[start:end+1]\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the numbers in the sublist\n    total_sum = sum(sublist)\n    \n    # Return the calculated sum\n    return total_sum\n```",
