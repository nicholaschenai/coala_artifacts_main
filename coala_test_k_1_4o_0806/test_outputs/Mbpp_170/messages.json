The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:\n    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.\n    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.\n    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.\n    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n            subarray_sums = []\n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n            subarray_sums.sort()\n            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])\n            return result % (10**9 + 7)\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
