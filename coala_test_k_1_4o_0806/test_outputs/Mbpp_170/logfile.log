INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/170 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and two indices. The function should return the sum of the numbers in the list that are within the range specified by these two indices, inclusive.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input**: A list of numbers and two indices.
2. **Output**: The sum of the numbers in the list from the first index to the second index, inclusive.
3. **Approach**:
   - Use Python's list slicing to extract the sublist from the start index to the end index (inclusive).
   - Use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the numbers in this sublist.
   - Return the calculated sum.

### Pseudocode

```
function sum_range_list(numbers, start_index, end_index):
    sublist = numbers[start_index:end_index + 1]
    total_sum = sum(sublist)
    return total_sum
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_range_list(numbers: list, start_index: int, end_index: int) -> int:
    # Extract the sublist from start_index to end_index (inclusive)
    sublist = numbers[start_index:end_index + 1]
    # Calculate the sum of the sublist
    total_sum = sum(sublist)
    # Return the sum
    return total_sum
```

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to compute the sums of all non-empty continuous subarrays of a given array, sort these sums, and then calculate the sum of a specified range of these sorted sums. The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.
    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.
    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.
    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
            subarray_sums = []
            for start in range(n):
                current_sum = 0
                for end in range(start, n):
                    current_sum += nums[end]
                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
            subarray_sums.sort()
            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])
            return result % (10**9 + 7)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.
