        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the number of sequences of length `n` where each element in the sequence is a positive integer. Each element must be at least twice the previous element and must not exceed a given maximum value `m`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: \n   - Each sequence starts with a positive integer.\n   - Each subsequent element must be at least twice the previous element.\n   - No element can exceed `m`.\n   - The sequence must be exactly of length `n`.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n   - Use a recursive function to explore all possible sequences.\n   - Start with the first element and try all possible values from 1 to `m`.\n   - For each element, recursively determine the next element by ensuring it is at least twice the current element and does not exceed `m`.\n   - Count sequences that reach the desired length `n`.\n\n3. **Recursive Function**:\n   - Define a recursive function `count_sequences(current_value, current_length)`:\n     - If `current_length` equals `n`, return 1 (a valid sequence is found).\n     - Initialize a counter to zero.\n     - For each possible next value (from `2 * current_value` to `m`), recursively call the function to extend the sequence.\n     - Accumulate the count of valid sequences.\n   - Start the recursion with `current_value` as 1 and `current_length` as 1.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_sequences(current_value, current_length):\n    if current_length == n:\n        return 1\n    count = 0\n    for next_value from 2 * current_value to m:\n        count += count_sequences(next_value, current_length + 1)\n    return count\n\nfunction get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    total_count = 0\n    for start_value from 1 to m:\n        total_count += count_sequences(start_value, 1)\n    return total_count\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_sequences(current_value, current_length, m, n):\n    # Base case: if the sequence length is n, we have a valid sequence\n    if current_length == n:\n        return 1\n    \n    count = 0\n    # Try all possible next values that are at least twice the current value\n    for next_value in range(2 * current_value, m + 1):\n        count += count_sequences(next_value, current_length + 1, m, n)\n    \n    return count\n\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    total_count = 0\n    # Start sequences with each possible starting value from 1 to m\n    for start_value in range(1, m + 1):\n        total_count += count_sequences(start_value, 1, m, n)\n    \n    return total_count\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive approach to explore all possible sequences, ensuring each element is at least twice the previous one and does not exceed `m`. The function `get_total_number_of_sequences` initializes the process by trying all possible starting values."

The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\n    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.\n\n    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. \n\n    Here is the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            steps = 0\n            while n != 1:\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    n //= 2\n                else:\n                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                        n -= 1\n                    else:\n                        n += 1\n                steps += 1\n            return steps\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

We start with the first element of the sequence and try all possible values for it.
