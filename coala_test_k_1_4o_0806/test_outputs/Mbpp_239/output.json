    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the number of sequences of length `n` where each element in the sequence is a positive integer. Each element must be at least twice the previous element and must not exceed a given maximum value `m`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. We start with the first element of the sequence and try all possible values for it. For each value, we recursively determine the number of valid sequences that can be formed by choosing subsequent elements that are at least twice the current element and do not exceed `m`. We continue this process until we have constructed sequences of length `n`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a recursive function count_sequences(current_value, remaining_length):\n       If remaining_length is 0:\n           Return 1 (a valid sequence is formed)\n       Initialize count to 0\n       For each possible next_value from current_value * 2 to m:\n           Add the result of count_sequences(next_value, remaining_length - 1) to count\n       Return count\n\n   Define the main function get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n       Initialize total_count to 0\n       For each possible starting_value from 1 to m:\n           Add the result of count_sequences(starting_value, n - 1) to total_count\n       Return total_count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_sequences(current_value, remaining_length, m):\n    # Base case: if no more elements are needed, we have a valid sequence\n    if remaining_length == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    count = 0\n    # Try all possible next values that are at least twice the current value and <= m\n    next_value = current_value * 2\n    while next_value <= m:\n        count += count_sequences(next_value, remaining_length - 1, m)\n        next_value += 1\n    \n    return count\n\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    total_count = 0\n    # Try all possible starting values from 1 to m\n    for starting_value in range(1, m + 1):\n        total_count += count_sequences(starting_value, n - 1, m)\n    \n    return total_count\n```\n\nThis solution uses a recursive function `count_sequences` to explore all possible sequences starting from a given value, ensuring each subsequent value is at least twice the previous one and does not exceed `m`. The main function `get_total_number_of_sequences` iterates over all possible starting values and accumulates the total number of valid sequences.",
