The depth is the number of runs, you have to do.\n        - In every run you have to switch the direction. First run from left, next run from right. Next left...\n        Every run has these rules:\n        - You start at the first number (from the direction).\n        - Take for every number x the remainder of the division by the number of still available elements (from \n          this position!) to have the number for the next decision.\n        - If the remainder-value is smaller than 3, take this number x (NOT the remainder-Value) direct\n          for the new array and continue with the next number.\n        - If the remainder-value (e.g. 3) is greater than 2, take the next remainder-value-number (e.g. 3)\n          elements/numbers (inclusive the number x, NOT the remainder-value) as a sub-array in the new array.\n          Continue with the next number/element AFTER this taken elements/numbers.\n        - Every sub-array in the array is independent and is only one element for the progress on the array. \n          For every sub-array you have to follow the same rules for unflatten it.\n          The direction is always the same as the actual run.\n        ```\n\n        Sounds complicated? Yeah, thats why, this is the harder version...\n        Maybe an example will help.\n\n        ```\n         Array: [4, 5, 1, 7, 1] Depth: 2 -> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n \n        Steps: \n        First run: (start from left side!)\n        1. The first number is 4. The number is smaller than the number of remaining elements, so it is the remainder-value (4 / 5 -> remainder 4).\n           So 4 numbers (4, 5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the new array.\n        2. The next number is 1. It is smaller than 3, so the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n        Now we have --> [[4, 5, 1, 7], 1]\n\n        Second run: (start from right side!)\n        1. The last number (first from other side) is 1. So the 1 is added direct to the new array.\n        2. The next element is the sub-array. So we use the rules for this.\n        2a.The last number is 7. There are 4 elements in the array. So for the next decision you have to\n           take the remainder from 7 / 4 -> 3. So 3 numbers (5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the \n           new array.\n        2b.Now there is the 4 and only one element last in this array. 4 / 1 -> remainder 0. It is smaller\n           than 3. So the 4 is added direct to the new array.\n        Now we have --> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]\n        ```\n\n        The given array will always contain numbers.

The transformation process involves multiple runs, alternating the direction of processing (left-to-right, then right-to-left, and so on). Each run involves checking each number in the list and deciding whether to include it directly or as part of a sub-array, based on the remainder of the division of the number by the count of remaining elements.\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Initialize the Process**: Start with the given list and the specified depth of transformation.\n\n        2. **Iterate Over Depth**: For each depth level, process the list in alternating directions:\n           - **Left-to-Right**: Start from the beginning of the list.\n           - **Right-to-Left**: Start from the end of the list.\n\n        3. **Process Each Element**:\n           - Calculate the remainder of the current element divided by the number of remaining elements.\n           - If the remainder is less than 3, add the element directly to the new list.\n           - If the remainder is 3 or more, create a sub-array with the next `remainder` elements and add it to the new list.\n\n        4. **Recursive Processing**: If a sub-array is created, apply the same rules recursively to the sub-array.\n\n        5. **Output the Result**: After processing all depth levels, the list should be fully transformed.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n            for each level in depth:\n                if level is even:\n                    process from left to right\n                else:\n                    process from right to left\n        \n                initialize new_array\n                while there are elements in flat_array:\n                    calculate remainder = current_element % remaining_elements\n                    if remainder < 3:\n                        add current_element to new_array\n                    else:\n                        create sub-array with next 'remainder' elements\n                        add sub-array to new_array\n                        skip 'remainder' elements in flat_array\n        \n                set flat_array to new_array for next level\n\n            return flat_array\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def process_subarray(array, direction):\n            result = []\n            i = 0 if direction == 'left' else len(array) - 1\n            step = 1 if direction == 'left' else -1\n    \n            while 0 <= i < len(array):\n                remaining_elements = len(array) - i if direction == 'left' else i + 1\n                current = array[i]\n                remainder = current % remaining_elements\n        \n                if remainder < 3:\n                    result.append(current)\n                    i += step\n                else:\n                    if direction == 'left':\n                        subarray = array[i:i + remainder]\n                        result.append(process_subarray(subarray, direction))\n                        i += remainder\n                    else:\n                        subarray = array[i - remainder + 1:i + 1]\n                        result.append(process_subarray(subarray, direction))\n                        i -= remainder\n    \n            return result\n\n        def unflatten(flat_array, depth):\n            direction = 'left'\n            for _ in range(depth):\n                flat_array = process_subarray(flat_array, direction)\n                direction = 'right' if direction == 'left' else 'left'\n    \n            return flat_array\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation\n\n        - **process_subarray**: This helper function processes a given array in a specified direction ('left' or 'right'). It calculates the remainder for each element and decides whether to add it directly or as part of a sub-array.\n        - **unflatten**: This function manages the overall process, iterating over the specified depth and alternating the direction of processing.

This ensures that the function always works with a list of lists.\n- **Return a List**: The function now returns a list of lists, which matches the expected output format."

The challenge was to correctly sort the problems based on this difficulty measure.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved:\n    1. Parsing the input to extract scores and contestant numbers for each problem.\n    2. Sorting the subtasks of each problem by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers.\n    3. Using a tuple `(decrease_count, index)` to represent the difficulty, which allowed for easy sorting of problems by difficulty and index.\n\n    A key insight was recognizing that sorting the subtasks by score simplifies the process of counting decreases in contestant numbers. This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially with the number of problems being as large as 100,000.\n\n    The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into these steps, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt. This problem reinforced the importance of sorting and tuple-based sorting for handling complex sorting criteria.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
