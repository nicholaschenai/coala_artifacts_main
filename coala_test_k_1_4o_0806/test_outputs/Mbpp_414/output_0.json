    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if there is any common element between two sequences (lists). If there is at least one common element, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each element in the first sequence and check if it exists in the second sequence. If we find a common element, we can immediately return `True`. If we finish checking all elements and find no common elements, we return `False`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n       For each element in seq1:\n           If the element is in seq2:\n               Return True\n       Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef overlapping(seq1, seq2):\n    # Iterate over each element in the first sequence\n    for element in seq1:\n        # Check if the current element is present in the second sequence\n        if element in seq2:\n            # If a common element is found, return True\n            return True\n    # If no common elements are found, return False\n    return False\n```\n\nThis function efficiently checks for overlapping elements by leveraging Python's `in` keyword, which checks for membership in a sequence.",
