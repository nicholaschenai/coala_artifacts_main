In other words, we need to find the elements that are present in one tuple but not in the other.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Convert both tuples into sets. This will allow us to easily find the unique elements in each tuple.\n2. Use set operations to find the elements that are in the first set but not in the second, and vice versa.\n3. Combine these two sets of unique elements.\n4. Convert the combined set back into a tuple, as the final result should be a tuple.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Convert the first tuple to a set, `set1`.\n2. Convert the second tuple to a set, `set2`.\n3. Find the difference between `set1` and `set2`, call it `unique_in_first`.\n4. Find the difference between `set2` and `set1`, call it `unique_in_second`.\n5. Combine `unique_in_first` and `unique_in_second` into a single set, `dissimilar_elements`.\n6. Convert `dissimilar_elements` to a tuple and return it.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:\n    # Convert tuples to sets\n    set1 = set(tuple1)\n    set2 = set(tuple2)\n    \n    # Find elements unique to each set\n    unique_in_first = set1 - set2\n    unique_in_second = set2 - set1\n    \n    # Combine the unique elements\n    dissimilar_elements = unique_in_first.union(unique_in_second)\n    \n    # Convert the result to a tuple and return\n    return tuple(dissimilar_elements)\n```"

The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.\n    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.\n    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countDivisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        i = 1\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n            i += 1\n        return count\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            A = int(data[index])\n            B = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            diff = abs(A - B)\n        \n            if diff == 0:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                results.append(countDivisors(diff))\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

This will allow us to easily find unique elements using set operations.\n   - Use the symmetric difference operation on these sets. The symmetric difference will give us a set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n   - Convert the resulting set back into a tuple, as the output needs to be a tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n       convert tuple1 to set1\n       convert tuple2 to set2\n       find symmetric difference of set1 and set2\n       convert the symmetric difference set to a tuple\n       return the resulting tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Convert the first tuple to a set\n    set1 = set(tuple1)\n    # Convert the second tuple to a set\n    set2 = set(tuple2)\n    # Find the symmetric difference between the two sets\n    dissimilar_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n    # Convert the resulting set back to a tuple\n    dissimilar_tuple = tuple(dissimilar_set)\n    # Return the tuple of dissimilar elements\n    return dissimilar_tuple\n```\n\nThis function will correctly find and return the dissimilar elements between the two input tuples."
