    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple containing elements that are not common to both input tuples. In other words, we need to find elements that are present in one tuple but not in the other.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can:\n   - Convert each tuple into a set. This will allow us to easily find unique elements using set operations.\n   - Use the symmetric difference operation on these sets. The symmetric difference will give us a set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection.\n   - Convert the resulting set back into a tuple, as the output needs to be a tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n       convert tuple1 to set1\n       convert tuple2 to set2\n       find symmetric difference of set1 and set2\n       convert the symmetric difference set to a tuple\n       return the resulting tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_dissimilar(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Convert the first tuple to a set\n    set1 = set(tuple1)\n    # Convert the second tuple to a set\n    set2 = set(tuple2)\n    # Find the symmetric difference between the two sets\n    dissimilar_set = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)\n    # Convert the resulting set back to a tuple\n    dissimilar_tuple = tuple(dissimilar_set)\n    # Return the tuple of dissimilar elements\n    return dissimilar_tuple\n```\n\nThis function will correctly find and return the dissimilar elements between the two input tuples.",
