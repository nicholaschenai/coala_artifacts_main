INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/579 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes two tuples as input and returns a tuple containing the elements that are not common to both tuples. In other words, we need to find the elements that are present in one tuple but not in the other.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Convert both tuples into sets. This will allow us to easily find the unique elements in each tuple.
2. Use set operations to find the elements that are in the first set but not in the second, and vice versa.
3. Combine these two sets of unique elements.
4. Convert the combined set back into a tuple, as the final result should be a tuple.

## Pseudocode

1. Convert the first tuple to a set, `set1`.
2. Convert the second tuple to a set, `set2`.
3. Find the difference between `set1` and `set2`, call it `unique_in_first`.
4. Find the difference between `set2` and `set1`, call it `unique_in_second`.
5. Combine `unique_in_first` and `unique_in_second` into a single set, `dissimilar_elements`.
6. Convert `dissimilar_elements` to a tuple and return it.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_dissimilar(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Convert tuples to sets
    set1 = set(tuple1)
    set2 = set(tuple2)
    
    # Find elements unique to each set
    unique_in_first = set1 - set2
    unique_in_second = set2 - set1
    
    # Combine the unique elements
    dissimilar_elements = unique_in_first.union(unique_in_second)
    
    # Convert the result to a tuple and return
    return tuple(dissimilar_elements)

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.
