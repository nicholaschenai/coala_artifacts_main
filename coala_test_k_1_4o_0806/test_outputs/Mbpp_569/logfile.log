INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/569 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. The function should sort each sublist in alphabetical order and return the modified list of lists.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Iterate over each sublist in the main list.
2. Sort each sublist alphabetically.
3. Return the list of lists with each sublist sorted.

### Pseudocode

```
function sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    for each sublist in list_of_lists:
        sort the sublist
    return list_of_lists
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def sort_sublists(list_of_lists):
    # Iterate over each sublist in the main list
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # Sort the current sublist in place
        sublist.sort()
    # Return the modified list of lists
    return list_of_lists
```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Recursive Approach**: The official solution uses a recursive lambda function `unflatten` to handle the depth of processing. This is a concise way to manage the alternating direction and depth levels, which was a challenge in my initial attempts.

    2. **Direction Handling**: The official solution effectively uses list slicing and indexing to handle both left-to-right and right-to-left processing. The use of `[0, 1][c&1]` to toggle between directions based on the current depth (`c`) is a clever way to manage direction without explicit conditionals.

    3. **Subarray Processing**: The `parse` function in the official solution handles subarray processing by checking if the current element is a list and recursively parsing it. This ensures that nested structures are correctly processed at each depth level.

    4. **Index Management**: The use of list slicing and the ternary operator to decide whether to create a subarray or add an element directly is efficient. The solution uses `mod` to determine the size of the subarray and adjusts the index accordingly, which was a point of failure in my attempts.

    5. **Conciseness and Efficiency**: The official solution is more concise and efficient, using Python's list slicing and indexing capabilities to handle complex operations in fewer lines of code. This highlights the importance of leveraging Python's built-in features for more elegant solutions.

    Overall, the official solution provides a more robust and efficient approach to solving the problem, particularly in handling direction changes and recursive subarray processing. This experience underscores the value of concise code and the effective use of Python's capabilities in solving complex problems.
