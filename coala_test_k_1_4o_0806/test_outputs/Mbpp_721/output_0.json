    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a square matrix where each cell has a cost. We need to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix, moving only right or down. The goal is to find the path that has the maximum average cost, where the average is calculated as the total cost of the path divided by the number of cells in the path.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum sum of costs from the top-left corner to the cell `(i, j)`. We will also keep track of the number of cells in the path to `(i, j)` in another 2D array `count`. The average for each cell `(i, j)` can be calculated as `dp[i][j] / count[i][j]`. We will iterate through the matrix, updating `dp` and `count` based on the maximum sum path to each cell. Finally, the maximum average path will be found at the bottom-right corner of the matrix.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize dp and count arrays with dimensions N x N\n   Set dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]\n   Set count[0][0] = 1\n\n   For each cell (i, j) in the matrix:\n       If moving from the left (i, j-1) is possible:\n           Calculate potential new sum and count\n           Update dp[i][j] and count[i][j] if this path is better\n       If moving from above (i-1, j) is possible:\n           Calculate potential new sum and count\n           Update dp[i][j] and count[i][j] if this path is better\n\n   Calculate the maximum average at the bottom-right corner as dp[N-1][N-1] / count[N-1][N-1]\n   Return the maximum average\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef maxAverageOfPath(matrix: list[list[int]]) -> float:\n    N = len(matrix)\n    \n    # Initialize dp and count arrays\n    dp = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]\n    count = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]\n    \n    # Base case: starting point\n    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]\n    count[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the dp and count arrays\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                continue\n            # Check from left\n            if j > 0:\n                new_sum = dp[i][j-1] + matrix[i][j]\n                new_count = count[i][j-1] + 1\n                if new_sum * count[i][j] > dp[i][j] * new_count:\n                    dp[i][j] = new_sum\n                    count[i][j] = new_count\n            # Check from above\n            if i > 0:\n                new_sum = dp[i-1][j] + matrix[i][j]\n                new_count = count[i-1][j] + 1\n                if new_sum * count[i][j] > dp[i][j] * new_count:\n                    dp[i][j] = new_sum\n                    count[i][j] = new_count\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum average at the bottom-right corner\n    max_average = dp[N-1][N-1] / count[N-1][N-1]\n    return max_average\n```",
