    "raw_msg": "Let's fix the solution based on the insights from the error analysis and the reference material. The main issue was handling the initial zero values in the `count` array, which led to division by zero errors. We need to ensure that the `count` array is updated correctly for each cell that is reachable.\n\nHere's the corrected Python code:\n\n```python\ndef maxAverageOfPath(matrix: list[list[int]]) -> float:\n    N = len(matrix)\n    \n    # Initialize dp and count arrays\n    dp = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]\n    count = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]\n    \n    # Base case: starting point\n    dp[0][0] = matrix[0][0]\n    count[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the dp and count arrays\n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(N):\n            if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                continue\n            # Check from left\n            if j > 0:\n                new_sum = dp[i][j-1] + matrix[i][j]\n                new_count = count[i][j-1] + 1\n                if count[i][j] == 0 or new_sum * count[i][j] > dp[i][j] * new_count:\n                    dp[i][j] = new_sum\n                    count[i][j] = new_count\n            # Check from above\n            if i > 0:\n                new_sum = dp[i-1][j] + matrix[i][j]\n                new_count = count[i-1][j] + 1\n                if count[i][j] == 0 or new_sum * count[i][j] > dp[i][j] * new_count:\n                    dp[i][j] = new_sum\n                    count[i][j] = new_count\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum average at the bottom-right corner\n    max_average = dp[N-1][N-1] / count[N-1][N-1]\n    return max_average\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n- The condition `if count[i][j] == 0 or new_sum * count[i][j] > dp[i][j] * new_count` ensures that we update `dp[i][j]` and `count[i][j]` if `count[i][j]` is initially zero, which means the cell hasn't been reached yet. This prevents division by zero errors and ensures that the path is correctly updated.",
