INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/630 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a coordinate tuple (x, y) as input and returns a list of lists containing all the adjacent coordinates, including the coordinate itself. The adjacent coordinates are those that differ by at most 1 in either the x or y direction.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Given a coordinate (x, y), we need to find all coordinates that are adjacent to it. This includes the coordinate itself.
2. The adjacent coordinates can be found by varying x and y by -1, 0, or +1.
3. This results in a 3x3 grid centered around the given coordinate (x, y).
4. We will iterate over the possible values of x and y, which are x-1, x, x+1 and y-1, y, y+1, respectively.
5. For each combination of these x and y values, we will create a list [new_x, new_y] and add it to the result list.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty list `adjacent_coordinates`.
2. For each `dx` in [-1, 0, 1]:
   - For each `dy` in [-1, 0, 1]:
     - Calculate `new_x` as `x + dx`.
     - Calculate `new_y` as `y + dy`.
     - Append the list `[new_x, new_y]` to `adjacent_coordinates`.
3. Return `adjacent_coordinates`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def get_coordinates(coord: tuple) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store adjacent coordinates
    adjacent_coordinates = []
    
    # Extract x and y from the input coordinate tuple
    x, y = coord
    
    # Iterate over possible changes in x and y (-1, 0, 1)
    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
            # Calculate new coordinates
            new_x = x + dx
            new_y = y + dy
            # Append the new coordinate to the list
            adjacent_coordinates.append([new_x, new_y])
    
    # Return the list of adjacent coordinates
    return adjacent_coordinates
```

This solution iterates over all possible combinations of x and y offsets, calculates the new coordinates, and appends them to the result list. The function then returns this list, which contains all the adjacent coordinates including the original coordinate.

    ### Reflection on the Problem and Solution

    The problem involves determining if any three adjacent sides of a cube are painted the same color. The challenge lies in correctly identifying the sets of adjacent sides and checking their colors.

    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution

    1. **Adjacency Sets**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent all possible sets of three adjacent sides on a cube. This is a comprehensive approach that ensures all possible combinations are checked.

    2. **Indexing**: The solution uses 1-based indexing in the tuples, which is adjusted by subtracting 1 when accessing the list of colors. This is a small but crucial detail that ensures the correct sides are being compared.

    3. **Set for Uniqueness**: The use of a set to check if all three sides in a tuple have the same color is efficient. If the length of the set is 1, it means all three sides are the same color.

    4. **Early Exit**: The solution breaks out of the loop as soon as a matching set is found, which is efficient and reduces unnecessary checks.

    ### Why My Approach Failed

    My approach failed because I incorrectly identified the sets of adjacent sides. I assumed only four specific sets of sides, but the official solution considers all possible combinations of three adjacent sides. This oversight led to incorrect results for some test cases.

    ### Learning Points

    - **Comprehensive Checking**: When dealing with geometric problems, ensure all possible configurations are considered. The official solution's use of a list of tuples to represent all adjacency sets is a robust approach.

    - **Indexing**: Pay attention to indexing, especially when converting between 1-based and 0-based systems.

    - **Efficiency**: Using data structures like sets to check for uniqueness can simplify the logic and improve efficiency.

    This experience highlights the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem's geometric constraints and ensuring all possible configurations are considered in the solution.
