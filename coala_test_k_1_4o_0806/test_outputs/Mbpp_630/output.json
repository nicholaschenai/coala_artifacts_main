    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a coordinate tuple (x, y) and returns a list of all the coordinates that are adjacent to it, including the coordinate itself. The adjacent coordinates are those that differ by at most 1 in either the x or y direction.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find all adjacent coordinates for a given coordinate (x, y), we need to consider all combinations of x and y where each can be either the same, one less, or one more than the given coordinate. This results in a 3x3 grid centered on (x, y). We will generate these coordinates and return them as a list of lists.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function get_coordinates that takes a tuple (x, y)\n   Initialize an empty list to store adjacent coordinates\n   For each dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n       For each dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n           Calculate new_x as x + dx\n           Calculate new_y as y + dy\n           Append [new_x, new_y] to the list of adjacent coordinates\n   Return the list of adjacent coordinates\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef get_coordinates(coord: tuple) -> list:\n    # Unpack the input tuple into x and y\n    x, y = coord\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the adjacent coordinates\n    adjacent_coords = []\n    # Iterate over the range [-1, 0, 1] for both x and y to cover all adjacent positions\n    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            # Calculate the new coordinates by adding dx and dy to x and y\n            new_x = x + dx\n            new_y = y + dy\n            # Append the new coordinate as a list to the adjacent_coords list\n            adjacent_coords.append([new_x, new_y])\n    # Return the list of adjacent coordinates\n    return adjacent_coords\n```\n\nThis code will generate all the coordinates in a 3x3 grid centered around the given coordinate, including the coordinate itself, and return them as a list of lists.",
