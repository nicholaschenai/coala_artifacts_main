    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple where the first element is the second number and the second element is the first number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The solution involves creating a function that accepts two parameters. Inside the function, we will create a tuple with the second parameter as the first element and the first parameter as the second element. Finally, we return this tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named swap_numbers that takes two parameters, num1 and num2.\n   Inside the function, create a tuple with the elements (num2, num1).\n   Return the created tuple.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\n# Define the function swap_numbers with two parameters\ndef swap_numbers(num1: int, num2: int) -> tuple:\n    # Create a tuple with the second number first and the first number second\n    result = (num2, num1)\n    # Return the tuple\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take two integers as input and return a tuple with their positions swapped, as required by the problem statement.",
