        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The median is the middle value in a list of numbers. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Since both lists are sorted and of the same size, we can merge them into a single sorted list.\n2. Once we have the merged sorted list, we can find the median.\n3. If the total number of elements in the merged list is odd, the median is the middle element.\n4. If the total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize two pointers, one for each list.\n2. Create an empty list to store the merged elements.\n3. While both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists:\n   - Compare the elements at the current pointers.\n   - Append the smaller element to the merged list and move the corresponding pointer forward.\n4. If there are remaining elements in either list, append them to the merged list.\n5. Calculate the median:\n   - If the length of the merged list is odd, return the middle element.\n   - If the length is even, return the average of the two middle elements.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef get_median(arr1, arr2, n):\n    # Initialize pointers for both arrays\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    # This will store the merged array\n    merged = []\n    \n    # Merge the two arrays\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:\n            merged.append(arr1[i])\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            merged.append(arr2[j])\n            j += 1\n    \n    # If there are remaining elements in arr1\n    while i < n:\n        merged.append(arr1[i])\n        i += 1\n    \n    # If there are remaining elements in arr2\n    while j < n:\n        merged.append(arr2[j])\n        j += 1\n    \n    # Calculate the median\n    total_length = 2 * n\n    if total_length % 2 == 1:\n        # Odd length, return the middle element\n        return float(merged[total_length // 2])\n    else:\n        # Even length, return the average of the two middle elements\n        mid1 = total_length // 2 - 1\n        mid2 = total_length // 2\n        return (merged[mid1] + merged[mid2]) / 2.0\n\n# Example usage\nassert get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0\n```\n\nThis code merges the two sorted lists and then calculates the median of the merged list. The merging process ensures that the final list is sorted, allowing us to easily find the median."

The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:\n    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.\n    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.\n    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.\n    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n            subarray_sums = []\n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n            subarray_sums.sort()\n            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])\n            return result % (10**9 + 7)\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
