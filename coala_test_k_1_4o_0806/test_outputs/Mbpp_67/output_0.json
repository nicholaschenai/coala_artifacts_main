    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the Bell number for a given integer `n`. The Bell number represents the number of ways to partition a set of `n` elements.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The Bell numbers can be calculated using a triangular array known as the Bell triangle. The first element of the first row is 1. Each subsequent row starts with the last element of the previous row. Each element in a row is the sum of the element to the left and the element above it in the previous row. The Bell number for `n` is the first element of the `n`-th row.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function bell_number(n):\n       Create a 2D list `bell` with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1) initialized to 0\n       Set bell[0][0] = 1\n       \n       For i from 1 to n:\n           Set bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]\n           For j from 1 to i:\n               Set bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]\n       \n       Return bell[n][0]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef bell_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Create a 2D list `bell` with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1) initialized to 0\n    bell = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    # The first Bell number is 1\n    bell[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the Bell triangle\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        # The first element of each row is the last element of the previous row\n        bell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]\n        \n        # Fill the rest of the row\n        for j in range(1, i+1):\n            bell[i][j] = bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]\n    \n    # The Bell number for n is the first element of the n-th row\n    return bell[n][0]\n```",
