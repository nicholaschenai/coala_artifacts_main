        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nThe problem asks us to find the number of ways to partition a set of size `n` using Bell numbers. The Bell number for a given `n` represents the number of different ways to partition a set of `n` elements into non-empty subsets.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Bell Numbers**: Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that represent the number of ways to partition a set. For example, the Bell number for `n=0` is `1` (the empty set), for `n=1` is `1` (one element can only be in one subset), for `n=2` is `2` (either both elements are in one subset or each element is in its own subset), and so on.\n\n2. **Recursive Formula**: Bell numbers can be calculated using a recursive formula:\n   - \\( B(n+1) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} B(k) \\)\n   - This means the Bell number for `n+1` is the sum of combinations of `n` taken `k` at a time multiplied by the Bell number of `k`.\n\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We can calculate Bell numbers iteratively using a table (or list) to store previously calculated Bell numbers to avoid redundant calculations.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize a list `bell` with the first Bell number `B(0) = 1`.\n2. For each number from `1` to `n`:\n   - Initialize a temporary list `current` to store the Bell numbers for the current `n`.\n   - Set the first element of `current` to the last element of `bell`.\n   - For each `j` from `1` to `i` (where `i` is the current number):\n     - Calculate the current Bell number using the formula: `current[j] = current[j-1] + bell[j-1]`.\n   - Append the last element of `current` to `bell`.\n3. Return the last element of `bell` which is `B(n)`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef bell_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the list with the first Bell number\n    bell = [1]\n    \n    # Calculate Bell numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Initialize the current row with the first element\n        current = [bell[-1]]\n        \n        # Fill the current row using the previous row\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            current.append(current[j - 1] + bell[j - 1])\n        \n        # Append the last element of the current row to the bell list\n        bell.append(current[-1])\n    \n    # Return the nth Bell number\n    return bell[n]\n```\n\nThis code calculates the Bell number for a given `n` using an iterative approach, storing intermediate results to efficiently compute the desired Bell number."

The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\n    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.\n\n    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. \n\n    Here is the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            steps = 0\n            while n != 1:\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    n //= 2\n                else:\n                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                        n -= 1\n                    else:\n                        n += 1\n                steps += 1\n            return steps\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The first element of the first row is 1. Each subsequent row starts with the last element of the previous row. Each element in a row is the sum of the element to the left and the element above it in the previous row.
