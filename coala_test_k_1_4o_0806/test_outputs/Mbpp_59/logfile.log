### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the nth octagonal number. An octagonal number is a figurate number that represents an octagon. The formula to find the nth octagonal number is given by:

\[ O_n = n \times (3n - 2) \]

where \( n \) is the position in the sequence of octagonal numbers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Formula**: The nth octagonal number can be calculated using the formula \( O_n = n \times (3n - 2) \).
2. **Implement the Formula**: Use the formula directly in the function to compute the nth octagonal number.
3. **Return the Result**: Return the computed octagonal number.

### Pseudocode

```
function is_octagonal(n):
    return n * (3 * n - 2)
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def is_octagonal(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth octagonal number using the formula
    # O_n = n * (3n - 2)
    return n * (3 * n - 2)
```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:

    1. **Formula Derivation**:
       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.

    2. **Handling the First Term**:
       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.

    3. **Efficiency**:
       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.

    4. **Code Simplicity**:
       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.

    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.
