    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes an IP address as a string and removes any leading zeros from each of its segments. The IP address is in the format of four decimal numbers separated by dots.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Split the IP address string into its four segments using the dot as a delimiter.\n   - For each segment, convert it to an integer to automatically remove any leading zeros.\n   - Convert each integer back to a string.\n   - Join the segments back together with dots to form the cleaned IP address.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function removezero_ip(ip_address):\n       split the ip_address by '.' to get a list of segments\n       for each segment in the list:\n           convert the segment to an integer to remove leading zeros\n           convert the integer back to a string\n       join the list of segments with '.' to form the cleaned IP address\n       return the cleaned IP address\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip_address: str) -> str:\n    # Split the IP address into segments\n    segments = ip_address.split('.')\n    \n    # Remove leading zeros by converting each segment to an integer and back to a string\n    cleaned_segments = [str(int(segment)) for segment in segments]\n    \n    # Join the cleaned segments with '.' to form the cleaned IP address\n    cleaned_ip_address = '.'.join(cleaned_segments)\n    \n    return cleaned_ip_address\n```\n\nThis solution effectively removes leading zeros from each segment of the IP address by leveraging the conversion to and from integers, which naturally strips any leading zeros.",
