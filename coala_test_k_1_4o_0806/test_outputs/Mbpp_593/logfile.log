INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/593 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes an IP address as a string input and removes any leading zeros from each of its segments. An IP address is typically represented in the format "x.x.x.x", where each "x" is a number between 0 and 255. The task is to ensure that each segment of the IP address does not have any leading zeros.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Split the IP address string into its four segments using the period ('.') as a delimiter.
   - For each segment, convert it to an integer to automatically remove any leading zeros.
   - Convert each integer back to a string.
   - Join the segments back together with periods to form the corrected IP address.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function removezero_ip(ip_address):
       split the ip_address by '.'
       for each segment in the split result:
           convert the segment to an integer (this removes leading zeros)
           convert the integer back to a string
       join the segments with '.' to form the new IP address
       return the new IP address
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def removezero_ip(ip_address: str) -> str:
    # Split the IP address into its segments
    segments = ip_address.split('.')
    
    # Process each segment to remove leading zeros
    processed_segments = []
    for segment in segments:
        # Convert to integer to remove leading zeros, then back to string
        processed_segment = str(int(segment))
        processed_segments.append(processed_segment)
    
    # Join the processed segments back into a single IP address string
    return '.'.join(processed_segments)
```

This solution effectively removes leading zeros from each segment of the IP address by leveraging the conversion to an integer, which inherently strips any leading zeros. The segments are then reassembled into a valid IP address format.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        I started this as a joke among friends, telling that converting numbers to other integer bases is for n00bs, while an actual coder at least converts numbers to more complex bases like [pi (or Ï€ or however you wish to spell it in your language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi), so they dared me proving I was better.

        And I did it in few hours, discovering that what I started as a joke actually has [some math ground and application (particularly the conversion to base pi, it seems)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-integer_representation).

        That said, now I am daring you to do the same, that is to build a function so that it takes a **number** (any number, you are warned!) and optionally the **number of decimals** (default: 0) and a **base** (default: pi), returning the proper conversion **as a string**:

        #Note
        In Java there is no easy way with optional parameters so all three parameters will be given; the same in C# because, as of now, the used version is not known. 

        ```python
        converter(13) #returns '103'
        converter(13,3) #returns '103.010'
        converter(-13,0,2) #returns '-1101'
        ```

        I know most of the world uses a comma as a [decimal mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark), but as English language and culture are *de facto* the Esperanto of us coders, we will stick to our common glorious traditions and uses, adopting the trivial dot (".") as decimal separator; if the absolute value of the result is <1, you have of course to put one (and only one) leading 0 before the decimal separator.

        Finally, you may assume that decimals if provided will always be >= 0 and that no test base will be smaller than 2 (because, you know, converting to base 1 is pretty lame) or greater than 36; as usual, for digits greater than 9 you can use uppercase alphabet letter, so your base of numeration is going to be: '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.

        That is my first 3-languages-kata, so I count on you all to give me extensive feedback, no matter how harsh it may sound, so to improve myself even further :)

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           The task is to create a function that converts a given number into a string representation in a specified base. The base can be a non-integer, such as Ï€ (pi), and the function should also handle negative numbers. The function should allow for an optional number of decimal places in the result. The default base is Ï€, and the default number of decimal places is 0. The function should return the result as a string, using a dot as the decimal separator.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Handle both integer and fractional parts of the number separately.
           - For the integer part, repeatedly divide the number by the base and record the remainders. These remainders represent the digits in the new base.
           - For the fractional part, multiply the fractional part by the base repeatedly to determine the digits after the decimal point.
           - Use a character set '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' to represent digits in bases up to 36.
           - Combine the integer and fractional parts into a single string, ensuring the correct placement of the decimal point.
           - Handle negative numbers by adding a '-' sign at the beginning of the result.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function converter(n, decimals=0, base=pi):
               if n is negative:
                   set is_negative to True
                   make n positive
               else:
                   set is_negative to False

               initialize integer_part as empty string
               initialize fractional_part as empty string

               while n is greater than or equal to base:
                   calculate remainder of n divided by base
                   prepend the character corresponding to remainder to integer_part
                   update n to be the integer division of n by base

               prepend the character corresponding to n to integer_part

               if decimals is greater than 0:
                   set fractional_part to '.'
                   set fractional_value to n - integer part of n
                   for i from 0 to decimals:
                       multiply fractional_value by base
                       set digit to integer part of fractional_value
                       append the character corresponding to digit to fractional_part
                       update fractional_value to fractional_value minus digit

               if is_negative:
                   prepend '-' to integer_part

               return integer_part + fractional_part
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        def converter(n, decimals=0, base=3.141592653589793):
            # Check if the number is negative
            is_negative = n < 0
            if is_negative:
                n = -n  # Work with the absolute value

            # Characters for digits in bases up to 36
            digits = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    
            # Convert the integer part
            integer_part = ''
            integer_value = int(n)
            while integer_value >= base:
                remainder = integer_value % base
                integer_part = digits[int(remainder)] + integer_part
                integer_value = integer_value // base
            integer_part = digits[int(integer_value)] + integer_part

            # Convert the fractional part
            fractional_part = ''
            if decimals > 0:
                fractional_part = '.'
                fractional_value = n - int(n)
                for _ in range(decimals):
                    fractional_value *= base
                    digit = int(fractional_value)
                    fractional_part += digits[digit]
                    fractional_value -= digit

            # Combine integer and fractional parts
            result = integer_part + fractional_part

            # Add negative sign if the original number was negative
            if is_negative:
                result = '-' + result

            return result
        ```

        This solution handles the conversion of both integer and fractional parts of a number to a specified base, including non-integer bases like Ï€, and formats the result as a string.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/593 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes an IP address as a string and removes any leading zeros from each of its segments. The IP address is in the format of four decimal numbers separated by dots.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will:
   - Split the IP address string into its four segments using the dot as a delimiter.
   - For each segment, convert it to an integer to automatically remove any leading zeros.
   - Convert each integer back to a string.
   - Join the segments back together with dots to form the cleaned IP address.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function removezero_ip(ip_address):
       split the ip_address by '.' to get a list of segments
       for each segment in the list:
           convert the segment to an integer to remove leading zeros
           convert the integer back to a string
       join the list of segments with '.' to form the cleaned IP address
       return the cleaned IP address
