        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes an IP address as a string input and removes any leading zeros from each of its segments. An IP address is typically represented in the format \"x.x.x.x\", where each \"x\" is a number between 0 and 255. The task is to ensure that each segment of the IP address does not have any leading zeros.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Split the IP address string into its four segments using the period ('.') as a delimiter.\n   - For each segment, convert it to an integer to automatically remove any leading zeros.\n   - Convert each integer back to a string.\n   - Join the segments back together with periods to form the corrected IP address.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function removezero_ip(ip_address):\n       split the ip_address by '.'\n       for each segment in the split result:\n           convert the segment to an integer (this removes leading zeros)\n           convert the integer back to a string\n       join the segments with '.' to form the new IP address\n       return the new IP address\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip_address: str) -> str:\n    # Split the IP address into its segments\n    segments = ip_address.split('.')\n    \n    # Process each segment to remove leading zeros\n    processed_segments = []\n    for segment in segments:\n        # Convert to integer to remove leading zeros, then back to string\n        processed_segment = str(int(segment))\n        processed_segments.append(processed_segment)\n    \n    # Join the processed segments back into a single IP address string\n    return '.'.join(processed_segments)\n```\n\nThis solution effectively removes leading zeros from each segment of the IP address by leveraging the conversion to an integer, which inherently strips any leading zeros. The segments are then reassembled into a valid IP address format."

The base can be a non-integer, such as \u03c0 (pi), and the function should also handle negative numbers. The function should allow for an optional number of decimal places in the result. The default base is \u03c0, and the default number of decimal places is 0. The function should return the result as a string, using a dot as the decimal separator.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we need to:\n           - Handle both integer and fractional parts of the number separately.\n           - For the integer part, repeatedly divide the number by the base and record the remainders. These remainders represent the digits in the new base.\n           - For the fractional part, multiply the fractional part by the base repeatedly to determine the digits after the decimal point.\n           - Use a character set '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' to represent digits in bases up to 36.\n           - Combine the integer and fractional parts into a single string, ensuring the correct placement of the decimal point.\n           - Handle negative numbers by adding a '-' sign at the beginning of the result.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function converter(n, decimals=0, base=pi):\n               if n is negative:\n                   set is_negative to True\n                   make n positive\n               else:\n                   set is_negative to False\n\n               initialize integer_part as empty string\n               initialize fractional_part as empty string\n\n               while n is greater than or equal to base:\n                   calculate remainder of n divided by base\n                   prepend the character corresponding to remainder to integer_part\n                   update n to be the integer division of n by base\n\n               prepend the character corresponding to n to integer_part\n\n               if decimals is greater than 0:\n                   set fractional_part to '.'\n                   set fractional_value to n - integer part of n\n                   for i from 0 to decimals:\n                       multiply fractional_value by base\n                       set digit to integer part of fractional_value\n                       append the character corresponding to digit to fractional_part\n                       update fractional_value to fractional_value minus digit\n\n               if is_negative:\n                   prepend '-' to integer_part\n\n               return integer_part + fractional_part\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        def converter(n, decimals=0, base=3.141592653589793):\n            # Check if the number is negative\n            is_negative = n < 0\n            if is_negative:\n                n = -n  # Work with the absolute value\n\n            # Characters for digits in bases up to 36\n            digits = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n    \n            # Convert the integer part\n            integer_part = ''\n            integer_value = int(n)\n            while integer_value >= base:\n                remainder = integer_value % base\n                integer_part = digits[int(remainder)] + integer_part\n                integer_value = integer_value // base\n            integer_part = digits[int(integer_value)] + integer_part\n\n            # Convert the fractional part\n            fractional_part = ''\n            if decimals > 0:\n                fractional_part = '.'\n                fractional_value = n - int(n)\n                for _ in range(decimals):\n                    fractional_value *= base\n                    digit = int(fractional_value)\n                    fractional_part += digits[digit]\n                    fractional_value -= digit\n\n            # Combine integer and fractional parts\n            result = integer_part + fractional_part\n\n            # Add negative sign if the original number was negative\n            if is_negative:\n                result = '-' + result\n\n            return result\n        ```\n\n        This solution handles the conversion of both integer and fractional parts of a number to a specified base, including non-integer bases like \u03c0, and formats the result as a string.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [13, 0, 8] Output: ['15']\n         Input: [10, 0, 16] Output: ['A']\n         Input: [10000, 4, 13] Output: ['4723.0000']\n         Input: [7, 0, 19] Output: ['7']\n         Input: [13.5, 4, 16] Output: ['D.8000']\n         Input: [10.81, 0, 16] Output: ['A']\n         Input: [1, 2, 2] Output: ['1.00']\n         Input: [-10, 0, 23] Output: ['-A']\n         Input: [0, 4, 26] Output: ['0.0000']\n         Input: [-15.5, 2, 23] Output: ['-F.BB']\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: [13] Expected output: ['103'] # Execution output: 100\n         Input: [10] Expected output: ['100'] # Execution output: 30\n         Input: [13, 3] Expected output: ['103.010'] # Execution output: 100.000\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Failure\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
