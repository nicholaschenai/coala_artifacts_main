INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/88 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a dictionary. This dictionary should contain each unique number from the list as keys and the number of times each number appears in the list as their corresponding values.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each element in the list.
   - We will use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each element.
   - For each element, if it is already in the dictionary, we will increment its count by 1.
   - If the element is not in the dictionary, we will add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.
   - Finally, we will return the dictionary containing the frequencies of all elements.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function freq_count that takes a list as input
       Initialize an empty dictionary called frequency_dict
       For each element in the list:
           If the element is already a key in frequency_dict:
               Increment the value associated with that key by 1
           Else:
               Add the element as a key to frequency_dict with a value of 1
       Return frequency_dict
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def freq_count(lst):
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store frequencies
    frequency_dict = {}
    
    # Iterate over each element in the list
    for element in lst:
        # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if element in frequency_dict:
            frequency_dict[element] += 1
        # If the element is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
        else:
            frequency_dict[element] = 1
    
    # Return the dictionary containing frequencies of all elements
    return frequency_dict
```

This code will correctly compute the frequency of each element in the input list and return the result as a dictionary.

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.
    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.

    ### Strategy:
    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.
    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.
    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            prefix_sums = {0: 1}
            current_sum = 0
            count = 0
        
            for num in nums:
                current_sum += num
                needed_sum = current_sum - k
                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:
                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]
                if current_sum in prefix_sums:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
                else:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1
        
            return count
    ```

    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.
