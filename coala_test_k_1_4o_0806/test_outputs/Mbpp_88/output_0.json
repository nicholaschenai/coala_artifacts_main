    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a dictionary. This dictionary should contain each unique number from the list as a key, and the number of times that number appears in the list as the corresponding value.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and keep track of how many times each number appears. We can use a dictionary to store this information, where the keys are the numbers from the list and the values are their respective counts. As we go through each number in the list, we check if it is already in the dictionary. If it is, we increment its count. If it is not, we add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function freq_count that takes a list as input\n       Create an empty dictionary called frequency_dict\n       For each element in the list:\n           If the element is already a key in frequency_dict:\n               Increment the value associated with that key by 1\n           Else:\n               Add the element as a key to frequency_dict with a value of 1\n       Return frequency_dict\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef freq_count(lst):\n    # Create an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each element\n    frequency_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if element in frequency_dict:\n            frequency_dict[element] += 1\n        # If the element is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1\n        else:\n            frequency_dict[element] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing the frequency of each element\n    return frequency_dict\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the frequency of each element in the list and return the result as a dictionary.",
