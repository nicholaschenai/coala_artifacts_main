    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine if a given list of integers contains consecutive numbers. Consecutive numbers are numbers that follow each other in order, without any gaps. For example, the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` contains consecutive numbers, but `[1, 3, 4, 5]` does not because there is a gap between 1 and 3.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To check if a list contains consecutive numbers, we can follow these steps:\n   - First, find the minimum and maximum numbers in the list.\n   - Calculate the expected length of a list that contains all numbers from the minimum to the maximum (inclusive). This length should be `max - min + 1`.\n   - Check if the length of the list is equal to this expected length.\n   - Additionally, ensure that all numbers between the minimum and maximum are present in the list by converting the list to a set and comparing its size to the expected length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function check_Consecutive(numbers):\n       if the list is empty:\n           return False\n       find the minimum number in the list\n       find the maximum number in the list\n       calculate the expected length as max - min + 1\n       convert the list to a set to remove duplicates\n       if the size of the set is equal to the expected length:\n           return True\n       else:\n           return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_Consecutive(numbers):\n    # If the list is empty, it cannot contain consecutive numbers\n    if not numbers:\n        return False\n    \n    # Find the minimum and maximum numbers in the list\n    min_num = min(numbers)\n    max_num = max(numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the expected length of a consecutive sequence\n    expected_length = max_num - min_num + 1\n    \n    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates\n    unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n    \n    # Check if the size of the set matches the expected length\n    return len(unique_numbers) == expected_length\n```\n\nThis solution checks if the list contains consecutive numbers by ensuring that the range from the minimum to the maximum number is fully covered by the elements in the list, without any duplicates.",
