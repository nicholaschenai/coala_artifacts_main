INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/256 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the count of prime numbers that are less than this input number.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - To find the number of prime numbers less than a given number `n`, we can iterate through all numbers from 2 to `n-1` and check if each number is prime.
   - To check if a number `k` is prime, we can test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `k`. If `k` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.
   - Count each prime number found and return the total count.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Define function is_prime(number):
       If number is less than 2, return False
       For each integer i from 2 to the square root of number:
           If number is divisible by i, return False
       Return True

   Define function count_Primes_nums(n):
       Initialize prime_count to 0
       For each integer num from 2 to n-1:
           If is_prime(num) is True:
               Increment prime_count by 1
       Return prime_count
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_prime(number: int) -> bool:
    # A number less than 2 is not prime
    if number < 2:
        return False
    # Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number
    for i in range(2, int(number**0.5) + 1):
        if number % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_Primes_nums(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the count of prime numbers
    prime_count = 0
    # Iterate over each number from 2 to n-1
    for num in range(2, n):
        # Check if the current number is prime
        if is_prime(num):
            # Increment the prime count if it is prime
            prime_count += 1
    # Return the total count of prime numbers found
    return prime_count
```

This solution defines a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime and uses it within the main function `count_Primes_nums` to count all prime numbers less than the given input `n`.

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.
