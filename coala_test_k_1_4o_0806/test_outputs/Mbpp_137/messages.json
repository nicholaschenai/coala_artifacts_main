The function should return this ratio as a floating-point number.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Count Zeroes**: Traverse the list and count how many elements are zero.\n2. **Count Non-Zeroes**: Calculate the number of non-zero elements by subtracting the count of zeroes from the total number of elements in the list.\n3. **Calculate Ratio**: Compute the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes. If there are no non-zero elements, handle this case to avoid division by zero.\n4. **Return the Ratio**: Return the calculated ratio as a floating-point number.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction zero_count(arr):\n    zero_count = 0\n    for each element in arr:\n        if element is zero:\n            increment zero_count\n    non_zero_count = length of arr - zero_count\n    if non_zero_count is zero:\n        return 0.0\n    else:\n        return zero_count / non_zero_count\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef zero_count(arr):\n    # Initialize the count of zeroes\n    zero_count = 0\n    \n    # Count the number of zeroes in the array\n    for num in arr:\n        if num == 0:\n            zero_count += 1\n    \n    # Calculate the number of non-zero elements\n    non_zero_count = len(arr) - zero_count\n    \n    # If there are no non-zero elements, return 0.0 to avoid division by zero\n    if non_zero_count == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    \n    # Calculate and return the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes\n    return zero_count / non_zero_count\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list to count zeroes, calculates the number of non-zero elements, and then computes the ratio. It handles the edge case where there are no non-zero elements by returning 0.0."

The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.\n    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.\n    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countDivisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        i = 1\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n            i += 1\n        return count\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            A = int(data[index])\n            B = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            diff = abs(A - B)\n        \n            if diff == 0:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                results.append(countDivisors(diff))\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
