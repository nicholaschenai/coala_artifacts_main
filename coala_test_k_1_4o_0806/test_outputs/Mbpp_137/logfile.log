INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/137 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes in a given list of integers. The function should return this ratio as a floating-point number.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Count Zeroes**: Traverse the list and count how many elements are zero.
2. **Count Non-Zeroes**: Calculate the number of non-zero elements by subtracting the count of zeroes from the total number of elements in the list.
3. **Calculate Ratio**: Compute the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes. If there are no non-zero elements, handle this case to avoid division by zero.
4. **Return the Ratio**: Return the calculated ratio as a floating-point number.

### Pseudocode

```
function zero_count(arr):
    zero_count = 0
    for each element in arr:
        if element is zero:
            increment zero_count
    non_zero_count = length of arr - zero_count
    if non_zero_count is zero:
        return 0.0
    else:
        return zero_count / non_zero_count
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def zero_count(arr):
    # Initialize the count of zeroes
    zero_count = 0
    
    # Count the number of zeroes in the array
    for num in arr:
        if num == 0:
            zero_count += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of non-zero elements
    non_zero_count = len(arr) - zero_count
    
    # If there are no non-zero elements, return 0.0 to avoid division by zero
    if non_zero_count == 0:
        return 0.0
    
    # Calculate and return the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes
    return zero_count / non_zero_count
```

This solution iterates through the list to count zeroes, calculates the number of non-zero elements, and then computes the ratio. It handles the edge case where there are no non-zero elements by returning 0.0.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.
