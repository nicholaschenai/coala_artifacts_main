INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/427 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a date string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" and converts it to the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The input is a string representing a date in the format "yyyy-mm-dd".
   - We need to split this string into its components: year, month, and day.
   - Rearrange these components to form a new string in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".
   - Return the newly formatted date string.

### Pseudocode Solution

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `change_date_format` that takes a single string argument `date`.
   - Split the input string `date` using the hyphen '-' as the delimiter. This will give us a list with three elements: year, month, and day.
   - Rearrange the elements of the list to form a new string in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".
   - Return the newly formatted string.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def change_date_format(date: str) -> str:
    # Split the input date string by the '-' delimiter
    parts = date.split('-')
    
    # Rearrange the parts to form the new date format "dd-mm-yyyy"
    new_date = f"{parts[2]}-{parts[1]}-{parts[0]}"
    
    # Return the newly formatted date string
    return new_date
```

This function will take a date string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd", split it into its components, rearrange them, and return the date in the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Binary Reversal Logic**: Both my solution and the official solution correctly identified the need to reverse the binary representation of indices. The official solution uses a loop to construct the reversed binary string, which is a straightforward approach. My solution used Python's string manipulation capabilities to achieve the same result, which is more concise.

    2. **Index Conversion**: The official solution directly constructs the reversed binary string and converts it back to an integer. This is similar to my approach, where I used Python's `format` and slicing to reverse the binary string. Both methods are effective, but the official solution's loop-based approach might be more intuitive for those less familiar with Python's string manipulation functions.

    3. **Message Rearrangement**: Both solutions correctly rearrange the message based on the reversed indices. The official solution uses a list to store the rearranged message, which is then joined into a string for output. This is similar to my approach, where I also used a list to build the scrambled message.

    4. **Efficiency and Clarity**: The official solution is efficient and clear, using basic operations to achieve the desired result. My solution is also efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for binary conversion and string manipulation. Both solutions have similar time complexity, as they both iterate over the message and perform constant-time operations for each character.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively addressed the task. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding binary manipulation and how reversing binary strings can be used to solve indexing problems.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/427 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a date string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd" and converts it to the format "dd-mm-yyyy".

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can split the input date string by the hyphen ("-") to separate the year, month, and day. Once we have these components, we can rearrange them in the order of day, month, and year, and then join them back together with hyphens to form the new date format.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   - Define a function `change_date_format` that takes a string `date` as input.
   - Split the input string `date` using the hyphen ("-") as the delimiter. This will give us a list with three elements: year, month, and day.
   - Rearrange the elements of the list to the order: day, month, year.
   - Join the rearranged elements with hyphens to form the new date string.
