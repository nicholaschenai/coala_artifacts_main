The sequence is defined recursively with the first two numbers as 1, and each subsequent number is determined by the values of the previous numbers in the sequence.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The Newman-Conway sequence is defined as follows:\n   - P(1) = 1\n   - P(2) = 1\n   - For n > 2, P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n-P(n-1))\n\n   To find the nth number in this sequence, we can use a list to store the sequence values up to n. We initialize the first two values as 1, and then use the recursive formula to compute each subsequent value up to n.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function sequence(n):\n       if n == 1 or n == 2:\n           return 1\n       create a list seq with n+1 elements, initialized to 0\n       set seq[1] = 1\n       set seq[2] = 1\n       for i from 3 to n:\n           seq[i] = seq[seq[i-1]] + seq[i-seq[i-1]]\n       return seq[n]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sequence(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base cases for the sequence\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize a list to store the sequence values\n    seq = [0] * (n + 1)\n    seq[1] = 1\n    seq[2] = 1\n    \n    # Compute the sequence values from 3 to n\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        seq[i] = seq[seq[i - 1]] + seq[i - seq[i - 1]]\n    \n    # Return the nth value in the sequence\n    return seq[n]\n```",
