INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/84 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence. The sequence is defined as follows:
   - P(1) = 1
   - P(2) = 1
   - For n > 2, P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n-P(n-1))

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence:
   - Start by defining the first two numbers of the sequence as 1.
   - For any number greater than 2, use the recursive formula to calculate the sequence value.
   - Store the sequence values in a list to avoid recalculating them multiple times.
   - Return the nth value from the list.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function sequence(n):
       if n == 1 or n == 2:
           return 1
       create a list seq with n+1 elements initialized to 0
       set seq[1] = 1
       set seq[2] = 1
       for i from 3 to n:
           seq[i] = seq[seq[i-1]] + seq[i-seq[i-1]]
       return seq[n]
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sequence(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases for the sequence
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize a list to store sequence values, with n+1 elements
    seq = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Set the first two known values of the sequence
    seq[1] = 1
    seq[2] = 1
    
    # Calculate the sequence values from 3 to n
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        seq[i] = seq[seq[i - 1]] + seq[i - seq[i - 1]]
    
    # Return the nth value in the sequence
    return seq[n]
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.

    ### Strategy:
    - I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.
    - This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).

    ### Implementation:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/84 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the nth number in the Newman-Conway sequence. The sequence is defined recursively with the first two numbers as 1, and each subsequent number is determined by the values of the previous numbers in the sequence.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The Newman-Conway sequence is defined as follows:
   - P(1) = 1
   - P(2) = 1
   - For n > 2, P(n) = P(P(n-1)) + P(n-P(n-1))

   To find the nth number in this sequence, we can use a list to store the sequence values up to n. We initialize the first two values as 1, and then use the recursive formula to compute each subsequent value up to n.
