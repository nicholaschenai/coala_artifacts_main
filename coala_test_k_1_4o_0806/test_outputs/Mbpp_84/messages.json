The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.\n    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.\n    - This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).\n\n    ### Implementation:\n    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.\n    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
