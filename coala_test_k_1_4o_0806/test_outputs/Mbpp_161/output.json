    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes two lists as input. The function should remove all elements from the first list that are present in the second list and return the modified first list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the first list and check each element to see if it is present in the second list. If an element is found in the second list, we skip it; otherwise, we include it in the result. This way, we build a new list that contains only the elements from the first list that are not in the second list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function remove_elements(list1, list2):\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each element in list1:\n           If the element is not in list2:\n               Append the element to result\n       Return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    # Iterate over each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not present in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not present, add it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    # Return the result list which contains elements not in the second list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will iterate through `list1`, check each element against `list2`, and build a new list `result` that contains only those elements from `list1` that are not in `list2`.",
