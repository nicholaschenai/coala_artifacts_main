The function should return a new list that contains only the elements from the first list that are not present in the second list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate through each element in the first list.\n   - For each element, we will check if it is present in the second list.\n   - If the element is not in the second list, we will add it to a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return this new list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function remove_elements(list1, list2):\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each element in list1:\n           If the element is not in list2:\n               Append the element to result\n       Return result\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not, append it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    \n    # Return the result list containing elements not in list2\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each element in `list1` and checks if it is not present in `list2`. If the element is not found in `list2`, it is added to the `result` list, which is returned at the end. This approach ensures that all elements from `list1` that are not in `list2` are included in the output list."

The core concepts involved handling different types of queries efficiently, including updating values, calculating sums, and finding maximum, minimum, second maximum, and second minimum values within specified ranges. The challenge was to ensure that each operation was performed correctly and efficiently, given the constraints.\n\n    The key strategy was to use a list to store the integers, allowing for direct access and updates. For operations like finding the second maximum or minimum, I used a set to handle unique values and sorted them to find the desired result. This approach ensured that the operations were both correct and efficient.\n\n    One potential pitfall was handling the indices correctly, as the input uses 1-based indexing while Python lists use 0-based indexing. Adjusting the indices appropriately was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors. Additionally, handling invalid operations and edge cases, such as when there are not enough unique values to find a second maximum or minimum, was important to ensure robustness.\n\n    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of careful index management and the use of sets for handling unique values in range-based operations. The solution was successful, passing all test cases without any errors.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The function should remove all elements from the first list that are present in the second list and return the modified first list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the first list and check each element to see if it is present in the second list. If an element is found in the second list, we skip it; otherwise, we include it in the result. This way, we build a new list that contains only the elements from the first list that are not in the second list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function remove_elements(list1, list2):\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each element in list1:\n           If the element is not in list2:\n               Append the element to result\n       Return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef remove_elements(list1, list2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    # Iterate over each element in the first list\n    for element in list1:\n        # Check if the element is not present in the second list\n        if element not in list2:\n            # If not present, add it to the result list\n            result.append(element)\n    # Return the result list which contains elements not in the second list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will iterate through `list1`, check each element against `list2`, and build a new list `result` that contains only those elements from `list1` that are not in `list2`."
