    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of even numbers that are located at even indices in a given list of integers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Iterate through the list of numbers.\n   - For each number, check if its index is even.\n   - If the index is even, check if the number itself is even.\n   - If both the index and the number are even, add the number to a running total.\n   - Return the total sum after iterating through the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0\n   For each index `i` and number `num` in the list:\n       If `i` is even:\n           If `num` is even:\n               Add `num` to `total_sum`\n   Return `total_sum`\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_and_even_index(numbers):\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the list with index and value\n    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):\n        # Check if the index is even\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # Check if the number is even\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                # Add the number to the total sum\n                total_sum += num\n    \n    # Return the total sum of even numbers at even indices\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the sum of even numbers located at even indices in the input list.",
