If one integer is positive and the other is negative, they have opposite signs.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To determine if two integers have opposite signs, we can use the property of multiplication. If two numbers have opposite signs, their product will be negative. Therefore, we can multiply the two integers and check if the result is less than zero. If it is, the integers have opposite signs.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `opposite_Signs` that takes two integers `a` and `b`.\n   - Multiply `a` and `b`.\n   - Check if the result of the multiplication is less than zero.\n   - If it is, return `True` (indicating opposite signs).\n   - Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef opposite_Signs(a: int, b: int) -> bool:\n    # Multiply the two integers\n    product = a * b\n    \n    # Check if the product is less than zero\n    # If it is, the integers have opposite signs\n    return product < 0\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if the two given integers have opposite signs by checking if their product is negative."

The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) given these constraints.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \\( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \\).\n    - **Area Formula**: The area \\( S \\) is given by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b = S \\).\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \\( b = \\frac{2S}{a} \\) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \\( a \\).\n    - **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.\n    - **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.\n    - **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.\n    - **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    import math\n\n    def find_triangle_sides():\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            H = int(data[index])\n            S = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            if 2 * S > H * H:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n                continue\n        \n            try:\n                discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S\n                if discriminant < 0:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                    continue\n            \n                a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n                a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n            \n                b1 = 2 * S / a1\n                b2 = 2 * S / a2\n            \n                if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n            except ValueError:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n    \n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    find_triangle_sides()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation and precision handling in computational geometry problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
