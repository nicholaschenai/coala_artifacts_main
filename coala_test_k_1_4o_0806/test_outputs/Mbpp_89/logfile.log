INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/89 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the closest smaller integer than `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**
   - The closest smaller number to any given integer `n` is simply `n - 1`. This is because subtracting 1 from any integer gives the next smallest integer.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `closest_num` that takes an integer `n` as input.
   - Return `n - 1`.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def closest_num(n: int) -> int:
    # Return the closest smaller number than n, which is n - 1
    return n - 1
```

This solution directly implements the logic that the closest smaller integer to `n` is `n - 1`.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.

    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.

    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. 

    Here is the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
            steps = 0
            while n != 1:
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    n //= 2
                else:
                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        n += 1
                steps += 1
            return steps
    ```
