The function should return a floating-point number that represents the volume.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   The formula to calculate the volume of a sphere is \\((4/3) \\times \\pi \\times r^3\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the sphere. We will implement a function that takes the radius as input, applies this formula, and returns the calculated volume. We will use Python's built-in constant `math.pi` for the value of \\(\\pi\\).\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   - Import the `math` module to access the value of \\(\\pi\\).\n   - Define a function `volume_sphere` that takes one parameter `radius`.\n   - Inside the function, calculate the volume using the formula \\((4/3) \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius}^3\\).\n   - Return the calculated volume.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef volume_sphere(radius: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula (4/3) * pi * radius^3\n    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `volume_sphere` that calculates and returns the volume of a sphere given its radius, using the mathematical formula for the volume of a sphere."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to convert a number into a specified base, with the default being \u03c0. The challenge was to handle both integer and fractional parts of the number and return the result as a string. The function needed to accommodate non-integer bases, which added complexity to the conversion process.\n\n    ### Core Concepts:\n    - **Base Conversion**: The problem required converting numbers to bases that could be non-integer, such as \u03c0. This involves handling both integer and fractional parts separately.\n    - **Handling Non-Integer Bases**: Unlike typical base conversions, non-integer bases require careful handling of division and modulus operations.\n\n    ### Strategies and Challenges:\n    - **Integer Part Conversion**: Initially, the conversion logic for the integer part was not correctly handling non-integer bases. The use of integer division and modulus operations needed to be adapted for non-integer bases.\n    - **Fractional Part Conversion**: Multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting digits worked well, but ensuring precision with the specified number of decimal places was crucial.\n\n    ### Errors and Fixes:\n    - **Incorrect Integer Conversion**: The main issue was with the integer part conversion when using non-integer bases. Adjusting the logic to correctly handle division and modulus operations for non-integer bases was key.\n    - **Zero Handling**: Ensuring that the integer part is represented as '0' when necessary was a simple but important fix.\n\n    ### Final Solution:\n    The final solution involved correctly adapting the conversion logic for non-integer bases and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts were handled accurately. The function now correctly converts numbers to the specified base, including non-integer bases like \u03c0, and formats the result as expected.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
