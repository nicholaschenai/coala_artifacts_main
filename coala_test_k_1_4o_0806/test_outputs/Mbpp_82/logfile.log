INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/82 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius. The function should return a floating-point number that represents the volume.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   The formula to calculate the volume of a sphere is \((4/3) \times \pi \times r^3\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. We will implement a function that takes the radius as input, applies this formula, and returns the calculated volume. We will use Python's built-in constant `math.pi` for the value of \(\pi\).

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   - Import the `math` module to access the value of \(\pi\).
   - Define a function `volume_sphere` that takes one parameter `radius`.
   - Inside the function, calculate the volume using the formula \((4/3) \times \pi \times \text{radius}^3\).
   - Return the calculated volume.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
import math

def volume_sphere(radius: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula (4/3) * pi * radius^3
    volume = (4/3) * math.pi * (radius ** 3)
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
```

This code defines a function `volume_sphere` that calculates and returns the volume of a sphere given its radius, using the mathematical formula for the volume of a sphere.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to convert a number into a specified base, with the default being Ï€. The challenge was to handle both integer and fractional parts of the number and return the result as a string. The function needed to accommodate non-integer bases, which added complexity to the conversion process.

    ### Core Concepts:
    - **Base Conversion**: The problem required converting numbers to bases that could be non-integer, such as Ï€. This involves handling both integer and fractional parts separately.
    - **Handling Non-Integer Bases**: Unlike typical base conversions, non-integer bases require careful handling of division and modulus operations.

    ### Strategies and Challenges:
    - **Integer Part Conversion**: Initially, the conversion logic for the integer part was not correctly handling non-integer bases. The use of integer division and modulus operations needed to be adapted for non-integer bases.
    - **Fractional Part Conversion**: Multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting digits worked well, but ensuring precision with the specified number of decimal places was crucial.

    ### Errors and Fixes:
    - **Incorrect Integer Conversion**: The main issue was with the integer part conversion when using non-integer bases. Adjusting the logic to correctly handle division and modulus operations for non-integer bases was key.
    - **Zero Handling**: Ensuring that the integer part is represented as '0' when necessary was a simple but important fix.

    ### Final Solution:
    The final solution involved correctly adapting the conversion logic for non-integer bases and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts were handled accurately. The function now correctly converts numbers to the specified base, including non-integer bases like Ï€, and formats the result as expected.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/82 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius. The function should return a value that is close to a specified result when the radius is 10.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   The volume of a sphere can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]
   where \( V \) is the volume and \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. We will implement this formula in a function. The function will take the radius as an input and return the calculated volume.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function volume_sphere with a parameter radius
       Calculate the volume using the formula (4/3) * Ï€ * radius^3
       Return the calculated volume
   ```

    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
