    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the median length of a trapezium (trapezoid) given the lengths of its three sides: the two parallel sides (bases) and the height. The median of a trapezium is the line segment that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides and is parallel to the bases. The length of the median is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the median length of a trapezium, we need to calculate the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases). This is done by adding the lengths of the two bases and dividing the sum by 2.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function median_trapezium(base1, base2, height):\n       Calculate the median length as (base1 + base2) / 2\n       Return the median length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef median_trapezium(base1: int, base2: int, height: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the median length of the trapezium\n    # The median is the average of the two parallel sides (bases)\n    median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2\n    # Return the median length\n    return median_length\n```\n\nThis function takes three integer inputs: `base1`, `base2`, and `height`. It calculates the median length of the trapezium by averaging the two bases and returns the result. The height is not used in the calculation of the median length.",
