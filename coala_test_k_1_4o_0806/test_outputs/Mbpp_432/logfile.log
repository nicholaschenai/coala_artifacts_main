INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/432 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the median length of a trapezium (trapezoid). The trapezium is defined by three lengths: the two parallel sides (bases) and the height. The median of a trapezium is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the median length of a trapezium, we need to:
   - Take the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases) as inputs.
   - Calculate the average of these two lengths.
   - Return this average as the median length of the trapezium.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function median_trapezium(base1, base2, height):
       calculate the average of base1 and base2
       return the average
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def median_trapezium(base1: int, base2: int, height: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the average of the two bases
    median_length = (base1 + base2) / 2
    # Return the median length as an integer
    return int(median_length)
```

This function takes three integer inputs: `base1`, `base2`, and `height`. It calculates the median length of the trapezium by averaging the two base lengths and returns the result as an integer. The height is not used in the calculation of the median length.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), the core concepts involved understanding the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \( a \) and \( b \) given these constraints.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).
    - **Area Formula**: The area \( S \) is given by \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \).

    ### Strategy:
    - **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \( a \).
    - **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.
    - **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.
    - **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.
    - **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    import sys
    import math

    def find_triangle_sides():
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            H = int(data[index])
            S = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            if 2 * S > H * H:
                results.append("-1")
                continue
        
            try:
                discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S
                if discriminant < 0:
                    results.append("-1")
                    continue
            
                a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
                a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
            
                b1 = 2 * S / a1
                b2 = 2 * S / a2
            
                if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:
                    results.append(f"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:
                    results.append(f"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                else:
                    results.append("-1")
            except ValueError:
                results.append("-1")
    
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation and precision handling in computational geometry problems.
