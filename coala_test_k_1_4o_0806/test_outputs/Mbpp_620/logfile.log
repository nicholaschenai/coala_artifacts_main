INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/620 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the size of the largest subset of a given list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in this subset is divisible by each other. In other words, for any two numbers `a` and `b` in the subset, either `a % b == 0` or `b % a == 0`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - First, sort the list of numbers. Sorting helps because if a number `a` is divisible by `b`, then `a` is usually greater than or equal to `b`.
   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the largest divisible subset ending at each element.
   - Initialize a list `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the element at index `i`.
   - For each element in the list, check all previous elements to see if they are divisible. If they are, update the `dp` value for the current element.
   - The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function largest_subset(nums):
       if nums is empty:
           return 0
       
       sort nums
       initialize dp array of size len(nums) with all 1s
       
       for i from 1 to len(nums) - 1:
           for j from 0 to i - 1:
               if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
       
       return max value in dp
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def largest_subset(nums):
    # If the list is empty, the largest subset size is 0
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the numbers to facilitate the divisibility check
    nums.sort()
    
    # Initialize the dp array where each element starts with a subset size of 1
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    
    # Iterate over each number in the sorted list
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        # Check all previous numbers to see if they divide the current number
        for j in range(i):
            # If nums[i] is divisible by nums[j], update the dp[i]
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    
    # The result is the maximum value in the dp array
    return max(dp)
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible, ensuring that the solution is both correct and optimal.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the task of finding the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an unsorted list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.

    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.

    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.

    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
            if not nums:
                return 0
        
            n = len(nums)
            d = [1] * n
        
            for i in range(1, n):
                for j in range(i):
                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
            return max(d)
    ```

    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.
