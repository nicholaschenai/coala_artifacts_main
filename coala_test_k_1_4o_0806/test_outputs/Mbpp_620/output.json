    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible by each other. In other words, for any two numbers `a` and `b` in the subset, either `a % b == 0` or `b % a == 0`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach. First, sort the list of numbers. This helps because if `a` divides `b`, then `a` is less than or equal to `b`. We will maintain a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with the element at index `i`. For each element, we will check all previous elements to see if they can form a divisible pair with the current element. If they can, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the answer will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function largest_subset(nums):\n       if nums is empty:\n           return 0\n       \n       sort nums\n       n = length of nums\n       dp = array of size n initialized to 1\n       \n       for i from 1 to n-1:\n           for j from 0 to i-1:\n               if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:\n                   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n       \n       return max value in dp\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef largest_subset(nums):\n    # If the list is empty, return 0 as there are no elements to form a subset\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Sort the numbers to ensure that if a divides b, then a <= b\n    nums.sort()\n    n = len(nums)\n    \n    # Initialize the dp array where each element is 1, as each number is a subset of itself\n    dp = [1] * n\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the sorted list\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # Check all previous numbers to see if they can form a divisible pair with nums[i]\n        for j in range(i):\n            # If nums[i] is divisible by nums[j], update dp[i]\n            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n    \n    # The result is the maximum value in the dp array, which represents the largest subset size\n    return max(dp)\n```",
