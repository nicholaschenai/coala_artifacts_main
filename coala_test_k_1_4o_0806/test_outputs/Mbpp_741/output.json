    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if all characters in a given string are the same. If all characters are the same, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if all characters in a string are the same, we can compare each character in the string to the first character. If any character is different from the first character, we return `False`. If we reach the end of the string without finding any differing characters, we return `True`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function all_Characters_Same(s):\n       If the string is empty, return True (since there are no differing characters)\n       Get the first character of the string\n       For each character in the string:\n           If the character is not equal to the first character:\n               Return False\n       Return True\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef all_Characters_Same(s: str) -> bool:\n    # If the string is empty, return True (no differing characters)\n    if not s:\n        return True\n    \n    # Get the first character of the string\n    first_char = s[0]\n    \n    # Check each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # If a character is different from the first character, return False\n        if char != first_char:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all characters are the same, return True\n    return True\n```",
