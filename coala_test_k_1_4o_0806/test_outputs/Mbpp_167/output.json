    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to a given integer `n`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`, we can start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1, and keep doubling it until it is greater than or equal to `n`. This approach works because powers of 2 grow exponentially, so we will quickly reach or exceed `n`.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function next_power_of_2(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 1\n       start with power = 1\n       while power is less than n:\n           double the power\n       return power\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef next_power_of_2(n: int) -> int:\n    # If n is 0, the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n is 1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1\n    power = 1\n    \n    # Double the power until it is greater than or equal to n\n    while power < n:\n        power *= 2\n    \n    # Return the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n\n    return power\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n` by starting from 1 and doubling until the condition is met.",
