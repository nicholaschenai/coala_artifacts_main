INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/167 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that finds the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to a given integer `n`. For example, if `n` is 0, the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 1 (since 2^0 = 1).

## Conceptual Solution

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` is 1.
2. If `n` is greater than 0, we need to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`. We can do this by starting with 1 (which is 2^0) and keep multiplying by 2 until the result is greater than or equal to `n`.

## Pseudocode

```
function next_power_of_2(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    power = 1
    while power < n:
        power = power * 2
    return power
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def next_power_of_2(n: int) -> int:
    # If n is less than or equal to 0, the smallest power of 2 is 1
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    
    # Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1 (2^0)
    power = 1
    
    # Keep multiplying by 2 until power is greater than or equal to n
    while power < n:
        power *= 2
    
    # Return the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n
    return power
```

    [Task]:
        Given an integer n, you must transform it into 0 using the following operations any number of times:

        Change the rightmost (0th) bit in the binary representation of n.
        Change the ith bit in the binary representation of n if the (i-1)th bit is set to 1 and the (i-2)th through 0th bits are set to 0.

        Return the minimum number of operations to transform n into 0.
Â 
        Example 1:
        Input: n = 0
        Output: 0

        Example 2:
        Input: n = 3
        Output: 2
        Explanation: The binary representation of 3 is "11".
        "11" -> "01" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
        "01" -> "00" with the 1st operation.

        Example 3:
        Input: n = 6
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is "110".
        "110" -> "010" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.
        "010" -> "011" with the 1st operation.
        "011" -> "001" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.
        "001" -> "000" with the 1st operation.

        Example 4:
        Input: n = 9
        Output: 14

        Example 5:
        Input: n = 333

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We need to transform a given integer `n` into `0` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:
           - Change the rightmost bit (0th bit) in the binary representation of `n`.
           - Change the `i-th` bit if the `(i-1)-th` bit is `1` and all bits from `0` to `(i-2)` are `0`.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           The problem can be approached by understanding the binary representation of `n`. The operations allowed are essentially flipping bits under certain conditions. The key is to determine the minimum number of such flips required to turn all bits to `0`.

           The solution involves:
           - Using a recursive approach to determine the number of operations needed to transform `n` to `0`.
           - If `n` is `0`, no operations are needed.
           - If `n` is `1`, one operation is needed to flip the 0th bit.
           - For larger numbers, recursively determine the number of operations needed for the number formed by removing the most significant bit, and adjust based on whether the most significant bit is `1` or `0`.

        3. **Pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function minimumOneBitOperations(n):
               if n is 0:
                   return 0
               if n is 1:
                   return 1
               find the most significant bit position of n
               let m be the number formed by removing the most significant bit
               if the most significant bit of n is 1:
                   return (1 << position) - 1 - minimumOneBitOperations(m)
               else:
                   return minimumOneBitOperations(m)
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:
                # Helper function to calculate the minimum operations
                def helper(n):
                    if n == 0:
                        return 0
                    if n == 1:
                        return 1
            
                    # Find the most significant bit position
                    msb_pos = n.bit_length() - 1
            
                    # Calculate the number formed by removing the most significant bit
                    m = n ^ (1 << msb_pos)
            
                    # If the most significant bit is 1, use the formula
                    if n & (1 << msb_pos):
                        return (1 << msb_pos) - 1 - helper(m)
                    else:
                        return helper(m)
        
                # Call the helper function with the initial number
                return helper(n)
        ```

        This solution uses a recursive approach to determine the minimum number of operations needed to transform `n` into `0` by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and bit manipulation.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/167 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to a given integer `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n`, we can start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1, and keep doubling it until it is greater than or equal to `n`. This approach works because powers of 2 grow exponentially, so we will quickly reach or exceed `n`.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function next_power_of_2(n):
       if n is 0:
           return 1
       start with power = 1
       while power is less than n:
           double the power
       return power
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

def next_power_of_2(n: int) -> int:
    # If n is 0, the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n is 1
