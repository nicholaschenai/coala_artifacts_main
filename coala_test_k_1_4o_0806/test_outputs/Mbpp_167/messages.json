For example, if `n` is 0, the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 1 (since 2^0 = 1).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1.

The operations allowed are:\n           - Change the rightmost bit (0th bit) in the binary representation of `n`.\n           - Change the `i-th` bit if the `(i-1)-th` bit is `1` and all bits from `0` to `(i-2)` are `0`.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           The problem can be approached by understanding the binary representation of `n`. The operations allowed are essentially flipping bits under certain conditions. The key is to determine the minimum number of such flips required to turn all bits to `0`.\n\n           The solution involves:\n           - Using a recursive approach to determine the number of operations needed to transform `n` to `0`.\n           - If `n` is `0`, no operations are needed.\n           - If `n` is `1`, one operation is needed to flip the 0th bit.\n           - For larger numbers, recursively determine the number of operations needed for the number formed by removing the most significant bit, and adjust based on whether the most significant bit is `1` or `0`.\n\n        3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function minimumOneBitOperations(n):\n               if n is 0:\n                   return 0\n               if n is 1:\n                   return 1\n               find the most significant bit position of n\n               let m be the number formed by removing the most significant bit\n               if the most significant bit of n is 1:\n                   return (1 << position) - 1 - minimumOneBitOperations(m)\n               else:\n                   return minimumOneBitOperations(m)\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n                # Helper function to calculate the minimum operations\n                def helper(n):\n                    if n == 0:\n                        return 0\n                    if n == 1:\n                        return 1\n            \n                    # Find the most significant bit position\n                    msb_pos = n.bit_length() - 1\n            \n                    # Calculate the number formed by removing the most significant bit\n                    m = n ^ (1 << msb_pos)\n            \n                    # If the most significant bit is 1, use the formula\n                    if n & (1 << msb_pos):\n                        return (1 << msb_pos) - 1 - helper(m)\n                    else:\n                        return helper(m)\n        \n                # Call the helper function with the initial number\n                return helper(n)\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses a recursive approach to determine the minimum number of operations needed to transform `n` into `0` by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and bit manipulation.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [0] Output: 0\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
