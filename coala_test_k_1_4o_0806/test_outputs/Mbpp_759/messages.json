        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Past Memory]:\n\n    [Task]:\n        I started this as a joke among friends, telling that converting numbers to other integer bases is for n00bs, while an actual coder at least converts numbers to more complex bases like [pi (or \u03c0 or however you wish to spell it in your language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi), so they dared me proving I was better.\n\n        And I did it in few hours, discovering that what I started as a joke actually has [some math ground and application (particularly the conversion to base pi, it seems)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-integer_representation).\n\n        That said, now I am daring you to do the same, that is to build a function so that it takes a **number** (any number, you are warned!) and optionally the **number of decimals** (default: 0) and a **base** (default: pi), returning the proper conversion **as a string**:\n\n        #Note\n        In Java there is no easy way with optional parameters so all three parameters will be given; the same in C# because, as of now, the used version is not known. \n\n        ```python\n        converter(13) #returns '103'\n        converter(13,3) #returns '103.010'\n        converter(-13,0,2) #returns '-1101'\n        ```\n\n        I know most of the world uses a comma as a [decimal mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark), but as English language and culture are *de facto* the Esperanto of us coders, we will stick to our common glorious traditions and uses, adopting the trivial dot (\".\") as decimal separator; if the absolute value of the result is <1, you have of course to put one (and only one) leading 0 before the decimal separator.\n\n        Finally, you may assume that decimals if provided will always be >= 0 and that no test base will be smaller than 2 (because, you know, converting to base 1 is pretty lame) or greater than 36; as usual, for digits greater than 9 you can use uppercase alphabet letter, so your base of numeration is going to be: '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.\n\n        That is my first 3-languages-kata, so I count on you all to give me extensive feedback, no matter how harsh it may sound, so to improve myself even further :)\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n           The task is to create a function that converts a given number into a string representation in a specified base. The base can be a non-integer, such as \u03c0 (pi), and the function should also handle negative numbers. The function should allow for an optional number of decimal places in the result. The default base is \u03c0, and the default number of decimal places is 0. The function should return the result as a string, using a dot as the decimal separator.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we need to:\n           - Handle both integer and fractional parts of the number separately.\n           - For the integer part, repeatedly divide the number by the base and record the remainders. These remainders represent the digits in the new base.\n           - For the fractional part, multiply the fractional part by the base repeatedly to determine the digits after the decimal point.\n           - Use a character set '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' to represent digits in bases up to 36.\n           - Combine the integer and fractional parts into a single string, ensuring the correct placement of the decimal point.\n           - Handle negative numbers by adding a '-' sign at the beginning of the result.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function converter(n, decimals=0, base=pi):\n               if n is negative:\n                   set is_negative to True\n                   make n positive\n               else:\n                   set is_negative to False\n\n               initialize integer_part as empty string\n               initialize fractional_part as empty string\n\n               while n is greater than or equal to base:\n                   calculate remainder of n divided by base\n                   prepend the character corresponding to remainder to integer_part\n                   update n to be the integer division of n by base\n\n               prepend the character corresponding to n to integer_part\n\n               if decimals is greater than 0:\n                   set fractional_part to '.'\n                   set fractional_value to n - integer part of n\n                   for i from 0 to decimals:\n                       multiply fractional_value by base\n                       set digit to integer part of fractional_value\n                       append the character corresponding to digit to fractional_part\n                       update fractional_value to fractional_value minus digit\n\n               if is_negative:\n                   prepend '-' to integer_part\n\n               return integer_part + fractional_part\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        def converter(n, decimals=0, base=3.141592653589793):\n            # Check if the number is negative\n            is_negative = n < 0\n            if is_negative:\n                n = -n  # Work with the absolute value\n\n            # Characters for digits in bases up to 36\n            digits = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'\n    \n            # Convert the integer part\n            integer_part = ''\n            integer_value = int(n)\n            while integer_value >= base:\n                remainder = integer_value % base\n                integer_part = digits[int(remainder)] + integer_part\n                integer_value = integer_value // base\n            integer_part = digits[int(integer_value)] + integer_part\n\n            # Convert the fractional part\n            fractional_part = ''\n            if decimals > 0:\n                fractional_part = '.'\n                fractional_value = n - int(n)\n                for _ in range(decimals):\n                    fractional_value *= base\n                    digit = int(fractional_value)\n                    fractional_part += digits[digit]\n                    fractional_value -= digit\n\n            # Combine integer and fractional parts\n            result = integer_part + fractional_part\n\n            # Add negative sign if the original number was negative\n            if is_negative:\n                result = '-' + result\n\n            return result\n        ```\n\n        This solution handles the conversion of both integer and fractional parts of a number to a specified base, including non-integer bases like \u03c0, and formats the result as a string.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [13, 0, 8] Output: ['15']\n         Input: [10, 0, 16] Output: ['A']\n         Input: [10000, 4, 13] Output: ['4723.0000']\n         Input: [7, 0, 19] Output: ['7']\n         Input: [13.5, 4, 16] Output: ['D.8000']\n         Input: [10.81, 0, 16] Output: ['A']\n         Input: [1, 2, 2] Output: ['1.00']\n         Input: [-10, 0, 23] Output: ['-A']\n         Input: [0, 4, 26] Output: ['0.0000']\n         Input: [-15.5, 2, 23] Output: ['-F.BB']\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: [13] Expected output: ['103'] # Execution output: 100\n         Input: [10] Expected output: ['100'] # Execution output: 30\n         Input: [13, 3] Expected output: ['103.010'] # Execution output: 100.000\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Failure\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
