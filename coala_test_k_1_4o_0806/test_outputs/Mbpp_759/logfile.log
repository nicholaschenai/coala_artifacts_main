INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/759 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that checks if a given string represents a decimal number with exactly two digits after the decimal point.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, check if the string contains exactly one decimal point.
   - Split the string into two parts using the decimal point as the separator.
   - Ensure that the part before the decimal point is a valid integer (it can be empty, which implies zero).
   - Ensure that the part after the decimal point has exactly two digits.
   - If all these conditions are met, the string is a valid decimal number with a precision of two.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function is_decimal(s):
       if there is not exactly one '.' in s:
           return False
       split s into two parts using '.'
       if the first part is not a valid integer:
           return False
       if the second part does not have exactly two digits:
           return False
       return True
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_decimal(s: str) -> bool:
    # Check if there is exactly one decimal point in the string
    if s.count('.') != 1:
        return False
    
    # Split the string into two parts using the decimal point
    integer_part, decimal_part = s.split('.')
    
    # Check if the integer part is a valid integer (it can be empty, which implies zero)
    if integer_part and not integer_part.isdigit():
        return False
    
    # Check if the decimal part has exactly two digits
    if len(decimal_part) != 2 or not decimal_part.isdigit():
        return False
    
    # If all checks pass, return True
    return True
```

This solution checks for the presence of exactly one decimal point, validates the integer part, and ensures the decimal part has exactly two digits, thus confirming the string is a decimal number with a precision of two.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        I started this as a joke among friends, telling that converting numbers to other integer bases is for n00bs, while an actual coder at least converts numbers to more complex bases like [pi (or Ï€ or however you wish to spell it in your language)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi), so they dared me proving I was better.

        And I did it in few hours, discovering that what I started as a joke actually has [some math ground and application (particularly the conversion to base pi, it seems)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-integer_representation).

        That said, now I am daring you to do the same, that is to build a function so that it takes a **number** (any number, you are warned!) and optionally the **number of decimals** (default: 0) and a **base** (default: pi), returning the proper conversion **as a string**:

        #Note
        In Java there is no easy way with optional parameters so all three parameters will be given; the same in C# because, as of now, the used version is not known. 

        ```python
        converter(13) #returns '103'
        converter(13,3) #returns '103.010'
        converter(-13,0,2) #returns '-1101'
        ```

        I know most of the world uses a comma as a [decimal mark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark), but as English language and culture are *de facto* the Esperanto of us coders, we will stick to our common glorious traditions and uses, adopting the trivial dot (".") as decimal separator; if the absolute value of the result is <1, you have of course to put one (and only one) leading 0 before the decimal separator.

        Finally, you may assume that decimals if provided will always be >= 0 and that no test base will be smaller than 2 (because, you know, converting to base 1 is pretty lame) or greater than 36; as usual, for digits greater than 9 you can use uppercase alphabet letter, so your base of numeration is going to be: '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.

        That is my first 3-languages-kata, so I count on you all to give me extensive feedback, no matter how harsh it may sound, so to improve myself even further :)

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           The task is to create a function that converts a given number into a string representation in a specified base. The base can be a non-integer, such as Ï€ (pi), and the function should also handle negative numbers. The function should allow for an optional number of decimal places in the result. The default base is Ï€, and the default number of decimal places is 0. The function should return the result as a string, using a dot as the decimal separator.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we need to:
           - Handle both integer and fractional parts of the number separately.
           - For the integer part, repeatedly divide the number by the base and record the remainders. These remainders represent the digits in the new base.
           - For the fractional part, multiply the fractional part by the base repeatedly to determine the digits after the decimal point.
           - Use a character set '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' to represent digits in bases up to 36.
           - Combine the integer and fractional parts into a single string, ensuring the correct placement of the decimal point.
           - Handle negative numbers by adding a '-' sign at the beginning of the result.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function converter(n, decimals=0, base=pi):
               if n is negative:
                   set is_negative to True
                   make n positive
               else:
                   set is_negative to False

               initialize integer_part as empty string
               initialize fractional_part as empty string

               while n is greater than or equal to base:
                   calculate remainder of n divided by base
                   prepend the character corresponding to remainder to integer_part
                   update n to be the integer division of n by base

               prepend the character corresponding to n to integer_part

               if decimals is greater than 0:
                   set fractional_part to '.'
                   set fractional_value to n - integer part of n
                   for i from 0 to decimals:
                       multiply fractional_value by base
                       set digit to integer part of fractional_value
                       append the character corresponding to digit to fractional_part
                       update fractional_value to fractional_value minus digit

               if is_negative:
                   prepend '-' to integer_part

               return integer_part + fractional_part
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        def converter(n, decimals=0, base=3.141592653589793):
            # Check if the number is negative
            is_negative = n < 0
            if is_negative:
                n = -n  # Work with the absolute value

            # Characters for digits in bases up to 36
            digits = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    
            # Convert the integer part
            integer_part = ''
            integer_value = int(n)
            while integer_value >= base:
                remainder = integer_value % base
                integer_part = digits[int(remainder)] + integer_part
                integer_value = integer_value // base
            integer_part = digits[int(integer_value)] + integer_part

            # Convert the fractional part
            fractional_part = ''
            if decimals > 0:
                fractional_part = '.'
                fractional_value = n - int(n)
                for _ in range(decimals):
                    fractional_value *= base
                    digit = int(fractional_value)
                    fractional_part += digits[digit]
                    fractional_value -= digit

            # Combine integer and fractional parts
            result = integer_part + fractional_part

            # Add negative sign if the original number was negative
            if is_negative:
                result = '-' + result

            return result
        ```

        This solution handles the conversion of both integer and fractional parts of a number to a specified base, including non-integer bases like Ï€, and formats the result as a string.
