INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/264 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that converts a dog's age in human years to a dog's age in dog years. The function should take an integer representing the dog's age in human years and return an integer representing the dog's age in dog years. We are given that when the dog's age in human years is 12, the dog's age in dog years should be 61.

### Conceptual Solution

To solve this problem, we need to determine the conversion rate from human years to dog years. We can use the given example to find this conversion rate. 

1. We know that 12 human years correspond to 61 dog years.
2. We can calculate the conversion rate by dividing 61 by 12.
3. Once we have the conversion rate, we can multiply any given human age by this rate to get the dog's age in dog years.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `dog_age` that takes an integer `human_years`.
2. Calculate the conversion rate from human years to dog years using the given example: `conversion_rate = 61 / 12`.
3. Calculate the dog's age in dog years by multiplying `human_years` by `conversion_rate`.
4. Return the result as an integer.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def dog_age(human_years: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the conversion rate from human years to dog years
    conversion_rate = 61 / 12
    
    # Calculate the dog's age in dog years
    dog_years = human_years * conversion_rate
    
    # Return the dog's age in dog years as an integer
    return int(dog_years)

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.

    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.

    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. 

    Here is the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
            steps = 0
            while n != 1:
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    n //= 2
                else:
                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        n += 1
                steps += 1
            return steps
    ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/264 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that converts a dog's age in human years to dog years. The function should take an integer representing the dog's age in human years and return the equivalent age in dog years. We are given that when the dog's age is 12 human years, it should be 61 dog years.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to determine the conversion rate from human years to dog years. We know that 12 human years correspond to 61 dog years. We can calculate the conversion factor by dividing 61 by 12. Once we have this conversion factor, we can multiply any given human age by this factor to get the equivalent dog age.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function dog_age that takes an integer human_years as input
       Calculate the conversion factor as 61 divided by 12
       Multiply human_years by the conversion factor to get dog_years
       Return the integer value of dog_years
