    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that converts a dog's age in human years to dog years. The function should take an integer representing the dog's age in human years and return the equivalent age in dog years. We are given that when the dog's age is 12 human years, it should be 61 dog years.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to determine the conversion rate from human years to dog years. We know that 12 human years correspond to 61 dog years. We can calculate the conversion factor by dividing 61 by 12. Once we have this conversion factor, we can multiply any given human age by this factor to get the equivalent dog age.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function dog_age that takes an integer human_years as input\n       Calculate the conversion factor as 61 divided by 12\n       Multiply human_years by the conversion factor to get dog_years\n       Return the integer value of dog_years\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef dog_age(human_years: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the conversion factor from human years to dog years\n    conversion_factor = 61 / 12\n    \n    # Calculate the dog's age in dog years using the conversion factor\n    dog_years = human_years * conversion_factor\n    \n    # Return the integer value of the dog's age in dog years\n    return int(dog_years)\n```",
