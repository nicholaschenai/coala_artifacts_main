This required checking possible placements and ensuring uniqueness.\n\n    2. **Initial Approach**: My approach involved iterating over possible starting positions for \"abacaba\", checking if it could be placed, and then verifying if it was the only occurrence. This was done by replacing '?' with 'z' after placing \"abacaba\".\n\n    3. **Official Solution Insights**:\n       - **Check Function**: The official solution uses a `check` function to count occurrences of \"abacaba\" in the string, which is a clean and reusable way to handle this check.\n       - **Early Exit**: The solution immediately exits if more than one occurrence is found initially, which is efficient.\n       - **Iterative Replacement**: The official solution iteratively tries to place \"abacaba\" and checks if the resulting string has exactly one occurrence, similar to my approach but with a more structured flow.\n       - **Use of Copy**: The official solution uses a copy of the string (`ok = s[::]`) to test modifications, ensuring the original string remains unchanged for further attempts.\n\n    4. **Efficiency and Clarity**: The official solution is efficient in handling edge cases and uses clear logic to ensure the string is modified correctly. It also uses Python's list slicing and copying effectively to manage string modifications.\n\n    5. **Learning Points**:\n       - **Function Reusability**: The use of a separate function to count occurrences is a good practice for clarity and reusability.\n       - **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution efficiently handles cases where \"abacaba\" is already present or cannot be placed uniquely.\n       - **Code Structure**: The structured approach of checking, modifying, and verifying in a loop is a robust way to handle such problems.\n\n    Overall, the official solution provided a structured and efficient way to solve the problem, reinforcing the importance of clear logic and efficient handling of string operations in competitive programming.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
