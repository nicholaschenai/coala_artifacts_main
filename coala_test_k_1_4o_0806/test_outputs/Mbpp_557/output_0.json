    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where each character's case is toggled. This means that every uppercase letter should be converted to lowercase, and every lowercase letter should be converted to uppercase.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate over each character in the input string. For each character, we check if it is uppercase or lowercase. If it is uppercase, we convert it to lowercase, and if it is lowercase, we convert it to uppercase. We can use Python's built-in string methods `upper()` and `lower()` to perform these conversions. Finally, we concatenate all the toggled characters to form the resulting string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function toggle_string(s):\n       initialize an empty string result\n       for each character c in the string s:\n           if c is uppercase:\n               append lowercase of c to result\n           else if c is lowercase:\n               append uppercase of c to result\n           else:\n               append c to result (for non-alphabetic characters)\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef toggle_string(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for c in s:\n        # Check if the character is uppercase\n        if c.isupper():\n            # Convert to lowercase and append to result\n            result += c.lower()\n        # Check if the character is lowercase\n        elif c.islower():\n            # Convert to uppercase and append to result\n            result += c.upper()\n        else:\n            # If it's not an alphabetic character, append it as is\n            result += c\n    \n    # Return the final toggled string\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code will toggle the case of each character in the input string, as required by the problem statement.",
