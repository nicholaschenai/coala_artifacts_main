INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/580 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes a nested tuple containing integers and other nested tuples. The function should return a new tuple with all odd integers removed, preserving the original structure of the nested tuples.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will define a recursive function that processes each element of the tuple.
   - If an element is an integer, we will check if it is even. If it is even, we will include it in the result; otherwise, we will exclude it.
   - If an element is a tuple, we will recursively process it to remove odd integers from it.
   - The function will return a new tuple with only even integers, maintaining the original nested structure.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function `extract_even` that takes a tuple `t` as input.
   Initialize an empty list `result` to store the processed elements.
   For each element `elem` in the tuple `t`:
       If `elem` is an integer:
           If `elem` is even, append it to `result`.
       If `elem` is a tuple:
           Recursively call `extract_even` on `elem` and append the result to `result`.
   Convert `result` back to a tuple and return it.
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def extract_even(t):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the processed elements
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each element in the tuple
    for elem in t:
        # Check if the element is an integer
        if isinstance(elem, int):
            # If the integer is even, add it to the result list
            if elem % 2 == 0:
                result.append(elem)
        # Check if the element is a tuple
        elif isinstance(elem, tuple):
            # Recursively process the nested tuple and add the result to the list
            result.append(extract_even(elem))
    
    # Convert the list back to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)
```

This solution processes each element of the input tuple, checking if it is an integer or a tuple, and applies the necessary logic to filter out odd integers while preserving the nested structure.

Also, here are some of your memories.
Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept revolves around game theory and understanding winning and losing positions based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the integer \( N \). The key insight is that if you can leave your opponent with a disadvantageous position, you can secure a win.

    ### Key Insights:
    1. **Parity Analysis**: 
       - If \( N = 1 \), the player loses immediately because no moves are possible.
       - If \( N \) is even, the player can always make it odd for the opponent, which is disadvantageous for them.
       - If \( N \) is odd, the player can either subtract 1 or divide by an odd divisor, but the goal is to leave the opponent with an even number.

    2. **Winning Strategy**:
       - Always aim to leave the opponent with an odd number if possible, as it limits their options.
       - For even numbers, you can always win by making it odd for the opponent.

    ### Solution Approach:
    - For each test case, check the value of \( N \):
      - If \( N = 1 \), the Grinch wins.
      - If \( N \) is even, you win.
      - If \( N \) is odd, you also win because you can manipulate the number to eventually leave the Grinch with an even number.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def determine_winner(T, test_cases):
        results = []
        for N in test_cases:
            if N == 1:
                results.append("Grinch")
            elif N % 2 == 0:
                results.append("Me")
            else:
                results.append("Me")
        for result in results:
            print(result)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of analyzing the structure of a game to determine winning and losing positions, especially using parity as a strategic tool.
