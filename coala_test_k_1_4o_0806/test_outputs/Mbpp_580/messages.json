        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a nested tuple containing integers and other nested tuples. The function should return a new tuple with all odd integers removed, preserving the original structure of the nested tuples.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will define a recursive function that processes each element of the tuple.\n   - If an element is an integer, we will check if it is even. If it is even, we will include it in the result; otherwise, we will exclude it.\n   - If an element is a tuple, we will recursively process it to remove odd integers from it.\n   - The function will return a new tuple with only even integers, maintaining the original nested structure.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function `extract_even` that takes a tuple `t` as input.\n   Initialize an empty list `result` to store the processed elements.\n   For each element `elem` in the tuple `t`:\n       If `elem` is an integer:\n           If `elem` is even, append it to `result`.\n       If `elem` is a tuple:\n           Recursively call `extract_even` on `elem` and append the result to `result`.\n   Convert `result` back to a tuple and return it.\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_even(t):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the processed elements\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the tuple\n    for elem in t:\n        # Check if the element is an integer\n        if isinstance(elem, int):\n            # If the integer is even, add it to the result list\n            if elem % 2 == 0:\n                result.append(elem)\n        # Check if the element is a tuple\n        elif isinstance(elem, tuple):\n            # Recursively process the nested tuple and add the result to the list\n            result.append(extract_even(elem))\n    \n    # Convert the list back to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThis solution processes each element of the input tuple, checking if it is an integer or a tuple, and applies the necessary logic to filter out odd integers while preserving the nested structure."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the core concept revolves around game theory and understanding winning and losing positions based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the integer \\( N \\). The key insight is that if you can leave your opponent with a disadvantageous position, you can secure a win.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    1. **Parity Analysis**: \n       - If \\( N = 1 \\), the player loses immediately because no moves are possible.\n       - If \\( N \\) is even, the player can always make it odd for the opponent, which is disadvantageous for them.\n       - If \\( N \\) is odd, the player can either subtract 1 or divide by an odd divisor, but the goal is to leave the opponent with an even number.\n\n    2. **Winning Strategy**:\n       - Always aim to leave the opponent with an odd number if possible, as it limits their options.\n       - For even numbers, you can always win by making it odd for the opponent.\n\n    ### Solution Approach:\n    - For each test case, check the value of \\( N \\):\n      - If \\( N = 1 \\), the Grinch wins.\n      - If \\( N \\) is even, you win.\n      - If \\( N \\) is odd, you also win because you can manipulate the number to eventually leave the Grinch with an even number.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def determine_winner(T, test_cases):\n        results = []\n        for N in test_cases:\n            if N == 1:\n                results.append(\"Grinch\")\n            elif N % 2 == 0:\n                results.append(\"Me\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"Me\")\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of analyzing the structure of a game to determine winning and losing positions, especially using parity as a strategic tool.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
