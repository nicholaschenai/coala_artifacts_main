INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/760 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to determine if all the elements in a given list of numbers are the same. If they are, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To check if all elements in a list are the same, we can convert the list into a set. A set automatically removes duplicate elements. If the resulting set has only one element, it means all elements in the list were identical. Therefore, we can return `True`. If the set has more than one element, it means there were different elements in the list, and we should return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Convert the list to a set.
   - Check the length of the set.
   - If the length of the set is 1, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def unique_Element(numbers: list) -> bool:
    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_numbers = set(numbers)
    
    # Check if the length of the set is 1
    return len(unique_numbers) == 1
```

- **Explanation of the code:**
  - We use the `set()` function to convert the list `numbers` into a set `unique_numbers`. This removes any duplicate values.
  - We then check the length of `unique_numbers`. If it is 1, it means all elements in the original list were the same, so we return `True`.
  - If the length is not 1, it means there were different elements in the list, so we return `False`.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine if a list of integers (representing cards) could be rearranged into groups of consecutive numbers, each of a specified size `W`. The key challenge was ensuring that each group consisted of exactly `W` consecutive cards, which required careful counting and ordering of the cards.

    The successful strategy involved using a dictionary to count the occurrences of each card and then sorting the unique cards to process them in ascending order. This allowed for the systematic formation of groups starting from the smallest card. By iterating over the sorted cards and attempting to form groups, we could easily check if a group could be completed or not. If any card needed for a group was unavailable, the function would return `False`.

    The approach was efficient and passed all test cases, confirming its correctness. The use of a dictionary for counting and sorting the unique cards were crucial steps that simplified the problem. This method is a useful pattern for similar problems involving grouping and ordering elements based on specific criteria.
