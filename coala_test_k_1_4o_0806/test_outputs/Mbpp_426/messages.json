A number is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is not zero).\n   - If a number is odd, we will add it to a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return the new list containing only the odd numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `filter_oddnumbers` that takes a list `numbers` as input.\n   - Initialize an empty list `odd_numbers`.\n   - For each `number` in `numbers`:\n     - If `number` is odd (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`):\n       - Append `number` to `odd_numbers`.\n   - Return `odd_numbers`.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef filter_oddnumbers(numbers):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store odd numbers\n    odd_numbers = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is odd\n        if number % 2 != 0:\n            # If it is odd, append it to the odd_numbers list\n            odd_numbers.append(number)\n    \n    # Return the list of odd numbers\n    return odd_numbers\n```\n\nThis function will correctly filter out the odd numbers from the input list and return them as a new list."

The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.\n\n    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.\n\n    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\n    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:\n    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.\n    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.\n    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
