    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes three lists as input and counts how many items are identical and in the same position across all three lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the indices of the lists. For each index, we will check if the elements at that index in all three lists are the same. If they are, we will increase our count by one. Finally, we will return the count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter to 0\n   For each index from 0 to the length of the lists (assuming all lists are of the same length):\n       If the elements at the current index in all three lists are the same:\n           Increment the counter by 1\n   Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_samepair(list1, list2, list3):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of identical items in the same position\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices of the lists\n    for i in range(len(list1)):\n        # Check if the elements at the current index are the same in all three lists\n        if list1[i] == list2[i] == list3[i]:\n            # Increment the counter if they are identical\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of identical items in the same position\n    return count\n```",
