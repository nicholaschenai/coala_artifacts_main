    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts how many characters in a given string are in the same position as they would be in the English alphabet. The comparison should be case insensitive.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Convert the input string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.\n   - Iterate over each character in the string.\n   - For each character, determine its position in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, etc.).\n   - Compare this position with the character's position in the string (considering the first position as 1).\n   - Count how many characters match their position in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function count_char_position(s):\n       convert s to lowercase\n       initialize count to 0\n       for each character in s with index i:\n           calculate the alphabet position of the character\n           if alphabet position equals i + 1:\n               increment count\n       return count\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_char_position(s: str) -> int:\n    # Convert the string to lowercase to handle case insensitivity\n    s = s.lower()\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for characters that match their position\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string with its index\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        # Calculate the position of the character in the alphabet\n        # 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26\n        alphabet_position = ord(char) - ord('a') + 1\n        \n        # Check if the alphabet position matches the character's position in the string\n        # (i + 1 because string positions are 1-based in this context)\n        if alphabet_position == i + 1:\n            # Increment the count if the positions match\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the final count\n    return count\n```",
