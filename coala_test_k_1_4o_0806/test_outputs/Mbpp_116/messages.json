For example, if the input is the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`, the output should be the integer `123`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To solve this problem, we can convert each integer in the tuple to a string, concatenate these strings together, and then convert the resulting string back to an integer. This will give us the desired single integer.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `tuple_to_int` that takes a tuple of integers as input.\n   - Convert each integer in the tuple to a string.\n   - Concatenate all the string representations together.\n   - Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.\n   - Return the resulting integer.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef tuple_to_int(t: tuple) -> int:\n    # Convert each integer in the tuple to a string and join them together\n    concatenated_string = ''.join(str(num) for num in t)\n    # Convert the concatenated string back to an integer\n    result_integer = int(concatenated_string)\n    # Return the resulting integer\n    return result_integer\n```\n\nThis function will take a tuple of positive integers, convert each to a string, concatenate them, and then convert the concatenated string back to an integer, effectively combining the tuple elements into a single integer."

The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.\n\n    #### Key Insights and Strategies\n\n    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.\n\n    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N = test_case[0]\n            A = test_case[1]\n        \n            current_sum = 0\n            possible = True\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                current_sum += A[i]\n                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n        \n            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
