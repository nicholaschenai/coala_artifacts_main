INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/787 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'a' followed immediately by exactly three 'b's. If the string contains this pattern, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and look for the pattern 'abbb'. We will check each character in the string to see if it is 'a', and if it is, we will check the next three characters to see if they are all 'b'. If we find such a pattern, we return `True`. If we reach the end of the string without finding the pattern, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function text_match_three with parameter text
       Loop through each character in text up to the length of text minus 3
           If the current character is 'a' and the next three characters are 'b'
               Return True
       Return False
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def text_match_three(text: str) -> bool:
    # Loop through each character in the string up to the length minus 3
    for i in range(len(text) - 3):
        # Check if the current character is 'a' and the next three are 'b'
        if text[i] == 'a' and text[i+1] == 'b' and text[i+2] == 'b' and text[i+3] == 'b':
            return True
    # If no such pattern is found, return False
    return False
```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights and takeaways:

    1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task was to determine if the string "abacaba" can be placed exactly once in a given string by replacing question marks. This required checking possible placements and ensuring uniqueness.

    2. **Initial Approach**: My approach involved iterating over possible starting positions for "abacaba", checking if it could be placed, and then verifying if it was the only occurrence. This was done by replacing '?' with 'z' after placing "abacaba".

    3. **Official Solution Insights**:
       - **Check Function**: The official solution uses a `check` function to count occurrences of "abacaba" in the string, which is a clean and reusable way to handle this check.
       - **Early Exit**: The solution immediately exits if more than one occurrence is found initially, which is efficient.
       - **Iterative Replacement**: The official solution iteratively tries to place "abacaba" and checks if the resulting string has exactly one occurrence, similar to my approach but with a more structured flow.
       - **Use of Copy**: The official solution uses a copy of the string (`ok = s[::]`) to test modifications, ensuring the original string remains unchanged for further attempts.

    4. **Efficiency and Clarity**: The official solution is efficient in handling edge cases and uses clear logic to ensure the string is modified correctly. It also uses Python's list slicing and copying effectively to manage string modifications.

    5. **Learning Points**:
       - **Function Reusability**: The use of a separate function to count occurrences is a good practice for clarity and reusability.
       - **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution efficiently handles cases where "abacaba" is already present or cannot be placed uniquely.
       - **Code Structure**: The structured approach of checking, modifying, and verifying in a loop is a robust way to handle such problems.

    Overall, the official solution provided a structured and efficient way to solve the problem, reinforcing the importance of clear logic and efficient handling of string operations in competitive programming.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/787 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that checks if a given string contains the letter 'a' followed immediately by three 'b's (i.e., "abbb"). The function should return `True` if this pattern is found in the string and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and check each substring of length 4 to see if it matches "abbb". If we find such a substring, we return `True`. If we finish checking the entire string without finding the pattern, we return `False`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function text_match_three with parameter text
       For each index i from 0 to length of text - 4
           If the substring from i to i+4 is "abbb"
               Return True
