INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/251 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to create a function that takes a list and an element as inputs. The function should insert the given element before each item in the list and return the modified list.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can iterate over the original list and for each element, insert the given element before it. We can achieve this by creating a new list and appending the given element followed by the current element from the original list. Finally, we return the new list.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

1. Initialize an empty list called `result`.
2. Loop through each element in the input list:
   - Append the given element to `result`.
   - Append the current element from the list to `result`.
3. Return the `result` list.

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def insert_element(lst: list, element) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each item in the input list
    for item in lst:
        # Insert the given element before the current item
        result.append(element)
        # Append the current item to the result list
        result.append(item)
    
    # Return the modified list
    return result
```

This function will take a list and an element, and it will insert the element before each item in the list, returning the new list as specified.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this pattern generation task, I encountered a few key insights:

    1. **Pattern Understanding**: The main challenge was correctly understanding the pattern generation logic. The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.

    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.

    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.

    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:
    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.
    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.
    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. 

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.
