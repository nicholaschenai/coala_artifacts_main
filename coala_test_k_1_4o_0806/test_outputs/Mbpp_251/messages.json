Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a list and an element as inputs. The function should insert the given element before each item in the list and return the modified list.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can iterate over the original list and for each element, insert the given element before it. We can achieve this by creating a new list and appending the given element followed by the current element from the original list. Finally, we return the new list.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n1. Initialize an empty list called `result`.\n2. Loop through each element in the input list:\n   - Append the given element to `result`.\n   - Append the current element from the list to `result`.\n3. Return the `result` list.\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef insert_element(lst: list, element) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each item in the input list\n    for item in lst:\n        # Insert the given element before the current item\n        result.append(element)\n        # Append the current item to the result list\n        result.append(item)\n    \n    # Return the modified list\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will take a list and an element, and it will insert the element before each item in the list, returning the new list as specified."

The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.\n\n    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.\n\n    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\n    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:\n    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.\n    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.\n    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
