    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a tuple and an element, and counts how many times the element appears in the tuple.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Input Understanding**: We have a tuple of elements and a single element whose occurrences we need to count in the tuple.\n\n2. **Counting Occurrences**: We can use the built-in `count` method available for tuples in Python, which returns the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.\n\n3. **Output**: The function should return an integer representing the count of the specified element in the tuple.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction count_X(tup, element):\n    return tup.count(element)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef count_X(tup: tuple, element: int) -> int:\n    # Use the built-in count method to count occurrences of element in tup\n    return tup.count(element)\n```",
