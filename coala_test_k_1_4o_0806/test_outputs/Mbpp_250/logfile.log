INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/250 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a Python function that takes two inputs: a tuple and an element. The function should count how many times the given element appears in the tuple and return that count.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will define a function named `count_X` that takes two parameters: a tuple and an element.
2. We will use the built-in method `count()` available for tuples to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple.
3. The function will return the count of the element.

## Pseudocode

```
function count_X(input_tuple, element):
    return input_tuple.count(element)
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count_X(input_tuple: tuple, element: int) -> int:
    # Use the count method of tuple to find the number of occurrences of the element
    return input_tuple.count(element)
```

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Cherry has a string S$S$ consisting of lowercase English letters. Using this string, he formed a pyramid of infinite length with certain rules:
        - N$N$-th row of pyramid contains N$N$ characters.
        - Each row of pyramid begins with the first character of the string.
        - The subsequent characters of the row are appended to the string in cyclic fashion, until the size of string for that Row is reached (See example pyramid for better understanding).
        He has another string T$T$ of smaller (or equal) size.
        You are asked Q$Q$ queries. Each query is provided with a row number N$N$. The answer to the query is number of occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row of pyramid. No of occurrences of String T$T$ in a string V$V$ would mean that you'd need to find number of substrings Vi,Vi+1...Vj$V_i, V_{i+1} ... V_j$ which are equal to String T$T$, where iâ‰¤j$i \leq j$.
        For eg: If the string is code, then the pyramid will be of the form:
        c
        co
        cod
        code
        codec
        codeco
        codecod
        codecode
        codecodec
        codecodeco
        ...

        -----Input:-----
        - The first line contains string S$S$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - The second line contains string T$T$ â€” consisting of lowercase English letters.
        - Next line contains an integer Q$Q$ â€” the number of queries.
        - Then follow Q$Q$ lines with queries descriptions. Each of them contains a single integer N$N$ denoting the row number of pyramid.

        -----Output:-----
        - Print Q$Q$ lines. The i$i$-th of them should contain a integer denoting occurrences of string T$T$ in that particular row.

        -----Constraints-----
        - 1â‰¤|S|â‰¤105$1 \leq |S| \leq 10^5$
        - 1â‰¤|T|â‰¤|S|$1 \leq |T| \leq |S|$
        - 1â‰¤Qâ‰¤105$1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$
        - 1â‰¤Nâ‰¤109$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$

        -----Sample Input:-----
        codechef
        chefcode
        3
        4
        12

        -----Explanation:-----
        Pyramid will be formed as explained in the statement.
        Query 1: Row number 4 of the pyramid is code. The number of occurrences of chefcode in code is 0.
        Query 2: Row number 12 of the pyramid is codechefcode. The number of occurrences of chefcode in codechefcode is 1.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a string \( S \) and a string \( T \). Using \( S \), we form an infinite pyramid where the \( N \)-th row contains \( N \) characters, starting with the first character of \( S \) and continuing in a cyclic manner. We are asked \( Q \) queries, each asking for the number of occurrences of \( T \) in the \( N \)-th row of the pyramid.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Pyramid**: Each row \( N \) of the pyramid is constructed by repeating the string \( S \) cyclically until it reaches length \( N \). For example, if \( S = "codechef" \), the 12th row would be "codechefcode".

        2. **Row Construction**: For a given row \( N \), the row can be constructed by taking the first \( N \) characters of the infinite repetition of \( S \).

        3. **Counting Occurrences**: For each query, we need to count how many times the string \( T \) appears as a substring in the constructed row.

        4. **Efficiency Considerations**: Directly constructing the row for very large \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)) is impractical. Instead, we can use modular arithmetic to determine which characters from \( S \) are in the row.

        5. **Algorithm**:
           - For each query with row number \( N \):
             - Construct the row by taking the first \( N \) characters from the infinite repetition of \( S \).
             - Count the occurrences of \( T \) in this row.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
            results = []
            len_S = length(S)
            len_T = length(T)
    
            for each N in queries:
                row = ""
                for i from 0 to N-1:
                    row += S[i % len_S]
        
                count = 0
                for i from 0 to N - len_T:
                    if row[i:i+len_T] == T:
                        count += 1
        
                results.append(count)
    
            return results
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def count_occurrences(S, T, queries):
            results = []
            len_S = len(S)
            len_T = len(T)
    
            for N in queries:
                # Construct the N-th row
                row = (S * ((N // len_S) + 1))[:N]
        
                # Count occurrences of T in the row
                count = 0
                for i in range(N - len_T + 1):
                    if row[i:i+len_T] == T:
                        count += 1
        
                results.append(count)
    
            return results

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        S = data[0]
        T = data[1]
        Q = int(data[2])
        queries = [int(data[i]) for i in range(3, 3 + Q)]

        # Get results
        results = count_occurrences(S, T, queries)

        # Print results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        This solution efficiently constructs each row by leveraging the cyclic nature of \( S \) and counts the occurrences of \( T \) in each row. The use of slicing and modular arithmetic ensures that the solution is efficient even for large values of \( N \).
