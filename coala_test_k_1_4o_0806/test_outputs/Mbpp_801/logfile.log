INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/801 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes three integers as input and returns the count of how many of these integers are equal to each other. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. If all three integers are the same, return 3.
2. If only two of the integers are the same, return 2.
3. If none of the integers are the same, return 0.

## Pseudocode

1. Check if all three integers are equal:
   - If `a == b == c`, return 3.
2. Check if any two integers are equal:
   - If `a == b` or `b == c` or `a == c`, return 2.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, return 0.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def test_three_equal(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    # Check if all three numbers are equal
    if a == b == c:
        return 3
    # Check if any two numbers are equal
    elif a == b or b == c or a == c:
        return 2
    # If none are equal
    else:
        return 0

Also, here are some of your memories.
Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.

   We need to write a function that takes three integers as input and returns the count of how many of these integers are equal to each other.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to compare the three integers. There are a few possible scenarios:
   - All three integers are the same, in which case the count of equal numbers is 3.
   - Two of the integers are the same, and the third is different, in which case the count of equal numbers is 2.
   - All three integers are different, in which case the count of equal numbers is 0.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function test_three_equal(a, b, c):
       if a == b and b == c:
           return 3
       elif a == b or b == c or a == c:
