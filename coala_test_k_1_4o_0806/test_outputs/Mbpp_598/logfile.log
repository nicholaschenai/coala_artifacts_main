INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/598 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Determine the number of digits**: Convert the number to a string to easily count the number of digits.
2. **Calculate the Armstrong sum**: For each digit in the number, raise it to the power of the total number of digits and sum these values.
3. **Compare the sum to the original number**: If the sum equals the original number, then it is an Armstrong number.

### Pseudocode

1. Convert the number to a string to determine the number of digits, `n`.
2. Initialize a variable `armstrong_sum` to 0.
3. For each digit in the string representation of the number:
   - Convert the digit back to an integer.
   - Raise it to the power of `n`.
   - Add the result to `armstrong_sum`.
4. Compare `armstrong_sum` with the original number.
5. Return `True` if they are equal, otherwise return `False`.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def armstrong_number(number: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the number to a string to easily iterate over digits
    num_str = str(number)
    # Determine the number of digits
    num_digits = len(num_str)
    # Initialize the sum of powers
    armstrong_sum = 0
    
    # Calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits
    for digit in num_str:
        armstrong_sum += int(digit) ** num_digits
    
    # Check if the calculated sum is equal to the original number
    return armstrong_sum == number
```

This function will correctly determine if a given number is an Armstrong number by following the steps outlined above.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We need to determine the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). We are given multiple test cases, each with different values of \( N \) and \( K \).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find all combinations of unique positive integers such that their \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

        2. **Recursive Backtracking**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers. Starting from 1, we try to include each integer's \( K \)-th power in the sum and recursively check if we can reach the target sum \( N \).

        3. **Base Cases**:
           - If the sum of powers equals \( N \), we have found a valid combination.
           - If the sum exceeds \( N \), we stop exploring that path.

        4. **Recursive Case**: For each integer starting from 1, we decide whether to include its \( K \)-th power in the current sum and recursively attempt to complete the sum with the next integers.

        5. **Avoid Duplicates**: Ensure that each combination of integers is unique by always considering integers in increasing order.

        ## Pseudocode

        1. Define a recursive function `countWays(current_sum, start)`:
           - If `current_sum` equals \( N \), increment the count of valid combinations.
           - If `current_sum` exceeds \( N \), return.
           - For each integer `i` starting from `start`:
             - Calculate `i^K`.
             - Recursively call `countWays(current_sum + i^K, i + 1)`.

        2. For each test case, initialize the count to 0 and call `countWays(0, 1)`.

        3. Output the count for each test case.

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def countWays(N, K, current_sum, start):
            if current_sum == N:
                return 1
            if current_sum > N:
                return 0
    
            count = 0
            i = start
            while True:
                power = i ** K
                if current_sum + power > N:
                    break
                count += countWays(N, K, current_sum + power, i + 1)
                i += 1
            return count

        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
    
            results = []
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                result = countWays(N, K, 0, 1)
                results.append(result)
    
            for res in results:
                print(res)

        ```

        This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed accordingly.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding Armstrong Numbers**: For a number to be an Armstrong number, each digit of the number is raised to the power of the total number of digits, and the sum of these powered digits should equal the original number.

2. **Steps to Determine if a Number is Armstrong**:
   - Convert the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
   - Count the number of digits in the number.
   - For each digit, raise it to the power of the total number of digits.
   - Sum all these powered digits.
   - Compare the sum to the original number. If they are equal, the number is an Armstrong number.

## Pseudocode

1. Convert the number to a string to get the digits.
2. Calculate the number of digits.
3. Initialize a sum to zero.
4. For each digit in the number:
   - Convert the digit back to an integer.
   - Raise it to the power of the number of digits.
   - Add the result to the sum.
5. Compare the sum to the original number.
6. Return `True` if they are equal, otherwise return `False`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def armstrong_number(n: int) -> bool:
    # Convert the number to a string to iterate over digits
    digits = str(n)
    # Calculate the number of digits
    num_digits = len(digits)

        sum_of_powers += int(digit) ** num_digits
    # Check if the sum of powered digits equals the original number
    return sum_of_powers == n
