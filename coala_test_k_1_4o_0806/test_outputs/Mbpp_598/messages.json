An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Determine the number of digits**: Convert the number to a string to easily count the number of digits.\n2. **Calculate the Armstrong sum**: For each digit in the number, raise it to the power of the total number of digits and sum these values.\n3. **Compare the sum to the original number**: If the sum equals the original number, then it is an Armstrong number.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Convert the number to a string to determine the number of digits, `n`.\n2. Initialize a variable `armstrong_sum` to 0.\n3. For each digit in the string representation of the number:\n   - Convert the digit back to an integer.\n   - Raise it to the power of `n`.\n   - Add the result to `armstrong_sum`.\n4. Compare `armstrong_sum` with the original number.\n5. Return `True` if they are equal, otherwise return `False`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef armstrong_number(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Convert the number to a string to easily iterate over digits\n    num_str = str(number)\n    # Determine the number of digits\n    num_digits = len(num_str)\n    # Initialize the sum of powers\n    armstrong_sum = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits\n    for digit in num_str:\n        armstrong_sum += int(digit) ** num_digits\n    \n    # Check if the calculated sum is equal to the original number\n    return armstrong_sum == number\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if a given number is an Armstrong number by following the steps outlined above."

We are given multiple test cases, each with different values of \\( N \\) and \\( K \\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find all combinations of unique positive integers such that their \\( K \\)-th powers sum up to \\( N \\).\n\n        2. **Recursive Backtracking**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers. Starting from 1, we try to include each integer's \\( K \\)-th power in the sum and recursively check if we can reach the target sum \\( N \\).\n\n        3. **Base Cases**:\n           - If the sum of powers equals \\( N \\), we have found a valid combination.\n           - If the sum exceeds \\( N \\), we stop exploring that path.\n\n        4. **Recursive Case**: For each integer starting from 1, we decide whether to include its \\( K \\)-th power in the current sum and recursively attempt to complete the sum with the next integers.\n\n        5. **Avoid Duplicates**: Ensure that each combination of integers is unique by always considering integers in increasing order.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        1. Define a recursive function `countWays(current_sum, start)`:\n           - If `current_sum` equals \\( N \\), increment the count of valid combinations.\n           - If `current_sum` exceeds \\( N \\), return.\n           - For each integer `i` starting from `start`:\n             - Calculate `i^K`.\n             - Recursively call `countWays(current_sum + i^K, i + 1)`.\n\n        2. For each test case, initialize the count to 0 and call `countWays(0, 1)`.\n\n        3. Output the count for each test case.\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def countWays(N, K, current_sum, start):\n            if current_sum == N:\n                return 1\n            if current_sum > N:\n                return 0\n    \n            count = 0\n            i = start\n            while True:\n                power = i ** K\n                if current_sum + power > N:\n                    break\n                count += countWays(N, K, current_sum + power, i + 1)\n                i += 1\n            return count\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n    \n            results = []\n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                result = countWays(N, K, 0, 1)\n                results.append(result)\n    \n            for res in results:\n                print(res)\n\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \\( K \\)-th powers sum up to \\( N \\). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed accordingly.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['2', '4 1', '38 2'] Expected output: [{'2'}, {'1'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.
