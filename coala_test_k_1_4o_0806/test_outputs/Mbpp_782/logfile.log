INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/782 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all subarrays that have an odd length. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to:
   - Iterate over all possible subarrays of the input list.
   - Check if the length of each subarray is odd.
   - If it is odd, calculate the sum of the elements in that subarray and add it to a running total.
   - Finally, return the total sum of all odd-length subarrays.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize total_sum to 0
   For each starting index i from 0 to the length of the array - 1:
       For each ending index j from i to the length of the array - 1:
           If the length of the subarray from i to j is odd:
               Calculate the sum of the subarray
               Add the sum to total_sum
   Return total_sum
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def odd_length_sum(arr):
    # Initialize the total sum of odd-length subarrays
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over all possible starting indices of subarrays
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Iterate over all possible ending indices of subarrays
        for j in range(i, len(arr)):
            # Check if the length of the subarray is odd
            if (j - i + 1) % 2 == 1:
                # Calculate the sum of the current subarray
                subarray_sum = sum(arr[i:j+1])
                # Add the subarray sum to the total sum
                total_sum += subarray_sum
    
    # Return the total sum of all odd-length subarrays
    return total_sum
```

This code iterates over all possible subarrays, checks if their length is odd, and sums up their elements if they are. The final result is the sum of all such subarrays.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to compute the sums of all non-empty continuous subarrays of a given array, sort these sums, and then calculate the sum of a specified range of these sorted sums. The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.
    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.
    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.
    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
            subarray_sums = []
            for start in range(n):
                current_sum = 0
                for end in range(start, n):
                    current_sum += nums[end]
                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
            subarray_sums.sort()
            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])
            return result % (10**9 + 7)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/782 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the sum of all subarrays of a given list that have an odd length. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 4]`, the subarrays with odd lengths are `[1]`, `[2]`, `[4]`, and `[1, 2, 4]`. We need to calculate the sum of all these subarrays.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate over all possible subarrays of the given list. For each subarray, we check if its length is odd. If it is, we calculate the sum of the elements in that subarray and add it to a running total. Finally, we return this total sum.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize total_sum to 0
   For each starting index i from 0 to length of array - 1:
       Initialize current_sum to 0
       For each ending index j from i to length of array - 1:
           Add array[j] to current_sum
           If the length of the subarray (j - i + 1) is odd:
               Add current_sum to total_sum
