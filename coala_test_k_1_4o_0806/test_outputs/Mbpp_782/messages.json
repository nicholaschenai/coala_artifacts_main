A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Iterate over all possible subarrays of the input list.\n   - Check if the length of each subarray is odd.\n   - If it is odd, calculate the sum of the elements in that subarray and add it to a running total.\n   - Finally, return the total sum of all odd-length subarrays.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize total_sum to 0\n   For each starting index i from 0 to the length of the array - 1:\n       For each ending index j from i to the length of the array - 1:\n           If the length of the subarray from i to j is odd:\n               Calculate the sum of the subarray\n               Add the sum to total_sum\n   Return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_length_sum(arr):\n    # Initialize the total sum of odd-length subarrays\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible starting indices of subarrays\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Iterate over all possible ending indices of subarrays\n        for j in range(i, len(arr)):\n            # Check if the length of the subarray is odd\n            if (j - i + 1) % 2 == 1:\n                # Calculate the sum of the current subarray\n                subarray_sum = sum(arr[i:j+1])\n                # Add the subarray sum to the total sum\n                total_sum += subarray_sum\n    \n    # Return the total sum of all odd-length subarrays\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis code iterates over all possible subarrays, checks if their length is odd, and sums up their elements if they are.

The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:\n    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.\n    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.\n    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.\n    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n            subarray_sums = []\n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n            subarray_sums.sort()\n            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])\n            return result % (10**9 + 7)\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

        "content": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the sum of all subarrays of a given list that have an odd length. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 4]`, the subarrays with odd lengths are `[1]`, `[2]`, `[4]`, and `[1, 2, 4]`. We need to calculate the sum of all these subarrays.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate over all possible subarrays of the given list. For each subarray, we check if its length is odd. If it is, we calculate the sum of the elements in that subarray and add it to a running total. Finally, we return this total sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize total_sum to 0\n   For each starting index i from 0 to length of array - 1:\n       Initialize current_sum to 0\n       For each ending index j from i to length of array - 1:\n           Add array[j] to current_sum\n           If the length of the subarray (j - i + 1) is odd:\n               Add current_sum to total_sum\n   Return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_length_sum(arr):\n    # Initialize the total sum of all odd-length subarrays\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each possible starting index of the subarray\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Initialize the current sum for the subarray starting at index i\n        current_sum = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each possible ending index of the subarray\n        for j in range(i, len(arr)):\n            # Add the current element to the current sum\n            current_sum += arr[j]\n            \n            # Check if the length of the subarray is odd\n            if (j - i + 1) % 2 == 1:\n                # If odd, add the current sum to the total sum\n                total_sum += current_sum\n    \n    # Return the total sum of all odd-length subarrays\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis code iterates over all possible subarrays, checks if their length is odd, and accumulates their sums into `total_sum`. The final result is the sum of all odd-length subarrays."
