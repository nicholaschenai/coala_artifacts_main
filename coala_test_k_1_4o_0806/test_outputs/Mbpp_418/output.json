    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the list that has the maximum length among them.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each list in the input list of lists. We will keep track of the list with the maximum length encountered so far. If we find a list with a length greater than the current maximum, we update our record of the maximum length list. Finally, we return the list with the maximum length.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function Find_Max that takes a list of lists as input\n       Initialize a variable max_list to the first list in the input\n       For each list in the input list of lists\n           If the current list's length is greater than the length of max_list\n               Update max_list to be the current list\n       Return max_list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Find_Max(lists):\n    # Initialize max_list to the first list in the input\n    max_list = lists[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through each list in the input list of lists\n    for lst in lists:\n        # If the current list's length is greater than the length of max_list\n        if len(lst) > len(max_list):\n            # Update max_list to be the current list\n            max_list = lst\n    \n    # Return the list with the maximum length\n    return max_list\n```",
