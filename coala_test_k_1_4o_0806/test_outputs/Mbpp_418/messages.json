If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function should return the first one it encounters.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the sublist with the maximum length found so far.\n2. Iterate through each sublist in the input list.\n3. For each sublist, check its length.\n4. If the current sublist's length is greater than the length of the sublist stored in the variable, update the variable to the current sublist.\n5. After iterating through all sublists, return the sublist stored in the variable.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n    max_list = list_of_lists[0]  # Start with the first sublist as the maximum\n    for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n        if length of sublist > length of max_list:\n            max_list = sublist\n    return max_list\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef Find_Max(list_of_lists):\n    # Start with the first sublist as the maximum\n    max_list = list_of_lists[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # If the current sublist's length is greater than the max_list's length, update max_list\n        if len(sublist) > len(max_list):\n            max_list = sublist\n    \n    # Return the sublist with the maximum length\n    return max_list\n```"

The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.\n\n    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.\n\n    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            n = len(nums)\n            d = [1] * n\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
