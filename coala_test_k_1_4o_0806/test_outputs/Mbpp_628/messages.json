The function should return the modified string.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.\n   - If the character is a space, we will append '%20' to a new string.\n   - If the character is not a space, we will append the character itself to the new string.\n   - Finally, we will return the new string which will have all spaces replaced by '%20'.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function replace_spaces(input_string):\n       initialize an empty string called result\n       for each character in input_string:\n           if the character is a space:\n               append '%20' to result\n           else:\n               append the character to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef replace_spaces(input_string: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to build the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # If the character is a space, append '%20' to the result\n        if char == ' ':\n            result += '%20'\n        # Otherwise, append the character itself to the result\n        else:\n            result += char\n    \n    # Return the final result string with spaces replaced by '%20'\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the input string once, appending either '%20' or the character itself to the result string, ensuring that all spaces are replaced as required."

The problem tested the ability to manipulate strings and handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n\n    Initially, the solution logic was encapsulated in a function, but it wasn't called, leading to no output. This highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed, especially in competitive programming settings where input/output is handled through standard IO.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved:\n    1. Iterating over each possible starting position in the string to check if \"abacaba\" could be placed by replacing question marks.\n    2. Replacing remaining question marks with a filler character ('z') to complete the string.\n    3. Verifying that \"abacaba\" appears exactly once in the modified string.\n\n    The unexpected error of no output was fixed by explicitly calling the `solve()` function, ensuring the logic was executed. This experience reinforced the importance of verifying function calls and understanding input/output handling in script-based environments. The final solution efficiently handled multiple test cases and correctly determined the possibility of placing \"abacaba\" exactly once.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Whenever we encounter a space character, we replace it with '%20'. We can achieve this by using Python's string method `replace`, which allows us to replace all occurrences of a substring with another substring in one go.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named replace_spaces that takes a single parameter, a string.\n   Use the string method replace to replace all spaces (' ') with '%20'.\n   Return the modified string.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef replace_spaces(s: str) -> str:\n    # Use the replace method to replace all spaces with '%20'\n    return s.replace(' ', '%20')\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `replace` method, which is efficient and directly solves the problem by replacing all spaces in the string with '%20'."
