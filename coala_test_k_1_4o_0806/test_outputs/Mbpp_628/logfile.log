INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/628 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every space character in the string with the sequence '%20'. The function should return the modified string.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate through each character in the input string.
   - If the character is a space, we will append '%20' to a new string.
   - If the character is not a space, we will append the character itself to the new string.
   - Finally, we will return the new string which will have all spaces replaced by '%20'.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function replace_spaces(input_string):
       initialize an empty string called result
       for each character in input_string:
           if the character is a space:
               append '%20' to result
           else:
               append the character to result
       return result
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def replace_spaces(input_string: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to build the result
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # If the character is a space, append '%20' to the result
        if char == ' ':
            result += '%20'
        # Otherwise, append the character itself to the result
        else:
            result += char
    
    # Return the final result string with spaces replaced by '%20'
    return result
```

This solution iterates through the input string once, appending either '%20' or the character itself to the result string, ensuring that all spaces are replaced as required.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of determining if the string "abacaba" can be placed exactly once in a given string with question marks, the core concept was to identify potential positions for "abacaba" and ensure it appears exactly once after replacing question marks. The problem tested the ability to manipulate strings and handle multiple test cases efficiently.

    Initially, the solution logic was encapsulated in a function, but it wasn't called, leading to no output. This highlighted the importance of ensuring that functions are executed, especially in competitive programming settings where input/output is handled through standard IO.

    The strategy that worked involved:
    1. Iterating over each possible starting position in the string to check if "abacaba" could be placed by replacing question marks.
    2. Replacing remaining question marks with a filler character ('z') to complete the string.
    3. Verifying that "abacaba" appears exactly once in the modified string.

    The unexpected error of no output was fixed by explicitly calling the `solve()` function, ensuring the logic was executed. This experience reinforced the importance of verifying function calls and understanding input/output handling in script-based environments. The final solution efficiently handled multiple test cases and correctly determined the possibility of placing "abacaba" exactly once.

   We need to create a function that takes a string as input and replaces every space character in the string with the sequence '%20'. The function should return the modified string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate over each character in the input string. Whenever we encounter a space character, we replace it with '%20'. We can achieve this by using Python's string method `replace`, which allows us to replace all occurrences of a substring with another substring in one go.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function named replace_spaces that takes a single parameter, a string.
   Use the string method replace to replace all spaces (' ') with '%20'.
   Return the modified string.
   ```

```python
