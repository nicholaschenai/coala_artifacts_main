INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/123 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to a given number `n`. An amicable number is part of a pair of numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other. For example, 220 and 284 are an amicable pair because the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284, and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Proper Divisors**: For a given number, find all its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself).
2. **Sum of Divisors**: Calculate the sum of these proper divisors.
3. **Check Amicable Pair**: For each number up to `n`, check if it forms an amicable pair with another number.
4. **Sum Amicable Numbers**: If a number is part of an amicable pair, add it to the sum. Ensure each number is only counted once.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `sum_of_divisors(num)` that returns the sum of proper divisors of `num`.
2. Define the main function `amicable_numbers_sum(n)`:
   - Initialize a variable `amicable_sum` to 0.
   - Create a set `checked` to keep track of numbers already checked.
   - Loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n`:
     - If `i` is in `checked`, continue to the next iteration.
     - Calculate `sum_i` as the sum of divisors of `i`.
     - If `sum_i` is not equal to `i` and the sum of divisors of `sum_i` is `i`, then `i` and `sum_i` are an amicable pair.
     - Add both `i` and `sum_i` to `amicable_sum`.
     - Add both `i` and `sum_i` to `checked`.
   - Return `amicable_sum`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def sum_of_divisors(num: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the sum of proper divisors of num
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            total += i
    return total

def amicable_numbers_sum(n: int) -> int:
    amicable_sum = 0
    checked = set()
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i in checked:
            continue
        
        sum_i = sum_of_divisors(i)
        
        if sum_i != i and sum_i <= n:
            sum_j = sum_of_divisors(sum_i)
            if sum_j == i:
                amicable_sum += i
                if sum_i <= n:
                    amicable_sum += sum_i
                checked.add(i)
                checked.add(sum_i)
    
    return amicable_sum
```

This code defines a helper function to calculate the sum of proper divisors and uses it to find and sum all amicable numbers up to `n`. The `checked` set ensures that each number is only considered once, preventing double-counting.

Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.
