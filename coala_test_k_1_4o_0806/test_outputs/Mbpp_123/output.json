    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of all amicable numbers from 1 up to a given number. An amicable number is part of a pair of numbers where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the other.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Define a function to find the sum of proper divisors of a number.\n   - Iterate through each number from 1 to the specified number.\n   - For each number, find its sum of proper divisors and check if it forms an amicable pair with another number.\n   - If a number is part of an amicable pair and is less than the specified number, add it to the sum.\n   - Return the total sum of all such amicable numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function sum_of_divisors(n):\n       Initialize sum to 0\n       For each number i from 1 to n-1:\n           If i is a divisor of n:\n               Add i to sum\n       Return sum\n\n   Define function amicable_numbers_sum(limit):\n       Initialize total_sum to 0\n       For each number a from 1 to limit:\n           Find b as sum_of_divisors(a)\n           If b is not equal to a and sum_of_divisors(b) equals a:\n               Add a to total_sum\n       Return total_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number\ndef sum_of_divisors(n):\n    # Initialize sum to 0\n    sum_div = 0\n    # Iterate over all numbers from 1 to n-1\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        # If i is a divisor of n, add it to the sum\n        if n % i == 0:\n            sum_div += i\n    return sum_div\n\n# Function to calculate the sum of all amicable numbers up to a given limit\ndef amicable_numbers_sum(limit):\n    # Initialize total sum of amicable numbers to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    # Iterate over each number from 1 to the limit\n    for a in range(1, limit):\n        # Find the sum of divisors of a\n        b = sum_of_divisors(a)\n        # Check if a and b form an amicable pair\n        if b != a and sum_of_divisors(b) == a:\n            # Add a to the total sum if it is part of an amicable pair\n            total_sum += a\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis code defines two functions: `sum_of_divisors` to calculate the sum of proper divisors of a number, and `amicable_numbers_sum` to find and sum all amicable numbers up to a specified limit.",
