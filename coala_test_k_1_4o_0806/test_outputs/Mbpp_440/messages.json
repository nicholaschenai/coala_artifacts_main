An adverb is typically a word that ends with \"ly\". The function should return a tuple containing the starting index, ending index, and the adverb.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Split the sentence into words. This can be done by splitting the sentence on spaces.\n2. Iterate over each word and check if it ends with \"ly\".\n3. If a word ends with \"ly\", determine its starting and ending positions in the original sentence.\n4. Return a tuple with the starting index, ending index, and the adverb.\n5. If no adverb is found, the function should return `None`.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `find_adverb_position` that takes a string `sentence`.\n2. Split the `sentence` into words using the `split()` method.\n3. Initialize a variable `current_index` to 0 to keep track of the position in the original sentence.\n4. For each `word` in the list of words:\n   - Check if the `word` ends with \"ly\".\n   - If it does:\n     - Calculate the starting index as `current_index`.\n     - Calculate the ending index as `current_index + len(word)`.\n     - Return a tuple `(starting_index, ending_index, word)`.\n   - Update `current_index` by adding the length of the `word` plus one (for the space).\n5. If no adverb is found, return `None`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str):\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    # Initialize the current index to track the position in the original sentence\n    current_index = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each word\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word ends with \"ly\"\n        if word.endswith(\"ly\"):\n            # Calculate the starting and ending indices\n            starting_index = current_index\n            ending_index = current_index + len(word)\n            # Return the tuple with starting index, ending index, and the adverb\n            return (starting_index, ending_index, word)\n        \n        # Update the current index for the next word\n        current_index += len(word) + 1  # +1 for the space\n    \n    # If no adverb is found, return None\n    return None\n```\n"

An adverb is typically a word that ends with \"ly\". The function should return a tuple containing the starting index, ending index, and the adverb.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Adverbs**: Adverbs in English often end with \"ly\". We will use this rule to identify adverbs in the sentence.\n2. **Split the Sentence**: Break the sentence into words. This can be done using the `split()` method which will handle spaces and punctuation.\n3. **Find the First Adverb**: Iterate over the words and check if any word ends with \"ly\". If found, record its position.\n4. **Calculate Positions**: Calculate the starting and ending positions of the adverb in the original sentence.\n5. **Return the Result**: Return a tuple with the starting index, ending index, and the adverb.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1.

        "content": "## Analysis of the Problem\n\nThe code is failing because it does not correctly handle punctuation attached to words. The `split()` method splits the sentence by spaces, but it does not remove punctuation from the words. Therefore, when checking if a word ends with \"ly\", it fails if there is punctuation attached to the word, such as \"clearly!!\".\n\n## Where the Solution Went Wrong\n\n1. **Handling Punctuation**: The solution does not account for punctuation that may be attached to words. This causes the check for words ending with \"ly\" to fail when punctuation is present.\n2. **Word Boundary Detection**: The solution assumes that words are separated by spaces only, which is not always the case when punctuation is involved.\n\n## Revised Plan\n\n1. **Split the Sentence**: Use a method to split the sentence into words while considering punctuation.\n2. **Strip Punctuation**: For each word, strip punctuation from the end before checking if it ends with \"ly\".\n3. **Track Original Positions**: Keep track of the original positions of words in the sentence to calculate the correct indices.\n4. **Return the Result**: Return the starting and ending indices along with the adverb.\n\n## Revised Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `find_adverb_position(sentence)`.\n2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current index in the sentence.\n3. Split the sentence into words using a loop that manually handles spaces and punctuation.\n4. For each word:\n   - Strip punctuation from the end of the word.\n   - Check if the stripped word ends with \"ly\".\n   - If it does, calculate the starting and ending positions of the original word in the sentence.\n   - Return a tuple with the starting index, ending index, and the original word.\n5. If no adverb is found, return `None`.\n\n## Revised Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Initialize the current index to track position in the sentence\n    current_index = 0\n    length = len(sentence)\n    \n    # Iterate over the sentence manually to handle punctuation\n    while current_index < length:\n        # Find the start of the next word\n        while current_index < length and not sentence[current_index].isalpha():\n            current_index += 1\n        \n        # If we reach the end of the sentence, break\n        if current_index >= length:\n            break\n        \n        # Find the end of the current word\n        start_index = current_index\n        while current_index < length and (sentence[current_index].isalpha() or sentence[current_index] in \"-'\"):\n            current_index += 1\n        \n        # Extract the word and strip punctuation from the end\n        word = sentence[start_index:current_index].rstrip('!.,?')\n        \n        # Check if the word ends with 'ly'\n        if word.endswith('ly'):\n            # Return the tuple with start index, end index, and the adverb\n            return (start_index, current_index, word)\n        \n        # Move past any trailing punctuation or spaces\n        while current_index < length and not sentence[current_index].isalpha():\n            current_index += 1\n    \n    # If no adverb is found, return None\n    return None\n```\n\nThis revised solution should correctly handle punctuation and find the first adverb in the sentence."
