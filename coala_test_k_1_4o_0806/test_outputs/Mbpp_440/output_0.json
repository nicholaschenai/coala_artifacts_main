    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that identifies the first adverb in a given sentence and returns its starting and ending positions along with the adverb itself. An adverb is typically a word that ends with \"ly\". The function should return a tuple containing the starting index, ending index, and the adverb.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify Adverbs**: Adverbs in English often end with \"ly\". We will use this rule to identify adverbs in the sentence.\n2. **Split the Sentence**: Break the sentence into words. This can be done using the `split()` method which will handle spaces and punctuation.\n3. **Find the First Adverb**: Iterate over the words and check if any word ends with \"ly\". If found, record its position.\n4. **Calculate Positions**: Calculate the starting and ending positions of the adverb in the original sentence.\n5. **Return the Result**: Return a tuple with the starting index, ending index, and the adverb.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `find_adverb_position(sentence)`.\n2. Split the sentence into words.\n3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current index in the sentence.\n4. Iterate over each word:\n   - If the word ends with \"ly\":\n     - Calculate the starting and ending positions of the word in the sentence.\n     - Return a tuple with the starting index, ending index, and the word.\n   - Update the current index to account for the word and any following space or punctuation.\n5. If no adverb is found, return `None`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_adverb_position(sentence: str) -> tuple:\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Initialize the current index to track position in the sentence\n    current_index = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each word in the sentence\n    for word in words:\n        # Check if the word ends with 'ly'\n        if word.endswith('ly'):\n            # Calculate the starting and ending positions of the adverb\n            start_index = current_index\n            end_index = start_index + len(word)\n            # Return the tuple with start index, end index, and the adverb\n            return (start_index, end_index, word)\n        \n        # Update the current index to the next word's starting position\n        # Add 1 to account for the space or punctuation after the word\n        current_index += len(word) + 1\n    \n    # If no adverb is found, return None\n    return None\n```\n\nThis solution will correctly identify the first adverb in a sentence and return its position and the adverb itself.",
