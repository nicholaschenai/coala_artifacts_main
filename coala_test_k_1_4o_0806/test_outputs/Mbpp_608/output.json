    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth Bell number. The Bell numbers are a sequence of numbers that represent the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. For example, the 0th Bell number is 1, the 1st Bell number is 1, the 2nd Bell number is 2, and so on.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth Bell number, we can use a triangular array known as Bell's triangle. The first element of the first row is 1. Each subsequent row starts with the last element of the previous row. Each element in the row is the sum of the element to the left and the element above it. The nth Bell number is the first element of the nth row.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function bell_Number(n):\n       Create a 2D list (triangle) with n+1 rows\n       Initialize the first element of the first row to 1\n       For each row i from 1 to n:\n           Set the first element of the row to the last element of the previous row\n           For each element j from 1 to i:\n               Set the current element to the sum of the element to the left and the element above\n       Return the first element of the nth row\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef bell_Number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Create a 2D list (triangle) with n+1 rows\n    bell_triangle = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Initialize the first element of the first row to 1\n    bell_triangle[0][0] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the Bell triangle\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Set the first element of the row to the last element of the previous row\n        bell_triangle[i][0] = bell_triangle[i - 1][i - 1]\n        \n        # Fill the rest of the row\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            # Set the current element to the sum of the element to the left and the element above\n            bell_triangle[i][j] = bell_triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + bell_triangle[i][j - 1]\n    \n    # Return the first element of the nth row\n    return bell_triangle[n][0]\n```",
