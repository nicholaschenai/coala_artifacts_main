INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/388 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given integer `n`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1 (i.e., 2^0).
   - Continuously multiply by 2 to get the next power of 2.
   - Stop when the next power of 2 would be greater than `n`.
   - The last power of 2 that was less than or equal to `n` is the answer.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   Initialize power as 1
   While power * 2 is less than or equal to n:
       Multiply power by 2
   Return power
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def highest_Power_of_2(n: int) -> int:
    # Start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1 (2^0)
    power = 1
    
    # Keep multiplying by 2 until the next power would exceed n
    while power * 2 <= n:
        power *= 2
    
    # Return the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n
    return power
```

This function initializes `power` to 1 and keeps doubling it until doubling again would exceed `n`. The last valid `power` is returned as the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.

    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.

    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. 

    Here is the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
            steps = 0
            while n != 1:
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    n //= 2
                else:
                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        n += 1
                steps += 1
            return steps
    ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/388 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to a given integer `n`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`, we can start with the smallest power of 2, which is 1, and keep doubling it until it exceeds `n`. The last power of 2 that was less than or equal to `n` is our answer.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize a variable `power` to 1 (which is 2^0).
   While `power` is less than or equal to `n`:
       Double the value of `power`.
   Divide `power` by 2 to get the last valid power of 2.
   Return `power`.
