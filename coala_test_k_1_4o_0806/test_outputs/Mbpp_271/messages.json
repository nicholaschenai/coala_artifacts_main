Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and calculates the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, each raised to the fifth power.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n- Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. Even natural numbers start from 2 and increase by 2 (i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...).\n- For each of these even numbers, raise it to the power of 5.\n- Sum all these fifth powers to get the final result.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction even_Power_Sum(n):\n    initialize sum to 0\n    for i from 1 to n:\n        calculate the ith even number as 2 * i\n        raise this even number to the power of 5\n        add the result to sum\n    return sum\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef even_Power_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n even numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the ith even number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Raise the even number to the power of 5\n        power_five = even_number ** 5\n        # Add the result to the total sum\n        total_sum += power_five\n    \n    # Return the total sum\n    return total_sum\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, each raised to the fifth power, as required by the problem statement."

The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.\n    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.\n    - This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).\n\n    ### Implementation:\n    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.\n    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
