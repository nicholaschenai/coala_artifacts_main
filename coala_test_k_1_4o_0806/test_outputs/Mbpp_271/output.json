    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, each raised to the fifth power.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, identify the first `n` even natural numbers. These numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to `2n`.\n   - For each of these even numbers, raise it to the fifth power.\n   - Sum all these fifth powers to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function even_Power_Sum(n):\n       initialize sum to 0\n       for i from 1 to n:\n           calculate the i-th even number as 2 * i\n           raise this even number to the fifth power\n           add the result to sum\n       return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef even_Power_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n even numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th even number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Raise the even number to the fifth power\n        power_five = even_number ** 5\n        # Add the result to the total sum\n        total_sum += power_five\n    \n    # Return the total sum\n    return total_sum\n```",
