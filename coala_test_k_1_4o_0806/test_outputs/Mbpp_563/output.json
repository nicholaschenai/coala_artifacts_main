    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that extracts and returns all the values enclosed in quotation marks from a given string. For example, given the string `'\"Python\", \"PHP\", \"Java\"'`, the function should return a list of strings: `['Python', 'PHP', 'Java']`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and look for pairs of quotation marks. Each time we find a pair, we extract the substring between them and add it to a list. We continue this process until we have processed the entire string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function extract_values(s):\n       Initialize an empty list called results to store the extracted values\n       Initialize a variable i to 0 to keep track of the current position in the string\n\n       while i is less than the length of s:\n           If the character at position i is a quotation mark:\n               Find the next quotation mark after position i\n               Extract the substring between the two quotation marks\n               Add the extracted substring to the results list\n               Move i to the position after the second quotation mark\n           Otherwise, increment i by 1\n\n       Return the results list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_values(s: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted values\n    results = []\n    # Initialize the index to start from the beginning of the string\n    i = 0\n\n    # Loop through the string until the end\n    while i < len(s):\n        # Check if the current character is a quotation mark\n        if s[i] == '\"':\n            # Find the next quotation mark\n            j = i + 1\n            while j < len(s) and s[j] != '\"':\n                j += 1\n            # Extract the substring between the quotation marks\n            if j < len(s):\n                results.append(s[i+1:j])\n            # Move the index to the position after the second quotation mark\n            i = j\n        # Move to the next character\n        i += 1\n\n    # Return the list of extracted values\n    return results\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the string, identifies pairs of quotation marks, and extracts the substrings between them, adding each to a list. The function then returns this list.",
