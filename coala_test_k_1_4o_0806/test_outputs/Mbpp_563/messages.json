The function should return these values as a list of strings.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate through the input string and look for double quotation marks.\n   - When we find an opening quotation mark, we will start collecting characters until we find the corresponding closing quotation mark.\n   - Once we find the closing quotation mark, we will store the collected characters as a string in a list.\n   - We will continue this process until we have processed the entire string.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of extracted strings.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function extract_values with parameter input_string\n       Initialize an empty list called results\n       Initialize a variable i to 0\n       While i is less than the length of input_string\n           If the character at index i is a double quote\n               Increment i to move past the opening quote\n               Initialize an empty string called value\n               While i is less than the length of input_string and character at index i is not a double quote\n                   Append character at index i to value\n                   Increment i\n               Append value to results\n           Increment i\n       Return results\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_values(input_string: str) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the extracted values\n    results = []\n    # Initialize a counter to iterate through the string\n    i = 0\n    # Loop through the string\n    while i < len(input_string):\n        # Check if the current character is a double quote\n        if input_string[i] == '\"':\n            # Move to the next character after the opening quote\n            i += 1\n            # Initialize an empty string to collect the value\n            value = ''\n            # Collect characters until the next double quote is found\n            while i < len(input_string) and input_string[i] != '\"':\n                value += input_string[i]\n                i += 1\n            # Add the collected value to the results list\n            results.append(value)\n        # Move to the next character\n        i += 1\n    # Return the list of extracted values\n    return results\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the input string, identifies substrings enclosed in double quotes, and collects them into a list, which is then returned."

Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.\n\n\n        You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.\n\n        Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].\n\n\n        Examples:\n\n        s = \"3[a]2[bc]\", return \"aaabcbc\".\n        s = \"3[a2[c]]\", return \"accaccacc\".\n        s = \"2[abc]3[cd]ef\", return \"abcabccdcdcdef\".\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        None\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n           We are given a string that is encoded using a specific pattern. The pattern involves numbers followed by square brackets containing a substring. The number indicates how many times the substring inside the brackets should be repeated. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns and returning the fully decoded string.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the current state as we parse through the string. We will iterate over each character in the string:\n           - If we encounter a digit, we will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.\n           - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it indicates the start of a new encoded substring, so we push the current state (current string and repeat count) onto the stack.\n           - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded substring. We pop the last state from the stack, repeat the substring the specified number of times, and append it to the previous string.\n           - If we encounter a letter, we simply append it to the current string being built.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function decodeString(s):\n               Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and repeat counts\n               Initialize current_string as an empty string\n               Initialize current_num as 0\n\n               for each character in s:\n                   if character is a digit:\n                       Update current_num to include this digit\n                   else if character is '[':\n                       Push (current_string, current_num) onto the stack\n                       Reset current_string to empty and current_num to 0\n                   else if character is ']':\n                       Pop (prev_string, repeat_count) from the stack\n                       Update current_string to prev_string + (current_string repeated repeat_count times)\n                   else:\n                       Append character to current_string\n\n               return current_string\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:\n                # Initialize a stack to keep track of previous strings and repeat counts\n                stack = []\n                current_string = \"\"\n                current_num = 0\n\n                # Iterate over each character in the input string\n                for char in s:\n                    if char.isdigit():\n                        # If the character is a digit, update the current number\n                        current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)\n                    elif char == '[':\n                        # If the character is '[', push the current state onto the stack\n                        stack.append((current_string, current_num))\n                        # Reset current_string and current_num for the new context\n                        current_string = \"\"\n                        current_num = 0\n                    elif char == ']':\n                        # If the character is ']', pop the last state from the stack\n                        prev_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()\n                        # Repeat the current_string and append it to the previous string\n                        current_string = prev_string + current_string * repeat_count\n                    else:\n                        # If the character is a letter, append it to the current string\n                        current_string += char\n\n                # Return the fully decoded string\n                return current_string\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses a stack to manage nested structures and handles multiple digits for repeat counts, ensuring the correct decoding of the input string.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['\"3[a]2[bc]\"'] Output: \"aaabcbc\"\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
