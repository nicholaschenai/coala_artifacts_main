INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/616 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes two tuples of the same length and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain the result of performing the modulo operation on corresponding elements from the two input tuples.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input**: Two tuples of the same length.
2. **Output**: A new tuple where each element is the result of the modulo operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples.
3. **Process**:
   - Iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements, compute the modulo of the first element by the second element.
   - Collect these results into a new tuple.
   - Return the new tuple.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `tuple_modulo` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
2. Initialize an empty list `result`.
3. Loop over the indices of the tuples:
   - Compute the modulo of the element at the current index in `tuple1` by the element at the same index in `tuple2`.
   - Append the result to the `result` list.
4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple.
5. Return the resulting tuple.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def tuple_modulo(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the modulo operations
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples
    for i in range(len(tuple1)):
        # Compute the modulo of the elements at the current index
        mod_result = tuple1[i] % tuple2[i]
        # Append the result to the list
        result.append(mod_result)
    
    # Convert the list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)

Also, here are some of your memories.
Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.
