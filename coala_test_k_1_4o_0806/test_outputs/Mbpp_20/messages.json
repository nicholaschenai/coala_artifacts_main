        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given number is a Woodall number. A Woodall number is defined as a number of the form \\( n \\times 2^n - 1 \\) for some integer \\( n \\geq 1 \\). The function should return `True` if the input number is a Woodall number and `False` otherwise.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if a number is a Woodall number, we can iterate over possible values of \\( n \\) starting from 1. For each \\( n \\), we calculate the Woodall number using the formula \\( n \\times 2^n - 1 \\). If this calculated number matches the input number, then the input is a Woodall number, and we return `True`. If the calculated number exceeds the input number, we can stop the iteration and return `False` since Woodall numbers increase as \\( n \\) increases.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function is_woodall(x):\n       n = 1\n       while True:\n           calculate woodall_number = n * 2^n - 1\n           if woodall_number == x:\n               return True\n           if woodall_number > x:\n               return False\n           increment n by 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_woodall(x: int) -> bool:\n    # Start with n = 1\n    n = 1\n    while True:\n        # Calculate the Woodall number for the current n\n        woodall_number = n * (2 ** n) - 1\n        # Check if the calculated Woodall number matches the input number\n        if woodall_number == x:\n            return True\n        # If the calculated Woodall number exceeds the input number, stop and return False\n        if woodall_number > x:\n            return False\n        # Increment n to check the next possible Woodall number\n        n += 1\n```\n\nThis code will correctly determine if a given number is a Woodall number by iterating through possible values of \\( n \\) and checking if the formula \\( n \\times 2^n - 1 \\) matches the input number."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Reflection]:\n    The problem of reducing a number `n` to `1` using the minimum number of operations is a classic example of a greedy algorithm. The official solution and my approach both employ a similar strategy, but the official solution provides a more concise and potentially more efficient implementation.\n\n    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution:\n\n    1. **Iterative Approach**: The official solution uses an iterative approach rather than a recursive one. This avoids the overhead of recursive function calls and potential stack overflow issues for large values of `n`.\n\n    2. **Bitwise Operations**: The official solution uses bitwise operations to check if `n` is even (`n & 1`), which is a common and efficient technique in competitive programming.\n\n    3. **Handling Odd Numbers**: The solution uses a simple condition to decide whether to increment or decrement an odd number:\n       - If `n % 4 == 1` or `n == 3`, it decrements `n`.\n       - Otherwise, it increments `n`.\n       This approach is efficient because it leverages the properties of numbers modulo 4 to decide the optimal path.\n\n    4. **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient in both time and space. It operates in O(log n) time complexity due to the division by 2 operation, and it uses constant space since it doesn't rely on recursion.\n\n    ### Reflection:\n\n    The official solution is insightful in its use of bitwise operations and its concise handling of odd numbers. It demonstrates the importance of understanding number properties (like modulo operations) to make optimal decisions in greedy algorithms. This problem reinforces the value of iterative solutions for problems that can be expressed recursively, especially when dealing with large input sizes.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
