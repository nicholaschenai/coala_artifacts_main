INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/476 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the smallest and largest numbers in that list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Identify the smallest number in the list.
2. Identify the largest number in the list.
3. Calculate the sum of these two numbers.
4. Return the calculated sum.

### Pseudocode

```
function big_sum(arr):
    smallest = find the minimum value in arr
    largest = find the maximum value in arr
    result = smallest + largest
    return result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def big_sum(arr):
    # Find the smallest number in the array
    smallest = min(arr)
    # Find the largest number in the array
    largest = max(arr)
    # Calculate the sum of the smallest and largest numbers
    result = smallest + largest
    # Return the result
    return result
```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Prefix Sum Optimization**: My approach used a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.

    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.

    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.

    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.
