INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/111 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of lists (nested lists) as input and returns the common elements that appear in all of these lists. The function should return these common elements as a list.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Problem**: We need to find elements that are present in every list within a list of lists.
2. **Approach**:
   - Start with the first list and assume all its elements are common.
   - For each subsequent list, update the set of common elements by keeping only those elements that are also present in the current list.
   - By the end of the iteration through all lists, the remaining elements in the set will be those that are common to all lists.
3. **Output**: Return the common elements as a list.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize a set with the elements of the first list.
2. For each subsequent list:
   - Update the set of common elements by intersecting it with the current list.
3. Convert the set of common elements to a list and return it.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):
    # Start with the first list's elements as a set
    common_elements = set(nested_lists[0])
    
    # Iterate over the remaining lists
    for lst in nested_lists[1:]:
        # Update the common elements by intersecting with the current list
        common_elements.intersection_update(lst)
    
    # Return the common elements as a list
    return list(common_elements)
```

This solution efficiently finds the common elements by leveraging set operations, which are generally faster for membership tests and intersections compared to list operations. The use of `intersection_update` ensures that we only keep elements that are present in all lists.

        So you have again to build a method, that creates new arrays, that can be flattened!

        # Shorter: You have to unflatten a list/an array.

        You get an array of integers and have to unflatten it by these rules:
        ```
        - You have to do several runs. The depth is the number of runs, you have to do.
        - In every run you have to switch the direction. First run from left, next run from right. Next left...
        Every run has these rules:
        - You start at the first number (from the direction).
        - Take for every number x the remainder of the division by the number of still available elements (from 
          this position!) to have the number for the next decision.
        - If the remainder-value is smaller than 3, take this number x (NOT the remainder-Value) direct
          for the new array and continue with the next number.
        - If the remainder-value (e.g. 3) is greater than 2, take the next remainder-value-number (e.g. 3)
          elements/numbers (inclusive the number x, NOT the remainder-value) as a sub-array in the new array.
          Continue with the next number/element AFTER this taken elements/numbers.
        - Every sub-array in the array is independent and is only one element for the progress on the array. 
          For every sub-array you have to follow the same rules for unflatten it.
          The direction is always the same as the actual run.
        ```

        Sounds complicated? Yeah, thats why, this is the harder version...
        Maybe an example will help.

        ```
         Array: [4, 5, 1, 7, 1] Depth: 2 -> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]
 
        Steps: 
        First run: (start from left side!)
        1. The first number is 4. The number is smaller than the number of remaining elements, so it is the remainder-value (4 / 5 -> remainder 4).
           So 4 numbers (4, 5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the new array.
        2. The next number is 1. It is smaller than 3, so the 1 is added direct to the new array.
        Now we have --> [[4, 5, 1, 7], 1]

        Second run: (start from right side!)
        1. The last number (first from other side) is 1. So the 1 is added direct to the new array.
        2. The next element is the sub-array. So we use the rules for this.
        2a.The last number is 7. There are 4 elements in the array. So for the next decision you have to
           take the remainder from 7 / 4 -> 3. So 3 numbers (5, 1, 7) are added as sub-array in the 
           new array.
        2b.Now there is the 4 and only one element last in this array. 4 / 1 -> remainder 0. It is smaller
           than 3. So the 4 is added direct to the new array.
        Now we have --> [[ 4, [ 5, 1, 7 ] ], 1]
        ```

        The given array will always contain numbers. There will only be numbers > 0.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We need to transform a list of integers into a nested list structure based on specific rules. The transformation process involves multiple runs, alternating the direction of processing (left-to-right, then right-to-left, and so on). Each run involves checking each number in the list and deciding whether to include it directly or as part of a sub-array, based on the remainder of the division of the number by the count of remaining elements.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Initialize the Process**: Start with the given list and the specified depth of transformation.

        2. **Iterate Over Depth**: For each depth level, process the list in alternating directions:
           - **Left-to-Right**: Start from the beginning of the list.
           - **Right-to-Left**: Start from the end of the list.

        3. **Process Each Element**:
           - Calculate the remainder of the current element divided by the number of remaining elements.
           - If the remainder is less than 3, add the element directly to the new list.
           - If the remainder is 3 or more, create a sub-array with the next `remainder` elements and add it to the new list.

        4. **Recursive Processing**: If a sub-array is created, apply the same rules recursively to the sub-array.

        5. **Output the Result**: After processing all depth levels, the list should be fully transformed.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function unflatten(flat_array, depth):
            for each level in depth:
                if level is even:
                    process from left to right
                else:
                    process from right to left
        
                initialize new_array
                while there are elements in flat_array:
                    calculate remainder = current_element % remaining_elements
                    if remainder < 3:
                        add current_element to new_array
                    else:
                        create sub-array with next 'remainder' elements
                        add sub-array to new_array
                        skip 'remainder' elements in flat_array
        
                set flat_array to new_array for next level

            return flat_array
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def process_subarray(array, direction):
            result = []
            i = 0 if direction == 'left' else len(array) - 1
            step = 1 if direction == 'left' else -1
    
            while 0 <= i < len(array):
                remaining_elements = len(array) - i if direction == 'left' else i + 1
                current = array[i]
                remainder = current % remaining_elements
        
                if remainder < 3:
                    result.append(current)
                    i += step
                else:
                    if direction == 'left':
                        subarray = array[i:i + remainder]
                        result.append(process_subarray(subarray, direction))
                        i += remainder
                    else:
                        subarray = array[i - remainder + 1:i + 1]
                        result.append(process_subarray(subarray, direction))
                        i -= remainder
    
            return result

        def unflatten(flat_array, depth):
            direction = 'left'
            for _ in range(depth):
                flat_array = process_subarray(flat_array, direction)
                direction = 'right' if direction == 'left' else 'left'
    
            return flat_array
        ```

        ### Explanation

        - **process_subarray**: This helper function processes a given array in a specified direction ('left' or 'right'). It calculates the remainder for each element and decides whether to add it directly or as part of a sub-array.
        - **unflatten**: This function manages the overall process, iterating over the specified depth and alternating the direction of processing. It uses `process_subarray` to transform the list at each depth level.
