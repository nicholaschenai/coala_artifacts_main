    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that finds the common elements in a list of nested lists. Each nested list contains integers, and we need to identify which integers appear in every nested list.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Identify the First List**: Start with the first list in the nested lists as a reference for comparison.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Remaining Lists**: For each subsequent list, compare it with the current set of common elements.\n\n3. **Find Common Elements**: Use set intersection to find elements that are common between the current set of common elements and the current list.\n\n4. **Update Common Elements**: Update the set of common elements with the result of the intersection.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: After processing all lists, return the final set of common elements.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n    if nested_lists is empty:\n        return empty list\n\n    initialize common_elements with the first list converted to a set\n\n    for each list in nested_lists starting from the second:\n        convert the list to a set\n        update common_elements with the intersection of common_elements and the current set\n\n    return the list of common_elements\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef common_in_nested_lists(nested_lists):\n    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list\n    if not nested_lists:\n        return []\n\n    # Initialize the common elements with the first list converted to a set\n    common_elements = set(nested_lists[0])\n\n    # Iterate over the remaining lists\n    for lst in nested_lists[1:]:\n        # Update the common elements by intersecting with the current list converted to a set\n        common_elements.intersection_update(lst)\n\n    # Return the common elements as a list\n    return list(common_elements)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: We start by converting the first list into a set, which will serve as our initial set of common elements.\n- **Iterate and Intersect**: For each subsequent list, we convert it to a set and update the `common_elements` set by intersecting it with the current list's set. This ensures that only elements present in all lists remain in `common_elements`.\n- **Return**: Finally, we convert the set of common elements back to a list and return it. This list contains all elements that are common to every nested list.",
