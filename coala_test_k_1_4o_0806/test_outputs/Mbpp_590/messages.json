The function should take two inputs: the radius and the angle in polar coordinates, and return two outputs: the rectangular coordinates in both Cartesian form and complex number form.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Polar to Rectangular Conversion**:\n   - Polar coordinates are given as (r, \u03b8), where `r` is the radius and `\u03b8` is the angle in radians.\n   - Rectangular coordinates (Cartesian) are given as (x, y).\n   - The conversion formulas are:\n     - \\( x = r \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) \\)\n     - \\( y = r \\cdot \\sin(\\theta) \\)\n\n2. **Complex Number Representation**:\n   - A complex number can be represented as \\( x + yi \\).\n   - Using the rectangular coordinates, the complex form is \\( x + yi \\).\n\n3. **Steps to Solve**:\n   - Calculate the Cartesian coordinates using the conversion formulas.\n   - Construct the complex number using the calculated Cartesian coordinates.\n   - Return both the Cartesian coordinates and the complex number.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `polar_rect(r, theta)`.\n2. Calculate `x` as `r * cos(theta)`.\n3. Calculate `y` as `r * sin(theta)`.\n4. Create a tuple for Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)`.\n5. Create a complex number `x + yj`.\n6. Return both the Cartesian coordinates and the complex number.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef polar_rect(r: float, theta: float):\n    # Calculate the Cartesian coordinates\n    x = r * math.cos(theta)\n    y = r * math.sin(theta)\n    \n    # Create the Cartesian coordinates tuple\n    cartesian_coords = (x, y)\n    \n    # Create the complex number\n    complex_number = complex(x, y)\n    \n    # Return both the Cartesian coordinates and the complex number\n    return cartesian_coords, complex_number\n```\n\nThis solution calculates the Cartesian coordinates using the polar to rectangular conversion formulas and constructs a complex number using these coordinates. It then returns both the Cartesian coordinates and the complex number as required."

problems, it is often challenging\n    to find a way to approach the problem so that\n    the solution to the problem can be conveniently implemented\n    and the number of special cases is small.\n\n    As an example, consider a problem where\n    we are given the vertices of a quadrilateral\n    (a polygon that has four vertices),\n    and our task is to calculate its area.\n    For example, a possible input for the problem is as follows:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (5,6) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[thick] (6,2) -- (5,6) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    One way to approach the problem is to divide\n    the quadrilateral into two triangles by a straight\n    line between two opposite vertices:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (5,6) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];\n\n    \\draw[thick] (6,2) -- (5,6) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);\n    \\draw[dashed,thick] (2,5) -- (6,2);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    After this, it suffices to sum the areas\n    of the triangles.\n    The area of a triangle can be calculated,\n    for example, using \\key{Heron's formula}\n    %\\footnote{Heron of Alexandria (c. 10--70) was a Greek mathematician.}\n    \\[ \\sqrt{s (s-a) (s-b) (s-c)},\\]\n    where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are the lengths\n    of the triangle's sides and\n    $s=(a+b+c)/2$.\n    \\index{Heron's formula}\n\n    This is a possible way to solve the problem,\n    but there is one pitfall:\n    how to divide the quadrilateral into triangles?\n    It turns out that sometimes we cannot just pick\n    two arbitrary opposite vertices.\n    For example, in the following situation,\n    the division line is \\emph{outside} the quadrilateral:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (3,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[thick] (6,2) -- (3,2) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);\n\n    \\draw[dashed,thick] (2,5) -- (6,2);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    However, another way to draw the line works:\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[fill] (6,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (3,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (2,5) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[fill] (1,1) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[thick] (6,2) -- (3,2) -- (2,5) -- (1,1) -- (6,2);\n\n    \\draw[dashed,thick] (3,2) -- (1,1);\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n    It is clear for a human which of the lines is the correct\n    choice, but the situation is difficult for a computer.\n                           \n    However, it turns out that we can solve the problem using\n    another method that is more convenient to a programmer.\n    Namely, there is a general formula\n    \\[x_1y_2-x_2y_1+x_2y_3-x_3y_2+x_3y_4-x_4y_3+x_4y_1-x_1y_4,\\]\n    that calculates the area of a quadrilateral\n    whose vertices are\n    $(x_1,y_1)$,\n    $(x_2,y_2)$,\n    $(x_3,y_3)$ and\n    $(x_4,y_4)$.\n    This formula is easy to implement, there are no special\n    cases, and we can even generalize the formula\n    to \\emph{all} polygons.\n\n    \\section{Complex numbers}\n\n    \\index{complex number}\n    \\index{point}\n    \\index{vector}\n\n    A \\key{complex number} is a number of the form $x+y i$,\n    where $i = \\sqrt{-1}$ is the \\key{imaginary unit}.\n    A geometric interpretation of a complex number is\n    that it represents a two-dimensional point $(x,y)$\n    or a vector from the origin to a point $(x,y)$.\n\n    For example, $4+2i$ corresponds to the\n    following point and vector:\n\n    \\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.45]\n\n    \\draw[->,thick] (-5,0)--(5,0);\n    \\draw[->,thick] (0,-5)--(0,5);\n\n    \\draw[fill] (4,2) circle [radius=0.1];\n    \\draw[->,thick] (0,0)--(4-0.1,2-0.1);\n\n    \\node at (4,2.8) {$(4,2)$};\n    \\end{tikzpicture}\n    \\end{center}\n\n    \\index{complex@\\texttt{complex}}\n\n    The C++ complex number class \\texttt{complex} is\n    useful when solving geometric problems.\n    Using the class we can represent points and vectors\n    as complex numbers, and the class contains tools\n    that are useful in geometry.\n\n    In the following code, \\texttt{C} is the type of\n    a coordinate and \\texttt{P} is the type of a point or a vector.\n    In addition, the code defines macros \\texttt{X} and \\texttt{Y}\n    that can be used to refer to x and y coordinates.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    typedef long long C;\n    typedef complex<C> P;\n    #define X real()\n    #define Y imag()\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    For example, the following code defines a point $p=(4,2)$\n    and prints its x and y coordinates:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P p = {4,2};\n    cout << p.X << \" \" << p.Y << \"\\n\"; // 4 2\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The following code defines vectors $v=(3,1)$ and $u=(2,2)$,\n    and after that calculates the sum $s=v+u$.\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P v = {3,1};\n    P u = {2,2};\n    P s = v+u;\n    cout << s.X << \" \" << s.Y << \"\\n\"; // 5 3\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    In practice,\n    an appropriate coordinate type is usually\n    \\texttt{long long} (integer) or \\texttt{long double}\n    (real number).\n    It is a good idea to use integer whenever possible,\n    because calculations with integers are exact.\n    If real numbers are needed,\n    precision errors should be taken into account\n    when comparing numbers.\n    A safe way to check if real numbers $a$ and $b$ are equal\n    is to compare them using $|a-b|<\\epsilon$,\n    where $\\epsilon$ is a small number (for example, $\\epsilon=10^{-9}$).\n\n    \\subsubsection*{Functions}\n\n    In the following examples, the coordinate type is\n    \\texttt{long double}.\n\n    The function $\\texttt{abs}(v)$ calculates the length\n    $|v|$ of a vector $v=(x,y)$\n    using the formula $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.\n    The function can also be used for\n    calculating the distance between points\n    $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$,\n    because that distance equals the length\n    of the vector $(x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1)$.\n\n    The following code calculates the distance\n    between points $(4,2)$ and $(3,-1)$:\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P a = {4,2};\n    P b = {3,-1};\n    cout << abs(b-a) << \"\\n\"; // 3.16228\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n\n    The function $\\texttt{arg}(v)$ calculates the\n    angle of a vector $v=(x,y)$ with respect to the x axis.\n    The function gives the angle in radians,\n    where $r$ radians equals $180 r/\\pi$ degrees.\n    The angle of a vector that points to the right is 0,\n    and angles decrease clockwise and increase\n    counterclockwise.\n\n    The function $\\texttt{polar}(s,a)$ constructs a vector\n    whose length is $s$ and that points to an angle $a$.\n    A vector can be rotated by an angle $a$\n    by multiplying it by a vector with length 1 and angle $a$.\n\n    The following code calculates the angle of\n    the vector $(4,2)$, rotates it $1/2$ radians\n    counterclockwise, and then calculates the angle again:\n\n    \\begin{lstlisting}\n    P v = {4,2};\n    cout << arg(v) << \"\\n\"; // 0.463648\n    v *= polar(1.0,0.5);\n    cout << arg(v) << \"\\n\"; // 0.963648\n    \\end{lstlisting}\n[/Textbook Reference Material]\n\n"

The key challenge was correctly transforming the coordinate system to align the rectangle with the given slope.\n\n    ### Insights from the Official Solution\n\n    1. **Coordinate Transformation**:\n       - The official solution uses a transformation based on trigonometric identities to align the rectangle with the slope M. Specifically, it calculates the cosine and sine of the angle derived from the slope M using the formula:\n         \\[\n         \\text{cos}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}}, \\quad \\text{sin}(\\theta) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}}\n         \\]\n       - This transformation is more direct and avoids the need for calculating the angle explicitly using `atan`.\n\n    2. **Efficiency**:\n       - The solution efficiently computes the transformed coordinates and directly calculates the bounds (min and max) for these coordinates to determine the rectangle's dimensions.\n       - This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, as it processes each point in constant time and uses minimal additional space.\n\n    3. **Perimeter Calculation**:\n       - The perimeter is calculated using the differences between the maximum and minimum transformed coordinates, which directly gives the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways\n\n    - **Trigonometric Transformations**: Using trigonometric identities can simplify the transformation process, especially when dealing with slopes and angles.\n    - **Direct Calculation**: Avoid unnecessary calculations by directly using mathematical properties (like the Pythagorean identity) to derive needed values.\n    - **Precision**: Ensure that calculations maintain precision, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic, to meet problem constraints.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric transformations and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify complex problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The key challenge was correctly transforming the coordinate system to align the rectangle with the given slope.\n\n    ### Insights from the Official Solution\n\n    1. **Coordinate Transformation**:\n       - The official solution uses a transformation based on trigonometric identities to align the rectangle with the slope M. Specifically, it calculates the cosine and sine of the angle derived from the slope M using the formula:\n         \\[\n         \\text{cos}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}}, \\quad \\text{sin}(\\theta) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{1 + M^2}}\n         \\]\n       - This transformation is more direct and avoids the need for calculating the angle explicitly using `atan`.\n\n    2. **Efficiency**:\n       - The solution efficiently computes the transformed coordinates and directly calculates the bounds (min and max) for these coordinates to determine the rectangle's dimensions.\n       - This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient, as it processes each point in constant time and uses minimal additional space.\n\n    3. **Perimeter Calculation**:\n       - The perimeter is calculated using the differences between the maximum and minimum transformed coordinates, which directly gives the side lengths of the rectangle in the transformed space.\n\n    ### Key Takeaways\n\n    - **Trigonometric Transformations**: Using trigonometric identities can simplify the transformation process, especially when dealing with slopes and angles.\n    - **Direct Calculation**: Avoid unnecessary calculations by directly using mathematical properties (like the Pythagorean identity) to derive needed values.\n    - **Precision**: Ensure that calculations maintain precision, especially when dealing with floating-point arithmetic, to meet problem constraints.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding geometric transformations and leveraging mathematical properties to simplify complex problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
