For the least significant bit (which determines evenness), if both numbers are even or both are odd, the result will be even.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n   - Count the number of even numbers and the number of odd numbers in the list.\n   - Calculate the number of pairs of even numbers and the number of pairs of odd numbers.\n   - The total number of pairs that XOR to an even number is the sum of these two counts.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - Initialize counters for even and odd numbers.\n   - Iterate through the list and update the counters based on the parity of each number.\n   - Calculate the number of pairs of even numbers using the combination formula `nC2 = n * (n - 1) / 2`.\n   - Calculate the number of pairs of odd numbers using the same formula.\n   - Return the sum of these two values.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_even_pair(nums):\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    \n    for each number in nums:\n        if number is even:\n            increment even_count\n        else:\n            increment odd_count\n    \n    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2\n    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2\n    \n    return even_pairs + odd_pairs\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_even_pair(nums):\n    # Initialize counters for even and odd numbers\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    \n    # Count the number of even and odd numbers in the list\n    for num in nums:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n    \n    # Calculate the number of pairs of even numbers\n    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2\n    # Calculate the number of pairs of odd numbers\n    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Return the total number of pairs that XOR to an even number\n    return even_pairs + odd_pairs\n```"

We need to find the number of continuous subarrays (subsequences of consecutive elements) in `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. \n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify the positions of odd numbers in the array. This will help us in determining the subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.\n\n        2. **Use Two Pointers**: We can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. The idea is to maintain a window that contains exactly `k` odd numbers and count the number of such windows.\n\n        3. **Count Subarrays**: For each valid window (subarray) that contains exactly `k` odd numbers, we can extend the window to the left and right to count all possible subarrays that still contain exactly `k` odd numbers.\n\n        4. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the array, adjusting the window size using the two pointers, and count the number of valid subarrays.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start of the array.\n        2. Initialize a counter `odd_count` to count the number of odd numbers in the current window.\n        3. Initialize a variable `result` to store the number of nice subarrays.\n        4. Iterate `right` over the array:\n           - If `nums[right]` is odd, increment `odd_count`.\n           - While `odd_count` is greater than `k`, increment `left` and decrement `odd_count` if `nums[left]` is odd.\n           - If `odd_count` equals `k`, count the number of subarrays ending at `right` with exactly `k` odd numbers.\n        5. Return `result`.\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n                def count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k):\n                    left = 0\n                    odd_count = 0\n                    result = 0\n                    for right in range(len(nums)):\n                        if nums[right] % 2 == 1:\n                            odd_count += 1\n                        while odd_count > k:\n                            if nums[left] % 2 == 1:\n                                odd_count -= 1\n                            left += 1\n                        result += right - left + 1\n                    return result\n        \n                # The number of subarrays with exactly k odd numbers is the difference\n                # between the number of subarrays with at most k odd numbers and the\n                # number of subarrays with at most k-1 odd numbers.\n                return count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k) - count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k - 1)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code\n\n        - The function `count_at_most_k_odd` calculates the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers using a sliding window approach.\n        - The main function `numberOfSubarrays` calculates the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by subtracting the number of subarrays with at most `k-1` odd numbers from the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers. This is based on the principle that the difference gives us the exact count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [[1, 1, 2, 1, 1], 3] Output: 2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
