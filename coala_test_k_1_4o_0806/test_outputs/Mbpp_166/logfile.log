INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/166 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and counts how many pairs of integers in the list have an XOR result that is an even number.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understanding XOR and Even Numbers**: 
   - XOR of two numbers is even if both numbers have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).
   - This is because XOR results in a binary number where a bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the operands are different. For the least significant bit (which determines evenness), if both numbers are even or both are odd, the result will be even.

2. **Approach**:
   - Count the number of even numbers and the number of odd numbers in the list.
   - Calculate the number of pairs of even numbers and the number of pairs of odd numbers.
   - The total number of pairs that XOR to an even number is the sum of these two counts.

3. **Steps**:
   - Initialize counters for even and odd numbers.
   - Iterate through the list and update the counters based on the parity of each number.
   - Calculate the number of pairs of even numbers using the combination formula `nC2 = n * (n - 1) / 2`.
   - Calculate the number of pairs of odd numbers using the same formula.
   - Return the sum of these two values.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_even_pair(nums):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    for each number in nums:
        if number is even:
            increment even_count
        else:
            increment odd_count
    
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_even_pair(nums):
    # Initialize counters for even and odd numbers
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Count the number of even and odd numbers in the list
    for num in nums:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of pairs of even numbers
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    # Calculate the number of pairs of odd numbers
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    
    # Return the total number of pairs that XOR to an even number
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We need to find the number of continuous subarrays (subsequences of consecutive elements) in `nums` that contain exactly `k` odd numbers. 

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify the positions of odd numbers in the array. This will help us in determining the subarrays that contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

        2. **Use Two Pointers**: We can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. The idea is to maintain a window that contains exactly `k` odd numbers and count the number of such windows.

        3. **Count Subarrays**: For each valid window (subarray) that contains exactly `k` odd numbers, we can extend the window to the left and right to count all possible subarrays that still contain exactly `k` odd numbers.

        4. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the array, adjusting the window size using the two pointers, and count the number of valid subarrays.

        ## Pseudocode

        1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start of the array.
        2. Initialize a counter `odd_count` to count the number of odd numbers in the current window.
        3. Initialize a variable `result` to store the number of nice subarrays.
        4. Iterate `right` over the array:
           - If `nums[right]` is odd, increment `odd_count`.
           - While `odd_count` is greater than `k`, increment `left` and decrement `odd_count` if `nums[left]` is odd.
           - If `odd_count` equals `k`, count the number of subarrays ending at `right` with exactly `k` odd numbers.
        5. Return `result`.

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def numberOfSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
                def count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k):
                    left = 0
                    odd_count = 0
                    result = 0
                    for right in range(len(nums)):
                        if nums[right] % 2 == 1:
                            odd_count += 1
                        while odd_count > k:
                            if nums[left] % 2 == 1:
                                odd_count -= 1
                            left += 1
                        result += right - left + 1
                    return result
        
                # The number of subarrays with exactly k odd numbers is the difference
                # between the number of subarrays with at most k odd numbers and the
                # number of subarrays with at most k-1 odd numbers.
                return count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k) - count_at_most_k_odd(nums, k - 1)
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - The function `count_at_most_k_odd` calculates the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers using a sliding window approach.
        - The main function `numberOfSubarrays` calculates the number of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers by subtracting the number of subarrays with at most `k-1` odd numbers from the number of subarrays with at most `k` odd numbers. This is based on the principle that the difference gives us the exact count of subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/166 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. The XOR operation between two numbers results in an even number if both numbers are either even or both are odd.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Even and Odd Numbers**: We need to determine which numbers in the list are even and which are odd. This is because:
   - XOR of two even numbers is even.
   - XOR of two odd numbers is even.

2. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: Count the number of even numbers and the number of odd numbers in the list.

3. **Calculate Pairs**:
   - The number of pairs of even numbers is given by the combination formula `C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2`, where `n` is the number of even numbers.
   - Similarly, calculate the number of pairs of odd numbers using the same formula.

4. **Sum the Pairs**: The total number of pairs that XOR to an even number is the sum of the pairs of even numbers and the pairs of odd numbers.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize `even_count` and `odd_count` to 0.
2. Iterate over each number in the list:
   - If the number is even, increment `even_count`.
   - If the number is odd, increment `odd_count`.
3. Calculate the number of even pairs using the formula `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`.
4. Calculate the number of odd pairs using the formula `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.
5. Return the sum of even pairs and odd pairs.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_even_pair(numbers):
    # Initialize counters for even and odd numbers
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Count the number of even and odd numbers
    for number in numbers:
        if number % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of pairs of even numbers
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2

    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    
    # Return the total number of pairs that XOR to an even number
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first count the number of even and odd numbers in the list.
- We then calculate the number of pairs of even numbers and odd numbers separately using the combination formula for pairs.
- Finally, we return the sum of these pairs, which gives us the total number of pairs that XOR to an even number.
