    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the integer that appears most frequently in the list. If there is a tie, any of the most frequent integers can be returned.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each integer in the list. We will iterate through the list, updating the count for each integer in the dictionary. After counting, we will find the integer with the maximum count and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function max_occurrences with parameter lst:\n       Create an empty dictionary called frequency_count\n       For each number in lst:\n           If number is not in frequency_count:\n               Add number to frequency_count with value 1\n           Else:\n               Increment the value of number in frequency_count by 1\n       Initialize max_count to 0 and max_item to None\n       For each key, value pair in frequency_count:\n           If value is greater than max_count:\n               Set max_count to value\n               Set max_item to key\n       Return max_item\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_occurrences(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each number\n    frequency_count = {}\n    \n    # Count the occurrences of each number in the list\n    for number in lst:\n        if number not in frequency_count:\n            frequency_count[number] = 1\n        else:\n            frequency_count[number] += 1\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the maximum frequency and the corresponding number\n    max_count = 0\n    max_item = None\n    \n    # Find the number with the maximum frequency\n    for number, count in frequency_count.items():\n        if count > max_count:\n            max_count = count\n            max_item = number\n    \n    # Return the number with the maximum frequency\n    return max_item\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find and return the integer with the highest frequency in the given list. If there are multiple integers with the same maximum frequency, it will return one of them.",
