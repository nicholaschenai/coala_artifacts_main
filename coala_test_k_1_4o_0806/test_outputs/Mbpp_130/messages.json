Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the number that appears most frequently in the list. If there is a tie (multiple numbers with the same maximum frequency), we can return any one of them.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n- Create a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number in the list.\n- Iterate through the list and update the frequency count for each number in the dictionary.\n- After processing the entire list, find the number with the highest frequency in the dictionary.\n- Return the number with the maximum frequency.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction max_occurrences(lst):\n    create an empty dictionary called frequency_count\n    for each number in lst:\n        if number is in frequency_count:\n            increment its count by 1\n        else:\n            add number to frequency_count with a count of 1\n    initialize max_count to 0\n    initialize max_number to None\n    for each number, count in frequency_count:\n        if count is greater than max_count:\n            update max_count to count\n            update max_number to number\n    return max_number\n```\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef max_occurrences(lst):\n    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each number\n    frequency_count = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through the list to count the occurrences of each number\n    for number in lst:\n        if number in frequency_count:\n            frequency_count[number] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency_count[number] = 1\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the number with the maximum frequency\n    max_count = 0\n    max_number = None\n    \n    # Iterate through the frequency dictionary to find the number with the highest frequency\n    for number, count in frequency_count.items():\n        if count > max_count:\n            max_count = count\n            max_number = number\n    \n    # Return the number with the maximum frequency\n    return max_number\n```\n\nThis code will correctly find and return the number that appears most frequently in the given list."

The core concept involved efficiently determining the largest prime factor for each number up to 100,000, which was achieved using a sieve-like approach. This precomputation allowed for quick lookups during the test case processing.\n\n    Initially, the code failed to produce output due to the function not being called. This was a simple oversight that was corrected by explicitly calling the `solve()` function at the end of the script. This highlights the importance of ensuring that the main logic is executed, especially in environments where the function might not be automatically invoked.\n\n    The solution involved counting the frequency of the largest prime factors and selecting the one with the highest frequency, resolving ties by choosing the largest prime factor. This approach was efficient and worked well within the problem's constraints.\n\n    Key takeaways include the utility of precomputation for problems involving repeated calculations over a fixed range and the importance of verifying that all parts of the code are executed as intended. This experience reinforced the value of careful input handling and function execution in competitive programming environments.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
