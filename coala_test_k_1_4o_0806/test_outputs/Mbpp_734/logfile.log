INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/734 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to find the sum of the products of all possible sublists of a given list of numbers. A sublist is any contiguous portion of the list, including the list itself and individual elements.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We need to consider all possible sublists of the given list.
   - For each sublist, calculate the product of its elements.
   - Sum up all these products to get the final result.

   To achieve this:
   - Iterate over all possible starting points of sublists.
   - For each starting point, iterate over all possible ending points to form sublists.
   - Calculate the product of each sublist and add it to a running total.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Initialize total_sum to 0
   For each starting index i from 0 to length of list - 1:
       Initialize product to 1
       For each ending index j from i to length of list - 1:
           Multiply product by list[j]
           Add product to total_sum
   Return total_sum
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(lst):
    # Initialize the total sum of products to 0
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over each possible starting index of sublists
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        # Initialize the product for the current sublist starting at index i
        product = 1
        
        # Iterate over each possible ending index of sublists starting from i
        for j in range(i, len(lst)):
            # Multiply the current product by the element at index j
            product *= lst[j]
            
            # Add the current product to the total sum
            total_sum += product
    
    # Return the total sum of products of all sublists
    return total_sum
```

This code will correctly compute the sum of products of all possible sublists for a given list, as required by the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the main task was to compute the sums of all non-empty continuous subarrays of a given array, sort these sums, and then calculate the sum of a specified range of these sorted sums. The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.

    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:
    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.
    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.
    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.
    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:
            subarray_sums = []
            for start in range(n):
                current_sum = 0
                for end in range(start, n):
                    current_sum += nums[end]
                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)
            subarray_sums.sort()
            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])
            return result % (10**9 + 7)
    ```

    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.
