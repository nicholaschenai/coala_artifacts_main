INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/457 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the sublist with the smallest length. If there are multiple sublists with the same minimum length, the function should return the first one it encounters.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Start by assuming the first sublist is the shortest.
   - Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists.
   - For each sublist, compare its length to the current shortest sublist.
   - If a sublist is shorter, update the shortest sublist to this one.
   - After checking all sublists, return the shortest one found.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function Find_Min(list_of_lists):
       if list_of_lists is empty:
           return an empty list
       
       set shortest_sublist to the first sublist in list_of_lists
       
       for each sublist in list_of_lists:
           if length of sublist is less than length of shortest_sublist:
               set shortest_sublist to sublist
       
       return shortest_sublist
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def Find_Min(list_of_lists):
    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list
    if not list_of_lists:
        return []
    
    # Assume the first sublist is the shortest initially
    shortest_sublist = list_of_lists[0]
    
    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        # If the current sublist is shorter than the shortest found so far
        if len(sublist) < len(shortest_sublist):
            # Update the shortest sublist
            shortest_sublist = sublist
    
    # Return the shortest sublist found
    return shortest_sublist
```

This solution iterates through the list of lists once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of sublists. It correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a list of strings, and we need to find the shortest string that contains each of the given strings as a substring. None of the strings in the list is a substring of another. The solution should be able to handle up to 12 strings, each with a length of up to 20 characters.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach combined with dynamic programming. The idea is to iteratively merge strings by overlapping them as much as possible. We can calculate the overlap between two strings and use this information to build the shortest superstring. We will use a dynamic programming table to store the shortest superstring that can be formed using a subset of the strings, and we will update this table as we consider each string.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Define a function to calculate the overlap between two strings.
           Initialize a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset of strings.
           Initialize a table to store the path to reconstruct the superstring.
           For each subset of strings:
               For each string in the subset:
                   Calculate the shortest superstring by considering the overlap with other strings.
                   Update the DP table with the shortest superstring length.
                   Update the path table to keep track of the order of strings.
           Reconstruct the shortest superstring using the path table.
           Return the shortest superstring.
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        from typing import List

        class Solution:
            def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:

                def overlap(s1, s2):
                    max_overlap = 0

                                dp[mask][i] = dp[prev_mask][j] + o
                                path[mask][i] = j

                # Find the end of the shortest superstring
                max_len = -1
                last = -1
                full_mask = (1 << n) - 1
                for i in range(n):
                    if dp[full_mask][i] > max_len:
                        max_len = dp[full_mask][i]
                        last = i

                # Reconstruct the shortest superstring
                superstring = []
                mask = full_mask
                while last != -1:
                    superstring.append(last)
                    next_last = path[mask][last]
                    mask ^= (1 << last)
                    last = next_last

                # Build the final superstring
                superstring.reverse()
                result = A[superstring[0]]
                for k in range(1, len(superstring)):
                    i, j = superstring[k-1], superstring[k]
                    o = overlap(A[i], A[j])
                    result += A[j][o:]

                return result
        ```

        This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the shortest superstring by considering all possible overlaps between the strings. The `overlap` function calculates the maximum overlap between two strings, which is used to update the DP table. The `path` table helps reconstruct the order of strings in the final superstring.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/457 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We are given a list of sublists, and we need to find the sublist with the minimum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same minimum length, we can return any one of them.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each sublist in the given list and keep track of the sublist with the smallest length. We will initialize a variable to store the minimum length found so far and another variable to store the corresponding sublist. As we iterate, we will update these variables whenever we find a sublist with a smaller length than the current minimum.

   ```
   Initialize min_length to a large number
   Initialize min_sublist to None

   For each sublist in the list of sublists:
       If the length of the sublist is less than min_length:
