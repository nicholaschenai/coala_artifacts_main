    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We are given a list of sublists, and we need to find the sublist with the minimum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same minimum length, we can return any one of them.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each sublist in the given list and keep track of the sublist with the smallest length. We will initialize a variable to store the minimum length found so far and another variable to store the corresponding sublist. As we iterate, we will update these variables whenever we find a sublist with a smaller length than the current minimum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize min_length to a large number\n   Initialize min_sublist to None\n\n   For each sublist in the list of sublists:\n       If the length of the sublist is less than min_length:\n           Update min_length to the length of the sublist\n           Update min_sublist to the current sublist\n\n   Return min_sublist\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min(sublists):\n    # Initialize min_length to a large number\n    min_length = float('inf')\n    # Initialize min_sublist to None\n    min_sublist = None\n\n    # Iterate through each sublist in the list of sublists\n    for sublist in sublists:\n        # If the length of the current sublist is less than min_length\n        if len(sublist) < min_length:\n            # Update min_length to the length of the current sublist\n            min_length = len(sublist)\n            # Update min_sublist to the current sublist\n            min_sublist = sublist\n\n    # Return the sublist with the minimum length\n    return min_sublist\n```\n",
