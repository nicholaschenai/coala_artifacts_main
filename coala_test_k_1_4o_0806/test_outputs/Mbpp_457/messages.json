If there are multiple sublists with the same minimum length, the function should return the first one it encounters.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start by assuming the first sublist is the shortest.\n   - Iterate through each sublist in the list of lists.\n   - For each sublist, compare its length to the current shortest sublist.\n   - If a sublist is shorter, update the shortest sublist to this one.\n   - After checking all sublists, return the shortest one found.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function Find_Min(list_of_lists):\n       if list_of_lists is empty:\n           return an empty list\n       \n       set shortest_sublist to the first sublist in list_of_lists\n       \n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           if length of sublist is less than length of shortest_sublist:\n               set shortest_sublist to sublist\n       \n       return shortest_sublist\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef Find_Min(list_of_lists):\n    # If the input list is empty, return an empty list\n    if not list_of_lists:\n        return []\n    \n    # Assume the first sublist is the shortest initially\n    shortest_sublist = list_of_lists[0]\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # If the current sublist is shorter than the shortest found so far\n        if len(sublist) < len(shortest_sublist):\n            # Update the shortest sublist\n            shortest_sublist = sublist\n    \n    # Return the shortest sublist found\n    return shortest_sublist\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list of lists once, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of sublists. It correctly handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list."

None of the strings in the list is a substring of another.

The idea is to iteratively merge strings by overlapping them as much as possible. We can calculate the overlap between two strings and use this information to build the shortest superstring. We will use a dynamic programming table to store the shortest superstring that can be formed using a subset of the strings, and we will update this table as we consider each string.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           Define a function to calculate the overlap between two strings.\n           Initialize a DP table to store the shortest superstring for each subset of strings.\n           Initialize a table to store the path to reconstruct the superstring.\n           For each subset of strings:\n               For each string in the subset:\n                   Calculate the shortest superstring by considering the overlap with other strings.\n                   Update the DP table with the shortest superstring length.\n                   Update the path table to keep track of the order of strings.\n           Reconstruct the shortest superstring using the path table.\n           Return the shortest superstring.\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        from typing import List\n\n        class Solution:\n            def shortestSuperstring(self, A: List[str]) -> str:\n                # Helper function to calculate the overlap between two strings\n                def overlap(s1, s2):\n                    max_overlap = 0\n                    # Check all possible overlaps\n                    for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):\n                        if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:\n                            max_overlap = i\n                    return max_overlap\n\n                n = len(A)\n                # DP table to store the shortest superstring length for each subset\n                dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n                # Path table to reconstruct the superstring\n                path = [[-1] * n for _ in range(1 << n)]\n\n                # Fill the DP table\n                for mask in range(1, 1 << n):\n                    for i in range(n):\n                        if not (mask & (1 << i)):\n                            continue\n                        prev_mask = mask ^ (1 << i)\n                        if prev_mask == 0:\n                            continue\n                        for j in range(n):\n                            if not (prev_mask & (1 << j)):\n                                continue\n                            # Calculate overlap between A[j] and A[i]\n                            o = overlap(A[j], A[i])\n                            # Update DP table if a shorter superstring is found\n                            if dp[mask][i] < dp[prev_mask][j] + o:\n                                dp[mask][i] = dp[prev_mask][j] + o\n                                path[mask][i] = j\n\n                # Find the end of the shortest superstring\n                max_len = -1\n                last = -1\n                full_mask = (1 << n) - 1\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if dp[full_mask][i] > max_len:\n                        max_len = dp[full_mask][i]\n                        last = i\n\n                # Reconstruct the shortest superstring\n                superstring = []\n                mask = full_mask\n                while last != -1:\n                    superstring.append(last)\n                    next_last = path[mask][last]\n                    mask ^= (1 << last)\n                    last = next_last\n\n                # Build the final superstring\n                superstring.reverse()\n                result = A[superstring[0]]\n                for k in range(1, len(superstring)):\n                    i, j = superstring[k-1], superstring[k]\n                    o = overlap(A[i], A[j])\n                    result += A[j][o:]\n\n                return result\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently find the shortest superstring by considering all possible overlaps between the strings.
