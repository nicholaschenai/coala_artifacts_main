We need to compute the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays of `nums`, sort these sums in non-decreasing order, and then return the sum of the elements from index `left` to `right` (1-based index) in this sorted list. The result should be returned modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Generate Subarray Sums**: For each possible subarray in `nums`, calculate its sum. This involves iterating over all possible starting and ending indices of subarrays.\n\n        2. **Sort the Sums**: Once all subarray sums are computed, sort them in non-decreasing order.\n\n        3. **Calculate the Range Sum**: Sum the elements from the `left` to `right` indices in the sorted list of sums. Since the indices are 1-based, adjust them to 0-based for Python list indexing.\n\n        4. **Modulo Operation**: Return the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function rangeSum(nums, n, left, right):\n            subarray_sums = []\n    \n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n    \n            sort subarray_sums\n    \n            result = 0\n            for i from left-1 to right-1:\n                result += subarray_sums[i]\n    \n            return result modulo (10^9 + 7)\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n                # List to store all subarray sums\n                subarray_sums = []\n        \n                # Calculate all subarray sums\n                for start in range(n):\n                    current_sum = 0\n                    for end in range(start, n):\n                        current_sum += nums[end]\n                        subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n        \n                # Sort the subarray sums\n                subarray_sums.sort()\n        \n                # Calculate the sum from index left to right (1-based index)\n                result = 0\n                for i in range(left - 1, right):\n                    result += subarray_sums[i]\n        \n                # Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7\n                return result % (10**9 + 7)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code\n\n        - We first initialize an empty list `subarray_sums` to store the sums of all possible subarrays.\n        - We use two nested loops to iterate over all possible subarrays. The outer loop sets the starting index, and the inner loop calculates the sum for each subarray starting at that index.\n        - After computing all subarray sums, we sort them.\n        - We then sum the elements from the `left-1` to `right-1` indices in the sorted list (adjusting for 0-based indexing).\n        - Finally, we return the sum modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [[1, 2, 3, 4], 4, 1, 5] Output: 13\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
