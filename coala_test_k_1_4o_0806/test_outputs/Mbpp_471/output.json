    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes an array of integers and a number `n`. The function should compute the product of all the integers in the array and then return the remainder when this product is divided by `n`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize a Product Variable**: Start with a variable to hold the product of the array elements, initialized to 1.\n\n2. **Compute the Product**: Iterate through each element in the array, multiplying it with the product variable.\n\n3. **Compute the Remainder**: After calculating the product of all elements, compute the remainder of this product when divided by `n`.\n\n4. **Return the Remainder**: Return the computed remainder as the result.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_remainder(arr, n):\n    product = 1\n    for each element in arr:\n        product = product * element\n    remainder = product % n\n    return remainder\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_remainder(arr, n):\n    # Initialize the product to 1\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the product of all elements in the array\n    for element in arr:\n        product *= element\n    \n    # Calculate the remainder of the product divided by n\n    remainder = product % n\n    \n    # Return the remainder\n    return remainder\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- We initialize `product` to 1 because multiplying by 1 does not change the value, and it serves as a neutral element for multiplication.\n- We iterate over each element in the array `arr`, updating the `product` by multiplying it with the current element.\n- After the loop, we compute the remainder of the `product` when divided by `n` using the modulus operator `%`.\n- Finally, we return the computed remainder.",
