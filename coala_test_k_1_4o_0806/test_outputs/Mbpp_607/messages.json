        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that searches for a specific substring (pattern) within a given string. The function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, its starting index, and its ending index in the original string.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Search for the Pattern**: We need to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string.\n2. **Determine Indices**: Once the pattern is found, determine the starting and ending indices of this pattern in the string.\n3. **Return the Result**: Return a tuple containing the found substring, the start index, and the end index.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `find_literals` that takes two parameters: `text` (the string to search) and `pattern` (the substring to find).\n2. Use the `find` method of the string to locate the starting index of the pattern in the text.\n3. If the pattern is found (i.e., the starting index is not -1):\n   - Calculate the ending index as the starting index plus the length of the pattern.\n   - Return a tuple containing the pattern, the starting index, and the ending index.\n4. If the pattern is not found, return a tuple with empty string and two -1s to indicate no match.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_literals(text: str, pattern: str) -> tuple:\n    # Find the starting index of the pattern in the text\n    start_index = text.find(pattern)\n    \n    # Check if the pattern is found\n    if start_index != -1:\n        # Calculate the end index\n        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)\n        # Return the pattern, start index, and end index\n        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)\n    \n    # If pattern is not found, return a tuple indicating no match\n    return (\"\", -1, -1)\n```\n\nThis solution uses the `find` method to locate the pattern in the text, calculates the indices, and returns the required tuple. If the pattern is not found, it returns a tuple with an empty string and indices set to -1."

The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.\n\n    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.\n\n    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\n    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:\n    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.\n    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.\n    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

The function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, the starting index of the match, and the ending index of the match.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in string method `find()` to locate the starting index of the pattern within the string. If the pattern is found, we can calculate the ending index by adding the length of the pattern to the starting index. We then return a tuple containing the pattern, the starting index, and the ending index. If the pattern is not found, we should return a tuple with `None` values or handle it as per the requirements (though the problem does not specify this case).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function find_literals with parameters text and pattern\n       Find the starting index of pattern in text using find() method\n       If the starting index is not -1 (pattern is found)\n           Calculate the ending index as starting index + length of pattern\n           Return a tuple with the pattern, starting index, and ending index\n       Otherwise\n           Return a tuple with None values (or handle as needed)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_literals(text: str, pattern: str) -> tuple:\n    # Find the starting index of the pattern in the text\n    start_index = text.find(pattern)\n    \n    # Check if the pattern is found\n    if start_index != -1:\n        # Calculate the ending index\n        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)\n        # Return the pattern, start index, and end index\n        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)\n    \n    # If pattern is not found, return None values (or handle as needed)\n    return (None, None, None)\n```"
