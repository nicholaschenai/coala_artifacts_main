    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that searches for a specific substring (pattern) within a given string. The function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, the starting index of the match, and the ending index of the match.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in string method `find()` to locate the starting index of the pattern within the string. If the pattern is found, we can calculate the ending index by adding the length of the pattern to the starting index. We then return a tuple containing the pattern, the starting index, and the ending index. If the pattern is not found, we should return a tuple with `None` values or handle it as per the requirements (though the problem does not specify this case).\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function find_literals with parameters text and pattern\n       Find the starting index of pattern in text using find() method\n       If the starting index is not -1 (pattern is found)\n           Calculate the ending index as starting index + length of pattern\n           Return a tuple with the pattern, starting index, and ending index\n       Otherwise\n           Return a tuple with None values (or handle as needed)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_literals(text: str, pattern: str) -> tuple:\n    # Find the starting index of the pattern in the text\n    start_index = text.find(pattern)\n    \n    # Check if the pattern is found\n    if start_index != -1:\n        # Calculate the ending index\n        end_index = start_index + len(pattern)\n        # Return the pattern, start index, and end index\n        return (pattern, start_index, end_index)\n    \n    # If pattern is not found, return None values (or handle as needed)\n    return (None, None, None)\n```",
