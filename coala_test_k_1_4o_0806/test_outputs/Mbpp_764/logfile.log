INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/764 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that counts the number of digit characters in a given string. A digit character is any character from '0' to '9'.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a counter to zero. This counter will keep track of the number of digit characters in the string.
2. Iterate over each character in the string.
3. For each character, check if it is a digit.
4. If the character is a digit, increment the counter by one.
5. After iterating through the entire string, return the counter value, which represents the number of digit characters in the string.

## Pseudocode

```
function number_ctr(s):
    initialize counter to 0
    for each character in string s:
        if character is a digit:
            increment counter by 1
    return counter
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def number_ctr(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of digits
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is a digit
        if char.isdigit():
            # Increment the counter if it is a digit
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of digit characters
    return count
```

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We need to create a function that evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string. The expression can include non-negative integers, the operators `+` and `-`, parentheses `(` and `)`, and spaces. The function should return the result of the expression as an integer. We cannot use Python's `eval` function.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to handle the operations and parentheses. We will iterate through the string character by character. When we encounter a number, we will parse it and push it onto a stack. When we encounter an operator, we will apply it to the top numbers on the stack. Parentheses will be used to control the order of operations, and we will use a stack to manage them. Spaces will be ignored. The final result will be the value left on the stack after processing the entire string.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           Initialize a stack to store numbers and results
           Initialize a variable to store the current number
           Initialize a variable to store the current sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative)
           Initialize a variable to store the result

           Iterate over each character in the string:
               If the character is a digit:
                   Update the current number by appending the digit
               If the character is a '+' or '-':
                   Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result
                   Update the sign based on the character
                   Reset the current number to 0
               If the character is '(':
                   Push the current result and sign onto the stack
                   Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression
               If the character is ')':
                   Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result
                   Pop the sign and previous result from the stack and update the result
                   Reset the current number to 0
               Ignore spaces

           After the loop, add the last number to the result
           Return the result
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
                # Initialize a stack to store results and signs
                stack = []
                # Initialize the current number, result, and sign
                current_number = 0
                result = 0
                sign = 1
        
                # Iterate over each character in the string
                for char in s:
                    if char.isdigit():
                        # Build the current number
                        current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
                    elif char == '+':
                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                        result += sign * current_number
                        # Update the sign to positive
                        sign = 1
                        # Reset the current number
                        current_number = 0
                    elif char == '-':
                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                        result += sign * current_number
                        # Update the sign to negative
                        sign = -1
                        # Reset the current number
                        current_number = 0
                    elif char == '(':
                        # Push the current result and sign onto the stack
                        stack.append(result)
                        stack.append(sign)
                        # Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression
                        result = 0
                        sign = 1
                    elif char == ')':
                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign
                        result += sign * current_number
                        # Pop the sign and previous result from the stack
                        result *= stack.pop()  # this is the sign
                        result += stack.pop()  # this is the previous result
                        # Reset the current number
                        current_number = 0
        
                # Add the last number to the result
                result += sign * current_number
                return result
        ```

        This solution uses a stack to manage the results and signs, processes each character in the string, and correctly handles parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.
