    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that counts the number of digit characters in a given string. The function should return the count of these digit characters.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and check if it is a digit. If it is, we increment a counter. At the end of the iteration, the counter will hold the total number of digit characters in the string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter to 0\n   For each character in the string:\n       If the character is a digit:\n           Increment the counter\n   Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef number_ctr(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of digits\n    digit_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is a digit\n        if char.isdigit():\n            # Increment the counter if it is a digit\n            digit_count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of digit characters\n    return digit_count\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the string, checks each character to see if it is a digit using the `isdigit()` method, and increments a counter accordingly. The final count is returned as the result.",
