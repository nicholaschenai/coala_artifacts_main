A digit character is any character from '0' to '9'.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Initialize a counter to zero. This counter will keep track of the number of digit characters in the string.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string.\n3. For each character, check if it is a digit.\n4. If the character is a digit, increment the counter by one.\n5.

The expression can include non-negative integers, the operators `+` and `-`, parentheses `(` and `)`, and spaces. The function should return the result of the expression as an integer. We cannot use Python's `eval` function.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach to handle the operations and parentheses. We will iterate through the string character by character. When we encounter a number, we will parse it and push it onto a stack. When we encounter an operator, we will apply it to the top numbers on the stack. Parentheses will be used to control the order of operations, and we will use a stack to manage them. Spaces will be ignored. The final result will be the value left on the stack after processing the entire string.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           Initialize a stack to store numbers and results\n           Initialize a variable to store the current number\n           Initialize a variable to store the current sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative)\n           Initialize a variable to store the result\n\n           Iterate over each character in the string:\n               If the character is a digit:\n                   Update the current number by appending the digit\n               If the character is a '+' or '-':\n                   Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result\n                   Update the sign based on the character\n                   Reset the current number to 0\n               If the character is '(':\n                   Push the current result and sign onto the stack\n                   Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression\n               If the character is ')':\n                   Add the current number multiplied by the current sign to the result\n                   Pop the sign and previous result from the stack and update the result\n                   Reset the current number to 0\n               Ignore spaces\n\n           After the loop, add the last number to the result\n           Return the result\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:\n                # Initialize a stack to store results and signs\n                stack = []\n                # Initialize the current number, result, and sign\n                current_number = 0\n                result = 0\n                sign = 1\n        \n                # Iterate over each character in the string\n                for char in s:\n                    if char.isdigit():\n                        # Build the current number\n                        current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)\n                    elif char == '+':\n                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign\n                        result += sign * current_number\n                        # Update the sign to positive\n                        sign = 1\n                        # Reset the current number\n                        current_number = 0\n                    elif char == '-':\n                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign\n                        result += sign * current_number\n                        # Update the sign to negative\n                        sign = -1\n                        # Reset the current number\n                        current_number = 0\n                    elif char == '(':\n                        # Push the current result and sign onto the stack\n                        stack.append(result)\n                        stack.append(sign)\n                        # Reset the result and sign for the new sub-expression\n                        result = 0\n                        sign = 1\n                    elif char == ')':\n                        # Add the current number to the result with the current sign\n                        result += sign * current_number\n                        # Pop the sign and previous result from the stack\n                        result *= stack.pop()  # this is the sign\n                        result += stack.pop()  # this is the previous result\n                        # Reset the current number\n                        current_number = 0\n        \n                # Add the last number to the result\n                result += sign * current_number\n                return result\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses a stack to manage the results and signs, processes each character in the string, and correctly handles parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['\"1 + 1\"'] Output: 2\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
