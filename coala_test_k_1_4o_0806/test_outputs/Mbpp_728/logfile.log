INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/728 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers as input. Each list has the same length. The function should return a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the two input lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over the indices of the input lists.
   - For each index, we will add the elements from both lists at that index.
   - We will store these sums in a new list.
   - Finally, we will return the new list containing all the sums.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function sum_list with parameters list1 and list2
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each index i from 0 to the length of list1 (or list2) - 1
           Add the elements at index i from both lists and append the sum to result
       Return the result list
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sum_list(list1, list2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sums
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the indices of the lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Add the elements at the current index from both lists
        # Append the sum to the result list
        result.append(list1[i] + list2[i])
    
    # Return the list containing the sums
    return result
```

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Prefix Sum Optimization**: My approach used a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. This is a common optimization technique for range sum queries, especially when the number of queries is large. The official solution, however, computes the sum directly for each query, which can be less efficient for larger inputs.

    2. **Handling Large Inputs**: The official solution uses a modulo operation with `1000000000` when computing the sum. This is likely intended to prevent integer overflow, although Python handles large integers natively. My solution did not include this, as it wasn't specified in the problem statement.

    3. **Function Structure**: My solution encapsulated the logic within a function and used `sys.stdin.read` for input handling, which is efficient for large inputs. The official solution uses a more straightforward approach with `input()` calls, which is simpler but can be less efficient for very large input sizes.

    4. **Code Readability and Maintenance**: My solution was structured with clear variable names and comments, making it easier to understand and maintain. The official solution is more concise but might be harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the problem.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of understanding the problem constraints and choosing the right optimization techniques. The prefix sum approach is particularly useful for problems involving multiple range queries, and ensuring efficient input/output handling is crucial for performance in competitive programming.
