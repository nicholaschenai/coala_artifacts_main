    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes two tuples of equal length as input and returns a new tuple. Each element in the new tuple is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from the two input tuples.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over the elements of the two input tuples simultaneously.\n   - For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will perform a bitwise AND operation.\n   - We will collect the results of these operations into a new tuple.\n   - Finally, we will return this new tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n       Initialize an empty list result\n       For each index i from 0 to length of tuple1:\n           Perform bitwise AND on tuple1[i] and tuple2[i]\n           Append the result to the list result\n       Convert the list result to a tuple\n       Return the tuple\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the bitwise AND operations\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Perform bitwise AND on the elements at the current index from both tuples\n        and_result = tuple1[i] & tuple2[i]\n        \n        # Append the result to the list\n        result.append(and_result)\n    \n    # Convert the list of results to a tuple\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThis function will take two tuples, perform element-wise bitwise AND operations, and return a new tuple with the results.",
