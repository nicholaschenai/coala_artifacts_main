INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/429 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function called `and_tuples` that takes two tuples of integers as input. The function should return a new tuple where each element is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples.

## Conceptual Solution

1. We will iterate over the elements of the two input tuples simultaneously.
2. For each pair of elements, we will perform a bitwise AND operation.
3. We will collect the results of these operations into a new tuple.
4. Finally, we will return the new tuple.

## Pseudocode

1. Define the function `and_tuples` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
2. Initialize an empty list `result`.
3. Loop over the elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2` using the `zip` function.
   - For each pair of elements `(a, b)`, compute `a & b` and append the result to `result`.
4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple.
5. Return the resulting tuple.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the bitwise AND operations
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously
    for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2):
        # Perform bitwise AND operation and append the result to the list
        result.append(a & b)
    
    # Convert the list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(result)

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept revolves around understanding the properties of the XOR operation and how it can be used to find a pair of integers \( (A, B) \) such that \( A \oplus B = N \). The challenge was to efficiently compute the function \( G(L, R) \) for multiple test cases, where \( G(L, R) \) is the sum of \( F(i) \) for all integers \( i \) from \( L \) to \( R \).

    The key insight was recognizing that for each \( N \), \( B \) can be computed as \( A \oplus N \), and the task is to find the smallest \( A \) such that \( 1 \le A \le B \le N \). This led to a straightforward approach of iterating over possible values of \( A \) and checking the conditions for \( B \).

    The solution involved writing a helper function `compute_F(N)` to find \( B \) for each \( N \), and another function `compute_G(L, R)` to sum these values over a range. The main function handled input/output efficiently, which is crucial given the constraints.

    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding bitwise operations and their properties, as well as the need for efficient input/output handling in competitive programming scenarios. The solution was straightforward once the properties of XOR were leveraged correctly, and no unexpected errors were encountered.

   We need to create a function that takes two tuples of equal length as input and returns a new tuple. Each element in the new tuple is the result of performing a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from the two input tuples.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over the elements of the two input tuples simultaneously.
   - For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will perform a bitwise AND operation.
   - We will collect the results of these operations into a new tuple.
   - Finally, we will return this new tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):
       Initialize an empty list result
       For each index i from 0 to length of tuple1:
           Perform bitwise AND on tuple1[i] and tuple2[i]
           Append the result to the list result
       Convert the list result to a tuple
       Return the tuple
   ```

```python
def and_tuples(tuple1, tuple2):

        # Append the result to the list
        result.append(and_result)
    
    # Convert the list of results to a tuple
    return tuple(result)
