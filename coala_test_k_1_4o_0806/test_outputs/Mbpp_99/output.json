    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation as a string. The binary string should not have any leading zeros.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To convert a decimal number to binary, we can repeatedly divide the number by 2 and keep track of the remainders. These remainders represent the binary digits (bits) of the number, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost). We collect these remainders and reverse them to form the binary string. If the number is zero, the binary representation should be \"0\".\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function decimal_to_binary(n):\n       If n is 0:\n           Return \"0\"\n       Initialize an empty string for binary representation\n       While n is greater than 0:\n           Append the remainder of n divided by 2 to the binary string\n           Update n to be the integer division of n by 2\n       Reverse the binary string\n       Return the binary string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    # Special case for zero\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to store binary digits\n    binary_str = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop until n becomes zero\n    while n > 0:\n        # Get the remainder of n divided by 2 (either 0 or 1)\n        remainder = n % 2\n        # Append the remainder to the binary string\n        binary_str = str(remainder) + binary_str\n        # Update n to be the integer division of n by 2\n        n = n // 2\n    \n    # Return the binary string\n    return binary_str\n```",
