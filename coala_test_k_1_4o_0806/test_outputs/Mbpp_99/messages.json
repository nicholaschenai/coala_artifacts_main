The binary string should not have any leading zeros.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Binary Conversion**: \n   - A decimal number can be converted to binary by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order (from last to first).\n\n2. **Steps to Convert Decimal to Binary**:\n   - Start with the given decimal number.\n   - Divide the number by 2.\n   - Record the remainder (0 or 1).\n   - Update the number to be the quotient of the division.\n   - Repeat the process until the number becomes zero.\n   - The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n3. **Edge Case**:\n   - If the input number is 0, the binary representation should be \"0\".\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction decimal_to_binary(n):\n    if n is 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    binary_string = \"\"\n    while n is greater than 0:\n        remainder = n % 2\n        binary_string = remainder + binary_string\n        n = n // 2\n    \n    return binary_string\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    # Handle the special case where the input is 0\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    # Initialize an empty string to build the binary representation\n    binary_string = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop until the number becomes zero\n    while n > 0:\n        # Get the remainder of the division by 2 (either 0 or 1)\n        remainder = n % 2\n        # Prepend the remainder to the binary string\n        binary_string = str(remainder) + binary_string\n        # Update the number to be the quotient of the division by 2\n        n = n // 2\n    \n    # Return the constructed binary string\n    return binary_string\n```\n\nThis code correctly converts a decimal number to its binary representation without leading zeros, handling the special case of zero appropriately."

The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\n    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.\n\n    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. \n\n    Here is the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            steps = 0\n            while n != 1:\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    n //= 2\n                else:\n                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                        n -= 1\n                    else:\n                        n += 1\n                steps += 1\n            return steps\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

These remainders represent the binary digits (bits) of the number, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost) to the most significant bit (leftmost).
