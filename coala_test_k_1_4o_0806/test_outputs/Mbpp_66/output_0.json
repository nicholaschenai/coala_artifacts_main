    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the count of numbers in the list that are greater than zero.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through each number in the list and check if it is positive (greater than zero). We will maintain a counter that increments each time we find a positive number. Finally, we will return the counter as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter to 0\n   For each number in the list:\n       If the number is greater than 0:\n           Increment the counter by 1\n   Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef pos_count(numbers):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of positive numbers\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the number is positive\n        if number > 0:\n            # Increment the counter if the number is positive\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of positive numbers\n    return count\n```",
