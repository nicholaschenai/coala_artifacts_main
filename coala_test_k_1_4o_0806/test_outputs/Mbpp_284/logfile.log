### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if all elements in a given list are equal to a specified element. The function should return `True` if all elements in the list match the specified element, and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input**: A list of elements and a single element to compare against.
2. **Output**: A boolean value (`True` or `False`).
3. **Approach**:
   - Iterate through each item in the list.
   - Compare each item with the specified element.
   - If any item does not match the specified element, return `False`.
   - If all items match, return `True`.

### Pseudocode

```
function check_element(lst, element):
    for each item in lst:
        if item is not equal to element:
            return False
    return True
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def check_element(lst, element):
    # Iterate through each item in the list
    for item in lst:
        # If the current item is not equal to the specified element
        if item != element:
            # Return False immediately
            return False
    # If all items are equal to the specified element, return True
    return True
```

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.
[/Summary]


INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/284 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that checks if every item in a given list is equal to a specified element. The function should return `True` if all items in the list are equal to the element, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each item in the list and compare it to the specified element. If we find any item that is not equal to the element, we immediately return `False`. If we finish checking all items and they are all equal to the element, we return `True`.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function check_element(lst, element):
       for each item in lst:
           if item is not equal to element:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def check_element(lst, element):
    # Iterate over each item in the list
    for item in lst:
        # If the current item is not equal to the specified element
        if item != element:
            # Return False immediately
            return False
    # If all items are equal to the element, return True
    return True
```

This function will correctly determine if all items in the list are equal to the given element by checking each item one by one. If any item is not equal, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all items.
