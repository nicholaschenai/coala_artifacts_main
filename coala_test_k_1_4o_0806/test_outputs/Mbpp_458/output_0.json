    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The function should return the area as an integer.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the area of a rectangle, we multiply its length by its width. The function will take two parameters: the length and the width of the rectangle. It will then return the product of these two numbers, which represents the area.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named rectangle_area with two parameters: length and width\n       Calculate the area by multiplying length and width\n       Return the calculated area\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\n# Define the function rectangle_area with parameters length and width\ndef rectangle_area(length: int, width: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the area by multiplying length and width\n    area = length * width\n    # Return the calculated area\n    return area\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the area of a rectangle when given its length and width as inputs.",
