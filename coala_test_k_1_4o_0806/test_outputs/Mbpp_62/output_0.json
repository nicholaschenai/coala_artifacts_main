    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest number from that list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the smallest number in a list, we can start by assuming the first number in the list is the smallest. Then, we iterate through the list, comparing each number to our current smallest number. If we find a number that is smaller, we update our smallest number. By the end of the list, we will have found the smallest number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function smallest_num(numbers):\n       if the list is empty:\n           return None (or handle the case as needed)\n       set smallest to the first element of the list\n       for each number in the list:\n           if the number is smaller than smallest:\n               update smallest to this number\n       return smallest\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef smallest_num(numbers):\n    # Check if the list is empty and return None if it is\n    if not numbers:\n        return None\n    \n    # Initialize the smallest number as the first element of the list\n    smallest = numbers[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # If the current number is smaller than the smallest found so far\n        if number < smallest:\n            # Update the smallest number\n            smallest = number\n    \n    # Return the smallest number found\n    return smallest\n```\n\nThis function will correctly find and return the smallest number in a given list of numbers. If the list is empty, it will return `None`.",
