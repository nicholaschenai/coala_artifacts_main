We will iterate through the list of numbers.\n2. We will keep track of the smallest number we have encountered so far.\n3. For each number in the list, we will compare it with the current smallest number.\n4. If the current number is smaller than the smallest number we have recorded, we will update our smallest number.\n5. After checking all numbers, we will return the smallest number found.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction smallest_num(numbers):\n    if the list is empty:\n        return None (or handle it as per requirement)\n    set smallest to the first element of the list\n    for each number in the list:\n        if number is less than smallest:\n            update smallest to be number\n    return smallest\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef smallest_num(numbers):\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        return None  # or raise an exception if empty lists are not allowed\n\n    # Initialize the smallest number with the first element of the list\n    smallest = numbers[0]\n\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # If the current number is smaller than the smallest recorded number\n        if number < smallest:\n            # Update the smallest number\n            smallest = number\n\n    # Return the smallest number found\n    return smallest\n```"

The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.\n\n    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.\n\n    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\n    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:\n    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.\n    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.\n    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"

Then, we iterate through the list, comparing each number to our current smallest number. If we find a number that is smaller, we update our smallest number. By the end of the list, we will have found the smallest number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function smallest_num(numbers):\n       if the list is empty:\n           return None (or handle the case as needed)\n       set smallest to the first element of the list\n       for each number in the list:\n           if the number is smaller than smallest:\n               update smallest to this number\n       return smallest\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef smallest_num(numbers):\n    # Check if the list is empty and return None if it is\n    if not numbers:\n        return None\n    \n    # Initialize the smallest number as the first element of the list\n    smallest = numbers[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # If the current number is smaller than the smallest found so far\n        if number < smallest:\n            # Update the smallest number\n            smallest = number\n    \n    # Return the smallest number found\n    return smallest\n```\n\nThis function will correctly find and return the smallest number in a given list of numbers. If the list is empty, it will return `None`."
