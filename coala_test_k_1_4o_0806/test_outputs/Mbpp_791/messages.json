The chef wants to remove all \"abc\" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove \"abc\" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.

We need to repeatedly remove any occurrence of the substring \"abc\" from the string until no such substring exists. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through each character of the string and use a stack to build the resulting string. Whenever we encounter the sequence \"abc\" in the stack, we will remove it. This process will be repeated until we have processed all characters in the string. The stack will help us efficiently manage the removal of \"abc\" sequences.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           For each test case:\n               Initialize an empty stack\n               For each character in the string:\n                   Push the character onto the stack\n                   If the top three characters in the stack form \"abc\":\n                       Pop the top three characters from the stack\n               Convert the stack to a string and output it\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        def remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases):\n            results = []\n            for string in test_cases:\n                stack = []\n                for char in string:\n                    stack.append(char)\n                    # Check if the last three characters in the stack form \"abc\"\n                    if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:\n                        # Remove the \"abc\" from the stack\n                        stack.pop()\n                        stack.pop()\n                        stack.pop()\n                # Convert the stack back to a string\n                results.append(''.join(stack))\n            return results\n\n        # Read input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        # First line is the number of test cases\n        T = int(data[0])\n        test_cases = data[1:T+1]\n\n        # Get the results\n        results = remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases)\n\n        # Print the results\n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses a stack to efficiently manage the removal of \"abc\" sequences from the string. By checking the top three elements of the stack, we can determine when to remove the sequence and continue processing the rest of the string.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['2', 'aabcc', 'bababccc'] Output: ac\n        bc\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
