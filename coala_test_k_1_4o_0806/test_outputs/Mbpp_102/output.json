    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that converts a string from snake_case to CamelCase. In snake_case, words are separated by underscores, and in CamelCase, each word starts with a capital letter and there are no underscores.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To convert a snake_case string to CamelCase:\n   - Split the string into words using the underscore as a delimiter.\n   - Capitalize the first letter of each word.\n   - Join all the capitalized words together without any spaces or underscores.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function snake_to_camel(snake_str):\n       Split the snake_str into words using '_' as the delimiter\n       Capitalize the first letter of each word\n       Join all the capitalized words into a single string\n       Return the resulting CamelCase string\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef snake_to_camel(snake_str: str) -> str:\n    # Split the input string by underscores to get individual words\n    words = snake_str.split('_')\n    # Capitalize the first letter of each word and join them together\n    camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)\n    # Return the resulting CamelCase string\n    return camel_case_str\n```\n\nThis function takes a snake_case string, splits it into words, capitalizes each word, and then joins them to form a CamelCase string.",
