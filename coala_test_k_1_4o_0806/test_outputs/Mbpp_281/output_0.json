    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if all elements in a given list are unique. If all elements are unique, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if all elements in a list are unique, we can use a set. A set is a data structure that automatically handles duplicates, meaning it only stores unique elements. By converting the list to a set, we can compare the length of the set with the length of the list. If the lengths are the same, it means all elements were unique; otherwise, there were duplicates.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function all_unique(lst):\n       Convert the list to a set\n       Compare the length of the set with the length of the list\n       If lengths are equal, return True\n       Otherwise, return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef all_unique(lst):\n    # Convert the list to a set, which will remove any duplicate elements\n    unique_elements = set(lst)\n    \n    # Compare the length of the set with the length of the list\n    # If they are equal, it means all elements in the list were unique\n    return len(unique_elements) == len(lst)\n```\n\nThis function uses the properties of a set to efficiently determine if all elements in the list are unique. If the set's length matches the list's length, it confirms that there were no duplicates in the list.",
