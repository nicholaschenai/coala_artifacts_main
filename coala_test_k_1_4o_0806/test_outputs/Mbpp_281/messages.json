        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that checks if all elements in a given list are unique. If all elements are unique, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\nTo determine if all elements in a list are unique, we can use the properties of a set. A set is a collection that automatically removes duplicate elements. Therefore, if we convert the list to a set and the length of the set is the same as the length of the list, then all elements in the list are unique. If the lengths differ, it means there were duplicates in the list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `all_unique` that takes a list `lst` as an argument.\n2. Convert the list `lst` to a set, which will remove any duplicate elements.\n3. Compare the length of the set with the length of the list.\n4. If the lengths are equal, return `True` (indicating all elements are unique).\n5. If the lengths are not equal, return `False` (indicating there are duplicates).\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef all_unique(lst):\n    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates\n    unique_elements = set(lst)\n    \n    # Compare the length of the set with the length of the list\n    # If they are equal, all elements were unique\n    return len(unique_elements) == len(lst)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently checks for uniqueness by leveraging the properties of a set, ensuring that the function runs in linear time relative to the size of the list."

The core concept here is understanding how the bitwise OR operation works and how it can be efficiently computed over subarrays.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Bitwise OR Properties**: The OR operation is cumulative in the sense that adding more elements to a subarray can only maintain or increase the OR result.\n    - **Set for Uniqueness**: Using a set to track results ensures that duplicates are automatically handled, which is crucial for counting unique results.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - **Dynamic Approach**: Instead of recalculating the OR for every possible subarray, maintain a set of results from the previous iteration (`prev`). For each new element, compute the OR with each element in `prev` and add the new element itself. This reduces redundant calculations.\n    - **Iterative Update**: For each element in the array, update the `prev` set with new OR results and add these to a global `results` set to track all unique OR results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    from typing import List\n\n    class Solution:\n        def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n            results = set()\n            prev = set()\n        \n            for x in A:\n                current = {x}\n                for y in prev:\n                    current.add(x | y)\n                prev = current\n                results.update(current)\n        \n            return len(results)\n    ```\n\n    This approach efficiently computes the number of unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to manage unique results. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

If the set's length matches the list's length, it confirms that there were no duplicates in the list."
