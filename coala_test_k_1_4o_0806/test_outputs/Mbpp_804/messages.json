If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding Even Product**: A product of numbers is even if at least one of the numbers in the list is even. This is because multiplying any number by an even number results in an even product.\n\n2. **Approach**: \n   - Iterate through each number in the list.\n   - Check if any number is even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder).\n   - If an even number is found, return `True` immediately.\n   - If the loop completes without finding an even number, return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction is_product_even(numbers):\n    for each number in numbers:\n        if number is even:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_product_even(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If an even number is found, the product is even\n            return True\n    # If no even number is found, the product is not even\n    return False\n```"

The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.\n    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.\n    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countDivisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        i = 1\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n            i += 1\n        return count\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            A = int(data[index])\n            B = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            diff = abs(A - B)\n        \n            if diff == 0:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                results.append(countDivisors(diff))\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if the product of numbers in a list is even, we don't need to calculate the entire product. Instead, we can simply check if any number in the list is even. If at least one number is even, the product will be even. If all numbers are odd, the product will be odd. Therefore, the solution involves iterating through the list and checking for the presence of an even number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function is_product_even(numbers):\n       For each number in numbers:\n           If number is even (number % 2 == 0):\n               Return True\n       Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_product_even(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If an even number is found, the product is even\n            return True\n    # If no even number is found, the product is odd\n    return False\n```"
