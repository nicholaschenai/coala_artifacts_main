    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if the product of all numbers in a given list is even. If the product is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if the product of numbers in a list is even, we don't need to calculate the entire product. Instead, we can simply check if any number in the list is even. If at least one number is even, the product will be even. If all numbers are odd, the product will be odd. Therefore, the solution involves iterating through the list and checking for the presence of an even number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function is_product_even(numbers):\n       For each number in numbers:\n           If number is even (number % 2 == 0):\n               Return True\n       Return False\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_product_even(numbers):\n    # Iterate through each number in the list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Check if the current number is even\n        if number % 2 == 0:\n            # If an even number is found, the product is even\n            return True\n    # If no even number is found, the product is odd\n    return False\n```",
