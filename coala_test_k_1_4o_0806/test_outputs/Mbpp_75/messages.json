The function should return a list of tuples where every element in each tuple is divisible by `k`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.\n   - For each tuple, we will check if all of its elements are divisible by `k`.\n   - If a tuple meets this condition, we will include it in the result list.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of tuples that satisfy the condition.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function find_tuples with parameters: list_of_tuples, k\n       Initialize an empty list called result\n       For each tuple in list_of_tuples\n           Check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by k\n           If true, append the tuple to result\n       Return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_tuples(list_of_tuples, k):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list\n    for tup in list_of_tuples:\n        # Check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by k\n        if all(element % k == 0 for element in tup):\n            # If true, append the tuple to the result list\n            result.append(tup)\n    \n    # Return the list of tuples that satisfy the condition\n    return result\n```\n\nThis code defines the function `find_tuples` which iterates over each tuple in the input list, checks if all elements in the tuple are divisible by `k`, and collects those tuples in a result list which is returned at the end."

For each query, we need to determine the number of subsets in which the Ith number appears at the Kth position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number I to be at the Kth position in a subset, there must be exactly \\(K-1\\) numbers smaller than I in the subset. This means we need to choose \\(K-1\\) numbers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, I-1\\}\\).\n\n        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose \\(K-1\\) numbers from \\(I-1\\) numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{I-1}{K-1}\\).\n\n        3. **Remaining Elements**: After placing I at the Kth position, the remaining elements of the subset can be any subset of the numbers greater than I, i.e., from the set \\(\\{I+1, I+2, \\ldots, N\\}\\). There are \\(2^{N-I}\\) such subsets.\n\n        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we can precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible N.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        1. Precompute factorials and their inverses modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) up to the maximum N.\n        2. For each test case:\n           - For each query (I, K):\n             - If \\(K > I\\), output 0 (impossible to have I at Kth position).\n             - Otherwise, compute the number of subsets using the formula:\n               \\[\n               \\text{result} = \\binom{I-1}{K-1} \\times 2^{N-I} \\mod (10^9 + 7)\n               \\]\n        3.
