    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. The function should return a list of tuples where all elements in each tuple are divisible by `k`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Iterate through the list of tuples**: For each tuple in the list, we need to check if all elements are divisible by `k`.\n2. **Check divisibility**: For each element in a tuple, check if it is divisible by `k`. If all elements in the tuple are divisible by `k`, include the tuple in the result list.\n3. **Return the result**: After checking all tuples, return the list of tuples that meet the criteria.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store tuples that meet the criteria.\n2. For each tuple `t` in the input list:\n   - Check if all elements in `t` are divisible by `k`.\n   - If true, append `t` to `result`.\n3. Return `result`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_tuples(tuples_list, k):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for t in tuples_list:\n        # Check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by k\n        if all(element % k == 0 for element in t):\n            # If true, append the tuple to the result list\n            result.append(t)\n    \n    # Return the list of tuples that meet the criteria\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through each tuple in the list and checks if all elements are divisible by `k`. If they are, the tuple is added to the result list, which is returned at the end.",
