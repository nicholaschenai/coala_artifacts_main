INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/75 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. The function should return a list of tuples where every element in each tuple is divisible by `k`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, we will check if all of its elements are divisible by `k`.
   - If a tuple meets this condition, we will include it in the result list.
   - Finally, we will return the list of tuples that satisfy the condition.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function find_tuples with parameters: list_of_tuples, k
       Initialize an empty list called result
       For each tuple in list_of_tuples
           Check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by k
           If true, append the tuple to result
       Return result
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_tuples(list_of_tuples, k):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the input list
    for tup in list_of_tuples:
        # Check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by k
        if all(element % k == 0 for element in tup):
            # If true, append the tuple to the result list
            result.append(tup)
    
    # Return the list of tuples that satisfy the condition
    return result
```

This code defines the function `find_tuples` which iterates over each tuple in the input list, checks if all elements in the tuple are divisible by `k`, and collects those tuples in a result list which is returned at the end.

        number of set come at Kth postion.Elements of every subset should be in sorted order.
        The answer could  be very large so you have to print answer modulo 1e9+7.


        -----Input:-----
        - The first line of input cotains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
        - For every test case it contains two number N and Q.
        - Next Q line contains two number I and K.

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case print required answer.

        -----Constraints and Subtasks:-----
        - 1<=T<=5
        - 1<=N, K<=4000
        - 1<=Q<=1000000
        Subtask 3: 5 points

        Input:

        1

        3 3

        1 2

        2 1

        3 2

        Output:

        0

        2

        2

        -----Explanation:-----
        For N=3

        total subsets are:

        {1}

        {2}

        {3}

        {1,2}

        {1,3}

        {2,3}

        {1,2,3}

        Now we can see that for I=1 and K=2 there is no subset in which 1 come at 2nd position so the answer is Zero for that query.

        For 2nd query I=2 and K=1 there are two subset i.e {2,3} and {2} in which 2 come at 1st position.

        Same for 3rd querry there is two subset i.e{1,3} and {2,3}.

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given a set of natural numbers from 1 to N and a number of queries Q. For each query, we need to determine the number of subsets in which the Ith number appears at the Kth position when the subset is sorted. The result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Subsets**: For a number I to be at the Kth position in a subset, there must be exactly \(K-1\) numbers smaller than I in the subset. This means we need to choose \(K-1\) numbers from the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, I-1\}\).

        2. **Combinatorial Counting**: The number of ways to choose \(K-1\) numbers from \(I-1\) numbers is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{I-1}{K-1}\).

        3. **Remaining Elements**: After placing I at the Kth position, the remaining elements of the subset can be any subset of the numbers greater than I, i.e., from the set \(\{I+1, I+2, \ldots, N\}\). There are \(2^{N-I}\) such subsets.

        4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be large, we need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

        5. **Precomputation**: To efficiently compute binomial coefficients and powers of 2, we can precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible N.

        ## Pseudocode

        1. Precompute factorials and their inverses modulo \(10^9 + 7\) up to the maximum N.
        2. For each test case:
           - For each query (I, K):
             - If \(K > I\), output 0 (impossible to have I at Kth position).
             - Otherwise, compute the number of subsets using the formula:
               \[
               \text{result} = \binom{I-1}{K-1} \times 2^{N-I} \mod (10^9 + 7)
               \]
        3. Output the result for each query.

        ## Final Python Solution

        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        def precompute_factorials_and_inverses(max_n):
            factorial = [1] * (max_n + 1)

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/75 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples and an integer `k`. The function should return a list of tuples where all elements in each tuple are divisible by `k`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Iterate through the list of tuples**: For each tuple in the list, we need to check if all elements are divisible by `k`.
2. **Check divisibility**: For each element in a tuple, check if it is divisible by `k`. If all elements in the tuple are divisible by `k`, include the tuple in the result list.
3. **Return the result**: After checking all tuples, return the list of tuples that meet the criteria.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store tuples that meet the criteria.
2. For each tuple `t` in the input list:
   - Check if all elements in `t` are divisible by `k`.
   - If true, append `t` to `result`.
3. Return `result`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_tuples(tuples_list, k):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for t in tuples_list:

            result.append(t)
    
    # Return the list of tuples that meet the criteria
