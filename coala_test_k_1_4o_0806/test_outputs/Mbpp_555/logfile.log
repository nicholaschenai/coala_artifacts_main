INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/555 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the difference between two sums for the first `n` natural numbers:
1. The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.
2. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Sum of Cubes**: For the first `n` natural numbers, calculate the sum of their cubes. This means for numbers 1 through `n`, compute \(1^3 + 2^3 + \ldots + n^3\).

2. **Sum of Natural Numbers**: Calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is \(1 + 2 + \ldots + n\).

3. **Difference**: Subtract the sum of the natural numbers from the sum of their cubes.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize `sum_of_cubes` to 0.
2. Initialize `sum_of_numbers` to 0.
3. Loop through each number `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive):
   - Add `i^3` to `sum_of_cubes`.
   - Add `i` to `sum_of_numbers`.
4. Calculate the difference as `sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers`.
5. Return the difference.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def difference(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize sums
    sum_of_cubes = 0
    sum_of_numbers = 0
    
    # Calculate the sums
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3
        sum_of_numbers += i
    
    # Calculate the difference
    diff = sum_of_cubes - sum_of_numbers
    
    # Return the result
    return diff
```

This function will correctly compute the difference between the sum of cubes and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:

    1. **Formula Derivation**:
       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.

    2. **Handling the First Term**:
       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.

    3. **Efficiency**:
       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.

    4. **Code Simplicity**:
       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.

    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.

We need to write a function that calculates the difference between two sums for the first `n` natural numbers:
1. The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.
2. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Sum of the first `n` natural numbers**: This can be calculated using the formula \( S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
2. **Sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers**: This can be calculated using the formula \( S_{\text{cubes}} = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2 \). This is because the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
3. **Difference**: Subtract the sum of the first `n` natural numbers from the sum of their cubes.

## Pseudocode

```
function difference(n):
    sum_n = n * (n + 1) / 2
    sum_cubes = sum_n * sum_n
    difference = sum_cubes - sum_n
    return difference
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def difference(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers
    sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2
    
    # Calculate the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers
    sum_cubes = sum_n * sum_n
    
    # Calculate the difference
    difference = sum_cubes - sum_n
    
    return difference
```

This solution uses integer arithmetic to ensure that the calculations are efficient and accurate for integer inputs. The use of `//` ensures that the division results in an integer, which is appropriate for this problem.
