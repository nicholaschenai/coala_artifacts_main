    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the difference between two sums for the first `n` natural numbers:\n1. The sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.\n2. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Sum of the first `n` natural numbers**: This can be calculated using the formula \\( S = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\).\n2. **Sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers**: This can be calculated using the formula \\( S_{\\text{cubes}} = \\left(\\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\\right)^2 \\). This is because the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers is the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.\n3. **Difference**: Subtract the sum of the first `n` natural numbers from the sum of their cubes.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction difference(n):\n    sum_n = n * (n + 1) / 2\n    sum_cubes = sum_n * sum_n\n    difference = sum_cubes - sum_n\n    return difference\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef difference(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers\n    sum_n = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers\n    sum_cubes = sum_n * sum_n\n    \n    # Calculate the difference\n    difference = sum_cubes - sum_n\n    \n    return difference\n```\n\nThis solution uses integer arithmetic to ensure that the calculations are efficient and accurate for integer inputs. The use of `//` ensures that the division results in an integer, which is appropriate for this problem.",
