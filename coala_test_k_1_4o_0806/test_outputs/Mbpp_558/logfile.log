INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/558 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding digits of two integers. For example, if the two integers are 123 and 456, we would calculate the absolute difference between 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6, and then sum these differences.

### Conceptual Solution

1. Convert both integers to strings so that we can easily access each digit.
2. Determine the length of the longer number to ensure we compare all digits.
3. Pad the shorter number with leading zeros to match the length of the longer number.
4. Iterate over the digits of both numbers simultaneously.
5. For each pair of digits, calculate the absolute difference and add it to a running total.
6. Return the total sum of these differences.

### Pseudocode

```
function digit_distance_nums(a, b):
    convert a and b to strings
    determine the maximum length of the two strings
    pad the shorter string with leading zeros
    initialize a variable total_difference to 0
    for each pair of digits in the strings:
        calculate the absolute difference
        add the difference to total_difference
    return total_difference
```

### Python Code

```python
def digit_distance_nums(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # Convert both numbers to strings
    str_a = str(a)
    str_b = str(b)
    
    # Determine the maximum length of the two numbers
    max_length = max(len(str_a), len(str_b))
    
    # Pad the shorter number with leading zeros
    str_a = str_a.zfill(max_length)
    str_b = str_b.zfill(max_length)
    
    # Initialize the total difference
    total_difference = 0
    
    # Iterate over the digits of both numbers
    for digit_a, digit_b in zip(str_a, str_b):
        # Calculate the absolute difference and add to the total
        total_difference += abs(int(digit_a) - int(digit_b))
    
    # Return the total difference
    return total_difference
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I tackled the challenge of finding the longest arithmetic subsequence in a list of integers. The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is used to efficiently track and extend subsequences based on their differences. The key insight was to use a dictionary to store the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index with a specific difference. This allowed for quick updates and retrievals, making the solution efficient even for larger input sizes.

    The strategy involved iterating over each pair of indices `(i, j)` with `i < j`, calculating the difference `diff = A[j] - A[i]`, and updating the dictionary to reflect the longest subsequence ending at `j` with that difference. If a subsequence with the same difference already existed ending at `i`, it was extended; otherwise, a new subsequence was started.

    This approach worked well, and the solution passed all test cases. The use of a dictionary to map tuples of indices and differences to subsequence lengths was crucial in achieving an efficient solution. This problem reinforced the utility of dynamic programming in solving sequence-related problems and the importance of choosing the right data structures to manage state efficiently. 

    Here's the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def longestArithSeqLength(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
            dp = {}
            for j in range(1, len(A)):
                for i in range(j):
                    diff = A[j] - A[i]
                    if (i, diff) in dp:
                        dp[(j, diff)] = dp[(i, diff)] + 1
                    else:
                        dp[(j, diff)] = 2
            return max(dp.values())
    ```

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/558 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to create a function that calculates the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding digits of two integers. For example, if the two integers are 123 and 456, we compare each digit: |1-4|, |2-5|, and |3-6|, and then sum these differences.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   - Convert both integers to strings to easily access each digit.
   - Determine the length of the longer number to ensure we compare all digits.
   - For each digit position, calculate the absolute difference between the digits of the two numbers.
   - If one number is shorter, assume its missing digits are zero.
   - Sum all the absolute differences to get the final result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   function digit_distance_nums(a, b):
       convert a and b to strings
       determine the maximum length of the two strings
       initialize sum_difference to 0
       for each index from 0 to max length - 1:
           if index is within the length of a, get digit_a, else digit_a is 0
           if index is within the length of b, get digit_b, else digit_b is 0
