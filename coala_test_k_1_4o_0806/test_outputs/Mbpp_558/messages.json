For example, if the two integers are 123 and 456, we would calculate the absolute difference between 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6, and then sum these differences.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Convert both integers to strings so that we can easily access each digit.\n2. Determine the length of the longer number to ensure we compare all digits.\n3. Pad the shorter number with leading zeros to match the length of the longer number.\n4. Iterate over the digits of both numbers simultaneously.\n5.

The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is used to efficiently track and extend subsequences based on their differences. The key insight was to use a dictionary to store the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index with a specific difference. This allowed for quick updates and retrievals, making the solution efficient even for larger input sizes.\n\n    The strategy involved iterating over each pair of indices `(i, j)` with `i < j`, calculating the difference `diff = A[j] - A[i]`, and updating the dictionary to reflect the longest subsequence ending at `j` with that difference. If a subsequence with the same difference already existed ending at `i`, it was extended; otherwise, a new subsequence was started.\n\n    This approach worked well, and the solution passed all test cases. The use of a dictionary to map tuples of indices and differences to subsequence lengths was crucial in achieving an efficient solution. This problem reinforced the utility of dynamic programming in solving sequence-related problems and the importance of choosing the right data structures to manage state efficiently. \n\n    Here's the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def longestArithSeqLength(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n            dp = {}\n            for j in range(1, len(A)):\n                for i in range(j):\n                    diff = A[j] - A[i]\n                    if (i, diff) in dp:\n                        dp[(j, diff)] = dp[(i, diff)] + 1\n                    else:\n                        dp[(j, diff)] = 2\n            return max(dp.values())\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
