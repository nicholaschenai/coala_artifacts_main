    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a list of strings as input. Each string contains multiple words separated by spaces. The function should return a tuple containing the first two words that start with the letter 'p' (case-sensitive) from the entire list of strings.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Iterate over each string in the list.\n2. For each string, split it into individual words.\n3. Check each word to see if it starts with the letter 'p'.\n4. Collect the first two words that start with 'p'.\n5. Return these two words as a tuple.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store words starting with 'p'.\n2. For each string in the input list:\n   - Split the string into words.\n   - For each word:\n     - If the word starts with 'p':\n       - Add the word to `result`.\n       - If the length of `result` is 2, break out of the loop.\n3. Return the first two elements of `result` as a tuple.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef start_withp(words_list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store words starting with 'p'\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each string in the list\n    for sentence in words_list:\n        # Split the string into individual words\n        words = sentence.split()\n        \n        # Check each word\n        for word in words:\n            # If the word starts with 'p', add it to the result list\n            if word.startswith('p'):\n                result.append(word)\n                # If we have found two words, return them as a tuple\n                if len(result) == 2:\n                    return (result[0], result[1])\n    \n    # If less than two words are found, return the available ones\n    return tuple(result)\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through each word in the list of strings, checks if it starts with 'p', and collects the first two such words. It then returns these words as a tuple.",
