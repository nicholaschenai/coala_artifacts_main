INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/287 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify Even Numbers**: The even natural numbers start from 2 and increase by 2 for each subsequent even number. So, the first `n` even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.
   
2. **Square Each Even Number**: For each of these even numbers, calculate its square.

3. **Sum the Squares**: Add up all the squared values to get the final result.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a variable `sum_of_squares` to 0 to keep track of the sum.
2. Loop over a range from 1 to `n` (inclusive):
   - For each `i` in this range, calculate the `i`-th even number as `2 * i`.
   - Square this even number.
   - Add the squared value to `sum_of_squares`.
3. Return `sum_of_squares`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def square_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum of squares to 0
    sum_of_squares = 0
    
    # Loop over the first n even numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the i-th even number
        even_number = 2 * i
        # Add the square of the even number to the sum
        sum_of_squares += even_number ** 2
    
    # Return the total sum of squares
    return sum_of_squares
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.

    ### Strategy:
    - I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.
    - This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).

    ### Implementation:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.
