    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of the squares of the first `n` even natural numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to:\n   - Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. These numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n.\n   - Calculate the square of each of these numbers.\n   - Sum up all these squared values.\n   - Return the resulting sum.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function square_Sum(n):\n       Initialize sum_of_squares to 0\n       For i from 1 to n:\n           Calculate the i-th even number as 2 * i\n           Square this even number\n           Add the squared value to sum_of_squares\n       Return sum_of_squares\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef square_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum of squares to 0\n    sum_of_squares = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n even numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th even number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Add the square of the even number to the sum\n        sum_of_squares += even_number ** 2\n    \n    # Return the total sum of squares\n    return sum_of_squares\n```",
