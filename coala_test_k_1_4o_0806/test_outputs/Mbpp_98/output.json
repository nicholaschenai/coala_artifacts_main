    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers, multiplies all the numbers together, and then divides the result by the number of elements in the list. The function should return this final value.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to multiply all the numbers in the list together. We can start with a product of 1 and multiply each number in the list with this product.\n   - Next, we need to find the length of the list, which is the number of elements in it.\n   - Finally, we divide the product of the numbers by the length of the list to get the desired result.\n   - Return the result of this division.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function multiply_num(numbers):\n       initialize product as 1\n       for each number in numbers:\n           multiply product by number\n       length_of_list = length of numbers\n       result = product divided by length_of_list\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef multiply_num(numbers):\n    # Initialize the product to 1\n    product = 1\n    \n    # Multiply each number in the list to the product\n    for number in numbers:\n        product *= number\n    \n    # Calculate the length of the list\n    length_of_list = len(numbers)\n    \n    # Divide the product by the length of the list to get the result\n    result = product / length_of_list\n    \n    # Return the result\n    return result\n```",
