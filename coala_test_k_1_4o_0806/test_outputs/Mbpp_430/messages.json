The function should take three parameters \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), and return the y-coordinate of the directrix.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the Parabola Equation**: The standard form of a parabola is \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\). The vertex form is \\( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \\), where \\( (h, k) \\) is the vertex of the parabola.\n\n2. **Vertex Calculation**: The x-coordinate of the vertex \\( h \\) can be found using the formula \\( h = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n\n3. **Directrix Calculation**: The directrix of a parabola is a horizontal line. For a parabola that opens upwards or downwards, the directrix is given by the formula \\( y = k - \\frac{1}{4a} \\), where \\( k \\) is the y-coordinate of the vertex.\n\n4. **Find the y-coordinate of the Vertex**: Substitute \\( h \\) back into the original equation to find \\( k \\): \\( k = a(h)^2 + b(h) + c \\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Directrix**: Use the formula for the directrix to find its y-coordinate.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Calculate \\( h = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\).\n2. Calculate \\( k = a(h)^2 + b(h) + c \\).\n3. Calculate the directrix as \\( y = k - \\frac{1}{4a} \\).\n4. Return the y-coordinate of the directrix.\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\ndef parabola_directrix(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Step 1: Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex\n    h = -b / (2 * a)\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the y-coordinate of the vertex\n    k = a * h**2 + b * h + c\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the y-coordinate of the directrix\n    directrix = k - 1 / (4 * a)\n    \n    # Return the directrix as an integer\n    return int(directrix)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the directrix of a parabola given its coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) by first finding the vertex and then using the vertex to determine the directrix. The result is returned as an integer."

The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) given these constraints.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \\( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \\).\n    - **Area Formula**: The area \\( S \\) is given by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b = S \\).\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \\( b = \\frac{2S}{a} \\) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \\( a \\).\n    - **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.\n    - **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.\n    - **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.\n    - **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    import math\n\n    def find_triangle_sides():\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            H = int(data[index])\n            S = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            if 2 * S > H * H:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n                continue\n        \n            try:\n                discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S\n                if discriminant < 0:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                    continue\n            \n                a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n                a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n            \n                b1 = 2 * S / a1\n                b2 = 2 * S / a2\n            \n                if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n            except ValueError:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n    \n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    find_triangle_sides()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation and precision handling in computational geometry problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

Upon reviewing the problem, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the formula used for calculating the directrix. The directrix of a parabola in the form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) is calculated using the properties of the parabola's vertex and focus.\n\nFor a parabola \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), the vertex form is \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\( h = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\) and \\( k = c - \\frac{b^2}{4a} \\). The directrix is given by:\n\n\\[\ny = k - \\frac{1}{4a}\n\\]\n\nLet's implement the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef parabola_directrix(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the vertex's y-coordinate (k)\n    k = c - (b**2 / (4 * a))\n    \n    # Calculate the directrix using the formula: y = k - (1 / (4 * a))\n    directrix = k - (1 / (4 * a))\n    \n    # Return the directrix as an integer\n    return int(directrix)\n```\n\nThis function should now correctly calculate the directrix of the parabola using the correct formula."
