    "raw_msg": "Let's revisit the problem and correct the solution based on the insights and the correct formula for the directrix of a parabola. \n\nUpon reviewing the problem, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the formula used for calculating the directrix. The directrix of a parabola in the form \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) is not directly calculated using the formula I previously provided. Instead, the directrix is a line parallel to the x-axis, and its position is determined by the vertex and the focus of the parabola.\n\nFor a parabola \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\), the vertex form is \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\), where \\( h = -\\frac{b}{2a} \\) and \\( k = c - \\frac{b^2}{4a} \\). The directrix is given by:\n\n\\[\ny = k - \\frac{1}{4a}\n\\]\n\nLet's implement the corrected solution:\n\n```python\ndef parabola_directrix(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the vertex's y-coordinate (k)\n    k = c - (b**2 / (4 * a))\n    \n    # Calculate the directrix using the formula: y = k - (1 / (4 * a))\n    directrix = k - (1 / (4 * a))\n    \n    # Return the directrix as an integer\n    return int(directrix)\n```\n\nThis function should now correctly calculate the directrix of the parabola using the correct formula.",
