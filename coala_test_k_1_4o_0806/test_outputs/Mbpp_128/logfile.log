INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/128 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes an integer `n` and a string of words. The function should return a list of words from the string that have more than `n` characters.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Split the input string into individual words.
   - Iterate over each word and check its length.
   - If a word's length is greater than `n`, add it to a result list.
   - Return the list of words that are longer than `n` characters.

3. **Pseudocode:**
   ```
   function long_words(n, sentence):
       split the sentence into a list of words
       initialize an empty list called result
       for each word in the list of words:
           if the length of the word is greater than n:
               append the word to the result list
       return the result list
   ```

4. **Final Python 3 Solution:**

```python
def long_words(n: int, sentence: str) -> list:
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()
    # Initialize an empty list to store words longer than n
    result = []
    # Iterate over each word in the list
    for word in words:
        # Check if the word's length is greater than n
        if len(word) > n:
            # Add the word to the result list
            result.append(word)
    # Return the list of words longer than n
    return result
```

This solution follows the steps outlined in the pseudocode and adheres to the problem requirements. It splits the input sentence into words, checks each word's length, and collects those that are longer than `n` into a list, which is then returned.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to transform a positive integer `n` into `1` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.

    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.

    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. 

    Here is the final solution for reference:

    ```python
    class Solution:
        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
            steps = 0
            while n != 1:
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    n //= 2
                else:
                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                        n -= 1
                    else:
                        n += 1
                steps += 1
            return steps
    ```
