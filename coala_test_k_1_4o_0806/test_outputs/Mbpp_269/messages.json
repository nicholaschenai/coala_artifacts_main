The ASCII value is a numerical representation of a character in the ASCII table.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. The input to the function will be a single character string.\n2. We need to find the ASCII value of this character.\n3. In Python, the built-in function `ord()` can be used to get the ASCII value of a character.\n4. The function will return the result of `ord()` applied to the input character.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction ascii_value(character):\n    return ord(character)\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef ascii_value(character: str) -> int:\n    # Use the built-in ord() function to get the ASCII value of the character\n    return ord(character)\n```"

Both solutions utilized a stack to handle parentheses and maintain the correct order of operations, and both iterated through the string character by character to build numbers and apply operations.\n\n    Key insights from the official solution:\n    - The use of `ord(c) - ord('0')` to convert a character to its integer value is a neat trick that avoids using `int(c)`. This is a minor optimization but can be useful in environments where performance is critical.\n    - The official solution resets the `sign` to `1` after processing a closing parenthesis, which is a good practice to ensure that the sign is correctly initialized for any subsequent operations.\n    - The final check `if num:` before adding the last number to the result ensures that any remaining number is added to the result, which is a good safeguard against missing the last number in the expression.\n\n    Overall, the problem was a good exercise in using stacks to manage nested operations and ensuring that all parts of the expression are evaluated correctly. The official solution confirmed the effectiveness of the stack-based approach and provided a few minor optimizations that could be useful in similar problems.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
