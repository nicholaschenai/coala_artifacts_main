INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/420 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we need to find the sum of the cubes of the first two even numbers, which are 2 and 4.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. Even natural numbers start from 2 and increase by 2 (i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...).
2. For each of these even numbers, calculate its cube.
3. Sum up all these cubes to get the final result.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize a variable `sum_cubes` to 0 to store the sum of cubes.
2. Loop over the first `n` even natural numbers:
   - For each even number `i`, calculate its cube (`i**3`).
   - Add this cube to `sum_cubes`.
3. Return `sum_cubes`.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def cube_Sum(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the sum of cubes to 0
    sum_cubes = 0
    
    # Loop over the first n even natural numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the i-th even number
        even_number = 2 * i
        # Add the cube of the even number to the sum
        sum_cubes += even_number ** 3
    
    # Return the total sum of cubes
    return sum_cubes
```

This function calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers by iterating through the first `n` even numbers, cubing each, and accumulating the result.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:

    1. **Formula Derivation**:
       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.

    2. **Handling the First Term**:
       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.

    3. **Efficiency**:
       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.

    4. **Code Simplicity**:
       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.

    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.
