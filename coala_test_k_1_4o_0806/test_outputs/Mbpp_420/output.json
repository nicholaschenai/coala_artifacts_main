    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we need to find the sum of the cubes of the first two even numbers, which are 2 and 4.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Identify the first `n` even natural numbers. These numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to `2n`.\n   - Calculate the cube of each of these numbers.\n   - Sum all these cubes to get the final result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function cube_Sum(n):\n       Initialize sum to 0\n       For i from 1 to n:\n           Calculate the i-th even number as 2 * i\n           Calculate the cube of this even number\n           Add the cube to sum\n       Return sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef cube_Sum(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the sum to 0\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Loop through the first n even natural numbers\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the i-th even number\n        even_number = 2 * i\n        # Calculate the cube of the even number\n        cube = even_number ** 3\n        # Add the cube to the total sum\n        total_sum += cube\n    \n    # Return the total sum of cubes\n    return total_sum\n```",
