INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/618 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to create a function that takes two lists of numbers as input and returns a new list. This new list should contain the result of dividing each element of the first list by the corresponding element of the second list. The division should be done element-wise, meaning the first element of the first list is divided by the first element of the second list, the second element by the second, and so on. The result should be a list of floating-point numbers.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure both lists have the same length, as element-wise operations require this.
2. **Element-wise Division**: Iterate over the elements of both lists simultaneously, dividing each element of the first list by the corresponding element of the second list.
3. **Result Storage**: Store the results of these divisions in a new list.
4. **Return the Result**: Return the list containing the division results.

### Pseudocode

```
function div_list(list1, list2):
    if length of list1 is not equal to length of list2:
        raise an error or handle the mismatch
    
    result = empty list
    for each index i from 0 to length of list1 - 1:
        divide list1[i] by list2[i] and store the result in result list
    
    return result
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def div_list(list1, list2):
    # Check if both lists have the same length
    if len(list1) != len(list2):
        raise ValueError("Both lists must have the same length.")
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over the elements of both lists
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        # Perform element-wise division and append the result to the result list
        result.append(list1[i] / list2[i])
    
    # Return the list of results
    return result
```

This solution ensures that the function performs element-wise division correctly and handles the case where the input lists are not of the same length by raising a `ValueError`. The division results are stored in a list and returned as floating-point numbers.

Also, here are some of your memories.
Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.
