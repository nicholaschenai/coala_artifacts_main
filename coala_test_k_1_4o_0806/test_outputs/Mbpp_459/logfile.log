INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/459 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to create a function that takes a string as input and removes all contiguous sequences of uppercase letters from it. The result should be a string that only contains the lowercase letters and any other characters that were not part of an uppercase sequence.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string character by character. We will keep track of whether we are currently in an uppercase sequence. If we encounter an uppercase letter, we will skip it and continue skipping until we find a non-uppercase letter. If we encounter a non-uppercase letter, we will add it to our result string. This way, we effectively remove all uppercase substrings.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the final output.
2. Initialize a boolean variable `in_uppercase` to `False` to track if we are in an uppercase sequence.
3. Iterate over each character `char` in the input string:
   - If `char` is an uppercase letter:
     - Set `in_uppercase` to `True`.
   - Else (if `char` is not an uppercase letter):
     - If `in_uppercase` is `True`, set it to `False` (indicating the end of an uppercase sequence).
     - Append `char` to `result`.
4. Return the `result` string.

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def remove_uppercase(s: str) -> str:
    # Initialize an empty string to store the result
    result = ""
    # Boolean flag to track if we are in an uppercase sequence
    in_uppercase = False
    
    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is uppercase
        if char.isupper():
            # If it is uppercase, set the flag to True
            in_uppercase = True
        else:
            # If it is not uppercase and we were in an uppercase sequence
            if in_uppercase:
                # Set the flag to False as we are exiting the uppercase sequence
                in_uppercase = False
            # Append the non-uppercase character to the result
            result += char
    
    # Return the final result string
    return result
```

This code will correctly remove all uppercase substrings from the input string, as specified in the problem statement.

    [Task]:
        The chef is having one string of English lower case alphabets only. The chef wants to remove all "abc" special pairs where a,b,c are occurring consecutively. After removing the pair, create a new string and again remove "abc" special pair from a newly formed string. Repeate the process until no such pair remains in a string.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a single line of input, $String$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each testcase, output in a single line answer, new String with no "abc" special pair.

        -----Constraints:-----
        $T \leq 2 $
        $1 \leq String length \leq 1000 $

        -----Sample Input:-----
        2
        aabcc
        bababccc

        -----Sample Output:-----
        ac
        bc

        -----EXPLANATION:-----
        For 1) after removing "abc" at middle we get a new string as ac.
        For 2) string = bababccc
        newString1 = babcc  // After removing middle "abc"
        newString2 = bc   //After removing "abc"

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We have a string consisting of lowercase English letters. We need to repeatedly remove any occurrence of the substring "abc" from the string until no such substring exists. We need to perform this operation for multiple test cases and output the resulting string for each test case.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a stack-based approach. We will iterate through each character of the string and use a stack to build the resulting string. Whenever we encounter the sequence "abc" in the stack, we will remove it. This process will be repeated until we have processed all characters in the string. The stack will help us efficiently manage the removal of "abc" sequences.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           For each test case:
               Initialize an empty stack
               For each character in the string:
                   Push the character onto the stack
                   If the top three characters in the stack form "abc":
                       Pop the top three characters from the stack
               Convert the stack to a string and output it
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        def remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases):
            results = []
            for string in test_cases:
                stack = []
                for char in string:
                    stack.append(char)
                    # Check if the last three characters in the stack form "abc"
                    if len(stack) >= 3 and stack[-3:] == ['a', 'b', 'c']:
                        # Remove the "abc" from the stack
                        stack.pop()
                        stack.pop()
                        stack.pop()
                # Convert the stack back to a string
                results.append(''.join(stack))
            return results

        # Read input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        # First line is the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])
        test_cases = data[1:T+1]

        # Get the results
        results = remove_abc_pairs(T, test_cases)

        # Print the results
        for result in results:
            print(result)
        ```

        This solution uses a stack to efficiently manage the removal of "abc" sequences from the string. By checking the top three elements of the stack, we can determine when to remove the sequence and continue processing the rest of the string.
