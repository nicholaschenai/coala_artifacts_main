INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/294 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a list containing both strings and numbers and returns the maximum numerical value from that list. The list is heterogeneous, meaning it contains elements of different data types, but we are only interested in the numerical values.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Filter the List**: First, we need to filter out the non-numeric elements from the list. We can do this by checking the type of each element.
2. **Find the Maximum**: Once we have a list of only numeric elements, we can use Python's built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a function `max_val` that takes a list `lst` as an argument.
2. Initialize an empty list `numeric_values` to store numeric elements.
3. Iterate over each element `item` in `lst`:
   - If `item` is an instance of `int` or `float`, append it to `numeric_values`.
4. Use the `max()` function to find the maximum value in `numeric_values`.
5. Return the maximum value.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def max_val(lst):
    # Initialize a list to store numeric values
    numeric_values = []
    
    # Iterate over each item in the input list
    for item in lst:
        # Check if the item is an integer or a float
        if isinstance(item, (int, float)):
            # Add the numeric item to the numeric_values list
            numeric_values.append(item)
    
    # Return the maximum value from the numeric_values list
    return max(numeric_values)
```

This solution iterates through the list, filters out non-numeric elements, and then finds the maximum value among the numeric elements. The use of `isinstance()` ensures that we only consider integers and floats, which are the numeric types in Python.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this task, I implemented a system called ANGEN to perform various operations on a list of integers. The core concepts involved handling different types of queries efficiently, including updating values, calculating sums, and finding maximum, minimum, second maximum, and second minimum values within specified ranges. The challenge was to ensure that each operation was performed correctly and efficiently, given the constraints.

    The key strategy was to use a list to store the integers, allowing for direct access and updates. For operations like finding the second maximum or minimum, I used a set to handle unique values and sorted them to find the desired result. This approach ensured that the operations were both correct and efficient.

    One potential pitfall was handling the indices correctly, as the input uses 1-based indexing while Python lists use 0-based indexing. Adjusting the indices appropriately was crucial to avoid off-by-one errors. Additionally, handling invalid operations and edge cases, such as when there are not enough unique values to find a second maximum or minimum, was important to ensure robustness.

    Overall, the experience reinforced the importance of careful index management and the use of sets for handling unique values in range-based operations. The solution was successful, passing all test cases without any errors.

We need to write a function that finds the maximum numerical value in a list that contains both strings and numbers. The function should ignore the strings and only consider the numerical values when determining the maximum.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Filter the List**: Iterate through the list and filter out only the numerical values.
2. **Find the Maximum**: Use Python's built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value among the filtered numerical values.
3. **Return the Result**: Return the maximum value found.

### Pseudocode

1. Initialize an empty list to store numerical values.
2. Loop through each element in the input list:
   - If the element is an integer, add it to the list of numerical values.
3. Use the `max()` function to find the maximum value in the list of numerical values.
4. Return the maximum value.

### Final Python Solution

```python
def max_val(lst):
    # Step 1: Filter out only the numerical values from the list
    numerical_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    
    # Step 2: Find the maximum value among the numerical values
    max_value = max(numerical_values)
    
    # Step 3: Return the maximum value
    return max_value
```

This solution iterates through the list, filters out non-integer elements, and then uses the `max()` function to find and return the maximum integer value.
