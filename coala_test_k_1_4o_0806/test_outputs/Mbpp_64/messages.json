The function should return a new list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the second element (the mark) of each tuple.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will use Python's built-in sorting capabilities to sort the list of tuples.\n2. The `sorted()` function can be used to sort the list, and we can specify a custom sorting key.\n3. The custom key will be a function that extracts the second element of each tuple, which is the mark.\n4. The `sorted()` function will then sort the tuples based on these extracted marks.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `subject_marks` that takes a list of tuples `marks_list` as input.\n2. Use the `sorted()` function to sort `marks_list`.\n   - Use a lambda function as the key to extract the second element of each tuple.\n3. Return the sorted list.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef subject_marks(marks_list):\n    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple\n    sorted_list = sorted(marks_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    return sorted_list\n```\n\nThis function will take a list of tuples, sort them by the second element of each tuple (the mark), and return the sorted list."

The challenge was to correctly sort the problems based on this difficulty measure.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved:\n    1. Parsing the input to extract scores and contestant numbers for each problem.\n    2. Sorting the subtasks of each problem by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers.\n    3. Using a tuple `(decrease_count, index)` to represent the difficulty, which allowed for easy sorting of problems by difficulty and index.\n\n    A key insight was recognizing that sorting the subtasks by score simplifies the process of counting decreases in contestant numbers. This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially with the number of problems being as large as 100,000.\n\n    The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into these steps, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt. This problem reinforced the importance of sorting and tuple-based sorting for handling complex sorting criteria.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
