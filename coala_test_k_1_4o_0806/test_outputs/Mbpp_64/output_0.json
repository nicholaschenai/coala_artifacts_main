    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples as input. Each tuple contains a subject name and a corresponding mark. The function should return a new list of tuples sorted by the marks in ascending order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in sorting capabilities. We will sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple, which represents the marks. This can be achieved by using a custom sorting key that extracts the second element from each tuple.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   - Define a function `subject_marks` that takes a list of tuples as input.\n   - Use the `sorted` function to sort the list.\n   - Specify a lambda function as the key for sorting, which extracts the second element (marks) from each tuple.\n   - Return the sorted list.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef subject_marks(marks_list):\n    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (the marks)\n    # Use a lambda function as the key to extract the second element for sorting\n    sorted_list = sorted(marks_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    # Return the sorted list\n    return sorted_list\n```\n\nThis solution uses Python's `sorted` function with a lambda function to specify that sorting should be based on the second element of each tuple. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in capabilities for sorting.",
