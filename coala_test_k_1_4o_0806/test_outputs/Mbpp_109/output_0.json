    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to determine how many numbers are odd when we rotate a given binary string a specified number of times. Each rotation involves moving the first character of the string to the end. After each rotation, we convert the binary string to a decimal number and check if it is odd.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Start with the given binary string.\n   - For each rotation (up to the specified number of times):\n     - Rotate the string by moving the first character to the end.\n     - Convert the rotated binary string to a decimal number.\n     - Check if the decimal number is odd.\n     - Count how many of these numbers are odd.\n   - Return the count of odd numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function odd_Equivalent(binary_string, num_rotations):\n       count_odd = 0\n       for i from 0 to num_rotations - 1:\n           rotate the binary_string by moving the first character to the end\n           convert the rotated binary_string to a decimal number\n           if the decimal number is odd:\n               increment count_odd\n       return count_odd\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_Equivalent(binary_string: str, num_rotations: int) -> int:\n    count_odd = 0  # Initialize the count of odd numbers\n    for _ in range(num_rotations):\n        # Rotate the binary string by moving the first character to the end\n        binary_string = binary_string[1:] + binary_string[0]\n        # Convert the rotated binary string to a decimal number\n        decimal_value = int(binary_string, 2)\n        # Check if the decimal number is odd\n        if decimal_value % 2 == 1:\n            count_odd += 1  # Increment the count if the number is odd\n    return count_odd  # Return the total count of odd numbers\n```",
