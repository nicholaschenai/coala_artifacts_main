    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence from the start of a list up to a given index `i`, and this subsequence must also include a specific element at index `k`, where `k` is greater than `i`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - First, we need to find all possible increasing subsequences that end at index `i`.\n   - For each of these subsequences, we will check if we can extend it by including the element at index `k`.\n   - We will calculate the sum of these subsequences and keep track of the maximum sum found.\n   - To do this efficiently, we can use a dynamic programming approach where we maintain an array `dp` such that `dp[j]` stores the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence ending at index `j`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n       Initialize dp array of size i+1 with zeros\n       Initialize max_sum to 0\n       \n       for j from 0 to i:\n           dp[j] = arr[j]\n           for m from 0 to j-1:\n               if arr[m] < arr[j]:\n                   dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[m] + arr[j])\n           if arr[j] < arr[k]:\n               max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[j] + arr[k])\n       \n       return max_sum\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n    # Initialize dp array to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences ending at each index\n    dp = [0] * (i + 1)\n    # Variable to keep track of the maximum sum found\n    max_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each index from 0 to i\n    for j in range(i + 1):\n        # Start with the current element as the sum of the subsequence ending at j\n        dp[j] = arr[j]\n        # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with arr[j]\n        for m in range(j):\n            if arr[m] < arr[j]:\n                # Update dp[j] to the maximum sum of subsequences ending at j\n                dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[m] + arr[j])\n        # If the current subsequence can be extended by including arr[k], update max_sum\n        if arr[j] < arr[k]:\n            max_sum = max(max_sum, dp[j] + arr[k])\n    \n    # Return the maximum sum found\n    return max_sum\n```",
