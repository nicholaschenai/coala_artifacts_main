This subsequence must also include the element at index `k`.\n\n2. **Calculate the Maximum Sum**: For each element up to index `i`, calculate the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence that ends at that element. Then, check if this subsequence can be extended to include the element at index `k`.\n\n3. **Include the kth Element**: For each subsequence ending at an index `j` (where `j <= i`), if the element at index `j` is less than the element at index `k`, add the element at index `k` to the sum of the subsequence ending at `j`.\n\n4. **Find the Maximum**: The result will be the maximum sum obtained by including the element at index `k` in any of the valid subsequences.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n    initialize max_sum array of size i+1 with zeros\n\n    for j from 0 to i:\n        set max_sum[j] to arr[j]\n        for m from 0 to j-1:\n            if arr[m] < arr[j]:\n                max_sum[j] = max(max_sum[j], max_sum[m] + arr[j])\n\n    result = 0\n    for j from 0 to i:\n        if arr[j] < arr[k]:\n            result = max(result, max_sum[j] + arr[k])\n\n    return result\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_sum_increasing_subseq(arr, n, i, k):\n    # Initialize an array to store the maximum sum of increasing subsequences\n    # ending at each index up to i\n    max_sum = [0] * (i + 1)\n    \n    # Calculate the maximum sum of increasing subsequences for each index up to i\n    for j in range(i + 1):\n        max_sum[j] = arr[j]\n        for m in range(j):\n            if arr[m] < arr[j]:\n                max_sum[j] = max(max_sum[j], max_sum[m] + arr[j])\n    \n    # Find the maximum sum of subsequences that can be extended to include arr[k]\n    result = 0\n    for j in range(i + 1):\n        if arr[j] < arr[k]:\n            result = max(result, max_sum[j] + arr[k])\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution calculates the maximum sum of increasing subsequences up to index `i` and checks if they can be extended to include the element at index `k`. The result is the maximum sum of such subsequences."

The core concept here is dynamic programming, which is a common approach for solving problems involving subsequences or subarrays.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved maintaining a dynamic programming array `d`, where each element `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`. The key insight is to iterate over each element and check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. This approach ensures that we consider all possible subsequences ending at each element.\n\n    The solution was implemented with an O(n^2) time complexity, which is acceptable for the problem's constraints. The implementation passed all tests, confirming its correctness.\n\n    Here's the final code snippet for future reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n            if not nums:\n                return 0\n        \n            n = len(nums)\n            d = [1] * n\n        \n            for i in range(1, n):\n                for j in range(i):\n                    if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                        d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n            return max(d)\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the utility of dynamic programming for subsequence problems and highlighted the importance of carefully updating the state array to reflect the longest subsequences found.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
