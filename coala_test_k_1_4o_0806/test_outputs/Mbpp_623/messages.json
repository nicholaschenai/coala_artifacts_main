The function should return a new list where each number from the original list is raised to the power of `n`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will iterate over each number in the input list.\n   - For each number, we will compute its `n`-th power.\n   - We will collect these computed values into a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return this new list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `nth_nums` that takes a list `numbers` and an integer `n`.\n   - Initialize an empty list `result`.\n   - For each `number` in `numbers`:\n     - Compute `number` raised to the power of `n`.\n     - Append the result to the `result` list.\n   - Return the `result` list.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef nth_nums(numbers: list, n: int) -> list:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each number in the input list\n    for number in numbers:\n        # Compute the n-th power of the current number\n        powered_number = number ** n\n        # Append the computed power to the result list\n        result.append(powered_number)\n    \n    # Return the list containing all the n-th powers\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each element in the input list, computes its `n`-th power, and collects the results in a new list, which is then returned."

We are given multiple test cases, each with different values of \\( N \\) and \\( K \\).\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find all combinations of unique positive integers such that their \\( K \\)-th powers sum up to \\( N \\).\n\n        2. **Recursive Backtracking**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers. Starting from 1, we try to include each integer's \\( K \\)-th power in the sum and recursively check if we can reach the target sum \\( N \\).\n\n        3. **Base Cases**:\n           - If the sum of powers equals \\( N \\), we have found a valid combination.\n           - If the sum exceeds \\( N \\), we stop exploring that path.\n\n        4. **Recursive Case**: For each integer starting from 1, we decide whether to include its \\( K \\)-th power in the current sum and recursively attempt to complete the sum with the next integers.\n\n        5. **Avoid Duplicates**: Ensure that each combination of integers is unique by always considering integers in increasing order.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        1. Define a recursive function `countWays(current_sum, start)`:\n           - If `current_sum` equals \\( N \\), increment the count of valid combinations.\n           - If `current_sum` exceeds \\( N \\), return.\n           - For each integer `i` starting from `start`:\n             - Calculate `i^K`.\n             - Recursively call `countWays(current_sum + i^K, i + 1)`.\n\n        2. For each test case, initialize the count to 0 and call `countWays(0, 1)`.\n\n        3. Output the count for each test case.\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        def countWays(N, K, current_sum, start):\n            if current_sum == N:\n                return 1\n            if current_sum > N:\n                return 0\n    \n            count = 0\n            i = start\n            while True:\n                power = i ** K\n                if current_sum + power > N:\n                    break\n                count += countWays(N, K, current_sum + power, i + 1)\n                i += 1\n            return count\n\n        def solve():\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.read\n            data = input().split()\n    \n            index = 0\n            T = int(data[index])\n            index += 1\n    \n            results = []\n            for _ in range(T):\n                N = int(data[index])\n                K = int(data[index + 1])\n                index += 2\n        \n                result = countWays(N, K, 0, 1)\n                results.append(result)\n    \n            for res in results:\n                print(res)\n\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \\( K \\)-th powers sum up to \\( N \\). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed accordingly.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n        None\n\n        Tests failed:\n         Input: ['2', '4 1', '38 2'] Expected output: [{'2'}, {'1'}] # Execution output: []\n        No output detected.
