INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/623 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes a list of numbers and an integer `n`. The function should return a new list where each number from the original list is raised to the power of `n`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each number in the input list.
   - For each number, we will compute its `n`-th power.
   - We will collect these computed values into a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `nth_nums` that takes a list `numbers` and an integer `n`.
   - Initialize an empty list `result`.
   - For each `number` in `numbers`:
     - Compute `number` raised to the power of `n`.
     - Append the result to the `result` list.
   - Return the `result` list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def nth_nums(numbers: list, n: int) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for number in numbers:
        # Compute the n-th power of the current number
        powered_number = number ** n
        # Append the computed power to the result list
        result.append(powered_number)
    
    # Return the list containing all the n-th powers
    return result
```

This solution iterates over each element in the input list, computes its `n`-th power, and collects the results in a new list, which is then returned.

        Problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
        After that Cheffina came and read what chef wrote in the problem statement, for having some fun Cheffina made some changes in the problem statement as.
        New problem statement: N can be obtained as the sum of Kth power of unique +ve integers in multiple ways, find total number ways?
        But, the chef is now confused, how to solve a new problem statement, help the chef to solve this new problem statement.

        -----Input:-----
        - First-line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. 
        - Each test case contains a single line of input, two integers $N, K$. 

        -----Output:-----
        For each test case, output in a single line answer to the problem statement.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 10$
        - $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
        - $1 \leq K \leq 6$

        For 1) 4 can be obtained by as [ 4^1 ], [1^1, 3^1], [2^1, 2^1]. (here ^ stands for power)
        But here [2^1, 2^1] is not the valid way because it is not made up of unique +ve integers. 
        For 2) 38 can be obtained in the way which is [2^2, 3^2, 5^2] = 4 + 9 + 25

        ## Problem Restatement

        We need to determine the number of ways to express a given natural number \( N \) as the sum of unique positive integers raised to the power \( K \). We are given multiple test cases, each with different values of \( N \) and \( K \).

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each test case, we need to find all combinations of unique positive integers such that their \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \).

        2. **Recursive Backtracking**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of integers. Starting from 1, we try to include each integer's \( K \)-th power in the sum and recursively check if we can reach the target sum \( N \).

        3. **Base Cases**:
           - If the sum of powers equals \( N \), we have found a valid combination.
           - If the sum exceeds \( N \), we stop exploring that path.

        4. **Recursive Case**: For each integer starting from 1, we decide whether to include its \( K \)-th power in the current sum and recursively attempt to complete the sum with the next integers.

        5. **Avoid Duplicates**: Ensure that each combination of integers is unique by always considering integers in increasing order.

        ## Pseudocode

        1. Define a recursive function `countWays(current_sum, start)`:
           - If `current_sum` equals \( N \), increment the count of valid combinations.
           - If `current_sum` exceeds \( N \), return.
           - For each integer `i` starting from `start`:
             - Calculate `i^K`.
             - Recursively call `countWays(current_sum + i^K, i + 1)`.

        2. For each test case, initialize the count to 0 and call `countWays(0, 1)`.

        3. Output the count for each test case.

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        def countWays(N, K, current_sum, start):
            if current_sum == N:
                return 1
            if current_sum > N:
                return 0
    
            count = 0
            i = start
            while True:
                power = i ** K
                if current_sum + power > N:
                    break
                count += countWays(N, K, current_sum + power, i + 1)
                i += 1
            return count

        def solve():
            import sys
            input = sys.stdin.read
            data = input().split()
    
            index = 0
            T = int(data[index])
            index += 1
    
            results = []
            for _ in range(T):
                N = int(data[index])
                K = int(data[index + 1])
                index += 2
        
                result = countWays(N, K, 0, 1)
                results.append(result)
    
            for res in results:
                print(res)

        ```

        This solution uses a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of unique integers whose \( K \)-th powers sum up to \( N \). The function `countWays` is called for each test case, and the results are printed accordingly.

We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and an integer `n`, and returns a new list where each number in the original list is raised to the power of `n`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Input Understanding**: We have a list of integers and a single integer `n`. We need to compute the `n`-th power of each integer in the list.

2. **Iterate and Compute**: For each number in the list, compute its `n`-th power and store the result in a new list.

3. **Return the Result**: After processing all numbers, return the new list containing the powered numbers.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `nth_nums(nums, n)`:
   - Initialize an empty list `result`.
   - For each number `num` in `nums`:
     - Compute `num ** n` and append it to `result`.
   - Return `result`.
