Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length of consecutive uppercase characters found so far.\n2. Initialize another variable to keep track of the current length of consecutive uppercase characters as we iterate through the string.\n3. Loop through each character in the string:\n   - If the character is uppercase, increment the current length counter.\n   - If the character is not uppercase, compare the current length counter with the maximum length counter and update the maximum if necessary. Then reset the current length counter to zero.\n4. After the loop, perform a final check to update the maximum length counter in case the string ends with an uppercase run.\n5. Return the maximum length counter.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction max_run_uppercase(s):\n    max_length = 0\n    current_length = 0\n    \n    for each character in s:\n        if character is uppercase:\n            increment current_length\n        else:\n            if current_length > max_length:\n                max_length = current_length\n            reset current_length to 0\n    \n    if current_length > max_length:\n        max_length = current_length\n    \n    return max_length\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef max_run_uppercase(s: str) -> int:\n    # Initialize the maximum length of consecutive uppercase characters\n    max_length = 0\n    # Initialize the current length of consecutive uppercase characters\n    current_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is uppercase\n        if char.isupper():\n            # Increment the current length counter\n            current_length += 1\n        else:\n            # Update the maximum length if the current run is longer\n            if current_length > max_length:\n                max_length = current_length\n            # Reset the current length counter\n            current_length = 0\n    \n    # Final check in case the string ends with an uppercase run\n    if current_length > max_length:\n        max_length = current_length\n    \n    # Return the maximum length found\n    return max_length\n```"

A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements. The task is to determine the length of the longest subsequence where each element is greater than the preceding one.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We will maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. Initially, each element in `d` is set to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element in the list, we will check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence will be the maximum value in the `d` array.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function lengthOfLIS(nums):\n               if nums is empty:\n                   return 0\n       \n               n = length of nums\n               d = array of size n initialized to 1\n       \n               for i from 1 to n-1:\n                   for j from 0 to i-1:\n                       if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                           d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n       \n               return max value in d\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n                # If the input list is empty, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 0\n                if not nums:\n                    return 0\n        \n                # Initialize the dynamic programming array with 1s\n                # Each element is a subsequence of length 1 by itself\n                n = len(nums)\n                d = [1] * n\n        \n                # Iterate over each element in the list\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence\n                    for j in range(i):\n                        if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                            # Update the dp array to reflect the longest subsequence ending at i\n                            d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)\n        \n                # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the dp array\n                return max(d)\n        ```\n\n        This solution uses dynamic programming to achieve an O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable for the problem's requirements.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [[10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]] Output: 4\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
