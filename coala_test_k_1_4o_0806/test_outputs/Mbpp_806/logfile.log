INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/806 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence (or "run") of uppercase letters in that string.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length of consecutive uppercase characters found so far.
2. Initialize another variable to keep track of the current length of consecutive uppercase characters as we iterate through the string.
3. Loop through each character in the string:
   - If the character is uppercase, increment the current length counter.
   - If the character is not uppercase, compare the current length counter with the maximum length counter and update the maximum if necessary. Then reset the current length counter to zero.
4. After the loop, perform a final check to update the maximum length counter in case the string ends with an uppercase run.
5. Return the maximum length counter.

## Pseudocode

```
function max_run_uppercase(s):
    max_length = 0
    current_length = 0
    
    for each character in s:
        if character is uppercase:
            increment current_length
        else:
            if current_length > max_length:
                max_length = current_length
            reset current_length to 0
    
    if current_length > max_length:
        max_length = current_length
    
    return max_length
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def max_run_uppercase(s: str) -> int:
    # Initialize the maximum length of consecutive uppercase characters
    max_length = 0
    # Initialize the current length of consecutive uppercase characters
    current_length = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is uppercase
        if char.isupper():
            # Increment the current length counter
            current_length += 1
        else:
            # Update the maximum length if the current run is longer
            if current_length > max_length:
                max_length = current_length
            # Reset the current length counter
            current_length = 0
    
    # Final check in case the string ends with an uppercase run
    if current_length > max_length:
        max_length = current_length
    
    # Return the maximum length found
    return max_length

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given an unsorted list of integers and need to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence within this list. A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements. The task is to determine the length of the longest subsequence where each element is greater than the preceding one.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           We can solve this problem using dynamic programming. We will maintain an array `d` where `d[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`. Initially, each element in `d` is set to 1 because the smallest subsequence ending at any element is the element itself. For each element in the list, we will check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence with the current element. If they can, we update `d[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `d[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element. Finally, the length of the longest increasing subsequence will be the maximum value in the `d` array.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function lengthOfLIS(nums):
               if nums is empty:
                   return 0
       
               n = length of nums
               d = array of size n initialized to 1
       
               for i from 1 to n-1:
                   for j from 0 to i-1:
                       if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                           d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
       
               return max value in d
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
                # If the input list is empty, the length of the longest increasing subsequence is 0
                if not nums:
                    return 0
        
                # Initialize the dynamic programming array with 1s
                # Each element is a subsequence of length 1 by itself
                n = len(nums)
                d = [1] * n
        
                # Iterate over each element in the list
                for i in range(1, n):
                    # Check all previous elements to see if they can form an increasing subsequence
                    for j in range(i):
                        if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                            # Update the dp array to reflect the longest subsequence ending at i
                            d[i] = max(d[i], d[j] + 1)
        
                # The length of the longest increasing subsequence is the maximum value in the dp array
                return max(d)
        ```

        This solution uses dynamic programming to achieve an O(n^2) time complexity, which is suitable for the problem's requirements.
