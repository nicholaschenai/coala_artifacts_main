The words in the list should be split based on spaces in the input string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - We will use Python's built-in string method `split()` which, by default, splits a string into a list of words based on spaces.\n   - This method will automatically handle multiple spaces and trim any leading or trailing spaces.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `string_to_list` that takes a single parameter `s` (a string).\n   - Use the `split()` method on the string `s` to split it into a list of words.\n   - Return the resulting list.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef string_to_list(s: str) -> list:\n    # Use the split method to divide the string into a list of words based on spaces\n    return s.split()\n```\n\nThis function will take a string, split it into words using spaces as delimiters, and return the list of words. The `split()` method is efficient and handles edge cases like multiple spaces or leading/trailing spaces automatically."

The core concept was to split each quote into words and check for the presence of \"not\". If found, the quote is classified as \"Real Fancy\"; otherwise, it is \"regularly fancy\".\n\n    Initially, the solution was structured as a function that wasn't called, and input/output handling was not aligned with competitive programming standards. The key learning was the importance of reading input from standard input and printing output directly to standard output, which is typical in such environments.\n\n    The successful strategy involved:\n    1. Reading the number of test cases and the quotes using `input()`.\n    2. Splitting each quote into words and checking for the word \"not\".\n    3. Printing the appropriate classification for each quote.\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of understanding input/output requirements in competitive programming and ensuring that functions are properly invoked. The solution was straightforward once these aspects were correctly implemented.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
