    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of words. The words in the list should be split based on spaces in the input string.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in string method `split()`. This method splits a string into a list where each word is a separate element, using spaces as the default delimiter. This will give us the desired list of words from the input string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   - Define a function named `string_to_list` that takes a single parameter `s` (a string).\n   - Use the `split()` method on the string `s` to divide it into a list of words.\n   - Return the resulting list.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef string_to_list(s: str) -> list:\n    # Use the split method to divide the string into a list of words\n    # The split method by default splits on spaces\n    return s.split()\n```\n\nThis function will take a string, split it into words based on spaces, and return the list of words.",
