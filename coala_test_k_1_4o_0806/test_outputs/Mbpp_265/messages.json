        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a list and an integer `n` as inputs. The function should split the list into `n` separate lists, where each list contains every `n`-th element from the original list, starting from different initial positions. The result should be a list of these `n` lists.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Initialize `n` empty lists**: We will create a list of `n` empty lists to store the results.\n2. **Iterate through the original list**: For each element in the original list, determine which of the `n` lists it should go into.\n3. **Distribute elements**: Use the index of the element modulo `n` to decide which of the `n` lists the element should be appended to.\n4. **Return the list of lists**: After processing all elements, return the list containing the `n` lists.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Create a list `result` containing `n` empty lists.\n2. For each index `i` and element `elem` in the input list:\n   - Determine the target list index as `i % n`.\n   - Append `elem` to `result[i % n]`.\n3. Return `result`.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef list_split(lst, n):\n    # Step 1: Initialize a list of n empty lists\n    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Step 2: Iterate over the input list with index\n    for i, elem in enumerate(lst):\n        # Step 3: Append the element to the appropriate sublist\n        result[i % n].append(elem)\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the list of lists\n    return result\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently distributes elements from the input list into `n` separate lists based on their index, ensuring that each list contains every `n`-th element from the original list."

The challenge was to efficiently generate and handle potentially large numbers of subarray sums, given the constraints.\n\n    ### Core Concepts and Patterns:\n    - **Subarray Sums**: The problem required generating all possible subarray sums, which involves iterating over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.\n    - **Sorting and Range Sum**: After generating the sums, sorting them and calculating the sum over a specified range was straightforward but required careful handling of indices due to 1-based indexing in the problem statement.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Nested Loops for Subarray Sums**: Using nested loops to calculate subarray sums was effective. The outer loop iterates over starting indices, and the inner loop calculates sums for subarrays starting at each index.\n    - **Sorting**: Sorting the list of subarray sums was necessary to access the sums in non-decreasing order.\n    - **Modulo Operation**: Since the result could be large, applying the modulo operation at the end ensured the result stayed within bounds.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def rangeSum(self, nums: List[int], n: int, left: int, right: int) -> int:\n            subarray_sums = []\n            for start in range(n):\n                current_sum = 0\n                for end in range(start, n):\n                    current_sum += nums[end]\n                    subarray_sums.append(current_sum)\n            subarray_sums.sort()\n            result = sum(subarray_sums[left - 1:right])\n            return result % (10**9 + 7)\n    ```\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of understanding subarray operations and efficient handling of large datasets through sorting and modular arithmetic. The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into generating, sorting, and summing subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"

The function should split the list into `n` separate lists, where each list contains every `n`-th element from the original list, starting from different initial positions. For example, if `n` is 3, the first list will contain elements at indices 0, 3, 6, etc., the second list will contain elements at indices 1, 4, 7, etc., and the third list will contain elements at indices 2, 5, 8, etc.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize an empty list to hold the resulting lists.\n   - For each index from 0 to `n-1`, create a new list.\n   - For each starting index, iterate over the original list, adding every `n`-th element to the new list.\n   - Append each of these new lists to the result list.\n   - Return the result list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function list_split(lst, n):\n       result = []\n       for i from 0 to n-1:\n           new_list = []\n           for j from i to length of lst, step by n:\n               add lst[j] to new_list\n           add new_list to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef list_split(lst, n):\n    # Initialize the result list to hold the split lists\n    result = []\n    \n    # Loop over each starting index from 0 to n-1\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Create a new list for the current starting index\n        new_list = []\n        \n        # Iterate over the list starting from index i, taking every nth element\n        for j in range(i, len(lst), n):\n            # Add the element to the new list\n            new_list.append(lst[j])\n        \n        # Add the new list to the result\n        result.append(new_list)\n    \n    # Return the list of split lists\n    return result\n```"
