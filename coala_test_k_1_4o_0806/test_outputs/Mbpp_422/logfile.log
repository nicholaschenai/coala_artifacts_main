INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/422 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The function should take an integer `n` as input and return the average of the cubes of numbers from 1 to `n`.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Identify the Range**: The first `n` natural numbers are the integers from 1 to `n`.
2. **Cube Each Number**: For each number in this range, calculate its cube.
3. **Sum the Cubes**: Add up all the cubes.
4. **Calculate the Average**: Divide the sum of the cubes by `n` to get the average.
5. **Return the Result**: The function should return this average.

## Pseudocode

```
function find_Average_Of_Cube(n):
    initialize sum_of_cubes to 0
    for each number i from 1 to n:
        add i^3 to sum_of_cubes
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    return average
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_Average_Of_Cube(n: int) -> float:
    # Initialize the sum of cubes to 0
    sum_of_cubes = 0
    
    # Loop through each number from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Add the cube of the current number to the sum
        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3
    
    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum of cubes by n
    average = sum_of_cubes / n
    
    # Return the calculated average
    return average
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.

    ### Strategy:
    - I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.
    - This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).

    ### Implementation:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.

   ```
   function find_Average_Of_Cube(n):
       initialize sum_of_cubes to 0
       for each number i from 1 to n:
           add i^3 to sum_of_cubes
       average = sum_of_cubes / n
       return average
