    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. For example, if `n` is 2, we need to find the average of the cubes of 1 and 2.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will:\n   - Calculate the cube of each natural number from 1 to `n`.\n   - Sum these cubes.\n   - Divide the sum by `n` to get the average.\n\n3. **Pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_Average_Of_Cube(n):\n       initialize sum_of_cubes to 0\n       for each number i from 1 to n:\n           add i^3 to sum_of_cubes\n       average = sum_of_cubes / n\n       return average\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_Average_Of_Cube(n: int) -> float:\n    # Initialize the sum of cubes to 0\n    sum_of_cubes = 0\n    \n    # Loop through each number from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Add the cube of the current number to the sum\n        sum_of_cubes += i ** 3\n    \n    # Calculate the average by dividing the sum of cubes by n\n    average = sum_of_cubes / n\n    \n    # Return the calculated average\n    return average\n```\n\nThis function calculates the average of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers by iterating through each number, cubing it, summing these cubes, and then dividing by `n` to find the average.",
