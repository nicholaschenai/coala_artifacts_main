        "content": "### Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to create a function that takes two tuples as input. Each tuple contains numbers. The function should subtract each element of the first tuple by the corresponding element in the second tuple (i.e., element-wise subtraction) and return a new tuple with the results.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. We will iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously.\n2. For each pair of elements (one from each tuple), we will subtract the element from the second tuple from the element in the first tuple.\n3. We will store the result of each subtraction in a new tuple.\n4. Finally, we will return the new tuple containing all the results.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `substract_elements` that takes two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`.\n2. Initialize an empty list `result`.\n3. Loop over the indices of the tuples (assuming both tuples are of the same length):\n   - Subtract the element at the current index of `tuple2` from the element at the same index of `tuple1`.\n   - Append the result to the `result` list.\n4. Convert the `result` list to a tuple.\n5. Return the resulting tuple.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef substract_elements(tuple1: tuple, tuple2: tuple) -> tuple:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the results of the subtraction\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the indices of the tuples\n    for i in range(len(tuple1)):\n        # Subtract the element in tuple2 from the element in tuple1 at the same index\n        subtraction = tuple1[i] - tuple2[i]\n        # Append the result to the result list\n        result.append(subtraction)\n    \n    # Convert the result list to a tuple and return it\n    return tuple(result)\n```"

The challenge was to correctly sort the problems based on this difficulty measure.\n\n    The strategy that worked involved:\n    1. Parsing the input to extract scores and contestant numbers for each problem.\n    2. Sorting the subtasks of each problem by score and counting the decreases in contestant numbers.\n    3. Using a tuple `(decrease_count, index)` to represent the difficulty, which allowed for easy sorting of problems by difficulty and index.\n\n    A key insight was recognizing that sorting the subtasks by score simplifies the process of counting decreases in contestant numbers. This approach efficiently handles the constraints, especially with the number of problems being as large as 100,000.\n\n    The solution was straightforward once the problem was broken down into these steps, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt. This problem reinforced the importance of sorting and tuple-based sorting for handling complex sorting criteria.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
