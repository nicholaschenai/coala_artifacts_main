The function should convert these strings to integers, sort them in ascending order, and return the sorted list of integers.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Convert Strings to Integers**: First, we need to convert each string in the list to an integer. This will allow us to sort them numerically rather than lexicographically (which is how strings are sorted by default).\n   \n2. **Sort the List**: Once we have a list of integers, we can sort it using Python's built-in sorting functionality, which sorts numbers in ascending order by default.\n\n3. **Return the Sorted List**: Finally, we return the sorted list of integers.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `sort_numeric_strings` that takes a list of strings as input.\n2. Convert each string in the list to an integer.\n3. Sort the list of integers.\n4. Return the sorted list.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef sort_numeric_strings(lst: list) -> list:\n    # Convert each string in the list to an integer\n    int_list = [int(num) for num in lst]\n    \n    # Sort the list of integers\n    int_list.sort()\n    \n    # Return the sorted list\n    return int_list\n```\n\nThis solution follows the steps outlined in the conceptual solution and pseudocode. It uses list comprehension to convert the strings to integers and the `sort()` method to sort the list. The function then returns the sorted list of integers."

The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.\n\n    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.\n\n    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\n    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:\n    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.\n    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.\n    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
