    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all characters that have odd index positions removed.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate over the string and collect characters that are at even index positions (0, 2, 4, etc.). We can achieve this by using a loop that increments by 2, starting from index 0, or by using Python's slicing feature to directly extract characters at even indices.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function odd_values_string(s):\n       Initialize an empty string result\n       for index from 0 to length of s, incrementing by 2:\n           Append the character at the current index to result\n       return result\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, using slicing:\n\n   ```\n   function odd_values_string(s):\n       return s[::2]\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_values_string(s: str) -> str:\n    # Use slicing to get every character at even indices\n    # This effectively skips characters at odd indices\n    return s[::2]\n```\n\nThis solution uses Python's slicing feature to efficiently extract characters at even indices, which are the ones we want to keep in the resulting string.",
