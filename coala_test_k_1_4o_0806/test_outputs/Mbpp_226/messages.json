        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string. This new string should only contain the characters from the original string that are located at even index positions (0, 2, 4, etc.).\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - To solve this problem, we can iterate over the string using a loop. For each character in the string, we check its index. If the index is even, we add the character to a new string. Finally, we return this new string.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Initialize an empty string to store the result.\n   - Loop through the original string using an index.\n   - For each character, check if the index is even.\n   - If the index is even, append the character to the result string.\n   - After the loop, return the result string.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef odd_values_string(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty string to store the result\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Loop through the string using an index\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Check if the index is even\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # Append the character at the even index to the result string\n            result += s[i]\n    \n    # Return the result string containing characters at even indices\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each character in the input string, checks if the index is even, and constructs a new string with only those characters. The final result is returned."

Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string. For each character in the string:\n           - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.\n           - If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack.\n           - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.\n           - Finally, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function removeDuplicates(s, k):\n               Initialize an empty stack\n       \n               for each character in s:\n                   if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:\n                       Increment the count of the top element in the stack\n                       if count equals k:\n                           Pop the top element from the stack\n                   else:\n                       Push (character, 1) onto the stack\n       \n               Initialize result as an empty string\n               for each (character, count) in stack:\n                   Append character repeated count times to result\n       \n               return result\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n                # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n                stack = []\n        \n                # Iterate over each character in the string\n                for char in s:\n                    if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                        # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character\n                        stack[-1][1] += 1  # Increment the count of the top element\n                        if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                            # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack\n                            stack.pop()\n                    else:\n                        # If the stack is empty or the top character is different, push the current character with count 1\n                        stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n                # Reconstruct the result string from the stack\n                result = ''\n                for char, count in stack:\n                    result += char * count  # Append the character repeated 'count' times\n        \n                return result\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently manages the removal of `k` adjacent duplicates using a stack, ensuring that the operations are performed in linear time relative to the length of the string.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['\"abcd\"', 2] Output: \"abcd\"\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
