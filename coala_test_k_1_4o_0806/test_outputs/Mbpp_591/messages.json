The function should then return the modified list.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - First, check if the list has more than one element. If it doesn't, swapping the first and last elements doesn't make sense, so we can return the list as is.\n   - If the list has more than one element, swap the first element with the last element.\n   - Return the modified list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   Define function swap_List that takes a list as input\n       If the length of the list is less than 2\n           Return the list as is\n       Otherwise\n           Swap the first element with the last element\n       Return the modified list\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef swap_List(lst):\n    # Check if the list has more than one element\n    if len(lst) < 2:\n        # If not, return the list as is\n        return lst\n    \n    # Swap the first and last elements\n    lst[0], lst[-1] = lst[-1], lst[0]\n    \n    # Return the modified list\n    return lst\n```\n\nThis function will correctly swap the first and last elements of the list, provided the list has at least two elements. If the list has fewer than two elements, it will simply return the list unchanged."

The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.\n\n    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.\n\n    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.\n\n    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:\n    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.\n    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.\n    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. \n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
