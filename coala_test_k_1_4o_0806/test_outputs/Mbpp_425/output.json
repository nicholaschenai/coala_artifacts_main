    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts how many sublists within a list of lists contain a specific element. For example, if we have a list of lists and we want to count how many of these lists contain the number 1, the function should return that count.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate over each sublist in the main list. For each sublist, we will check if the specified element is present. If it is, we will increment a counter. Finally, we will return the counter as the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter to 0\n   For each sublist in the list of lists:\n       If the element is in the sublist:\n           Increment the counter\n   Return the counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_element_in_list(list_of_lists, element):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of sublists containing the element\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of lists\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Check if the element is present in the current sublist\n        if element in sublist:\n            # Increment the counter if the element is found\n            count += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of sublists containing the element\n    return count\n```",
