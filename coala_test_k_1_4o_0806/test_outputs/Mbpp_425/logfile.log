INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/425 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that takes a list of sublists and a particular element. The function should return the count of sublists that contain the specified element.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Initialize a counter to zero.
   - Iterate over each sublist in the main list.
   - For each sublist, check if the specified element is present.
   - If the element is found in the sublist, increment the counter by one.
   - After checking all sublists, return the counter as the result.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function count_element_in_list(list_of_sublists, element):
       initialize counter to 0
       for each sublist in list_of_sublists:
           if element is in sublist:
               increment counter by 1
       return counter
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def count_element_in_list(list_of_sublists, element):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of sublists containing the element
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each sublist in the list of sublists
    for sublist in list_of_sublists:
        # Check if the element is present in the current sublist
        if element in sublist:
            # Increment the counter if the element is found
            count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of sublists containing the element
    return count
```

This function will correctly count the number of sublists that contain the specified element, as required by the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.
    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.

    ### Strategy:
    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.
    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.
    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            prefix_sums = {0: 1}
            current_sum = 0
            count = 0
        
            for num in nums:
                current_sum += num
                needed_sum = current_sum - k
                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:
                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]
                if current_sum in prefix_sums:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
                else:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1
        
            return count
    ```

    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.
