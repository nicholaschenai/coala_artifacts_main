INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/641 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the nth nonagonal number. A nonagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the nonagon (a nine-sided polygon). The nth nonagonal number can be calculated using a specific formula.

2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**

   To find the nth nonagonal number, we can use the formula for nonagonal numbers: 
   \[
   N(n) = \frac{7n^2 - 5n}{2}
   \]
   This formula gives us the nth nonagonal number directly. We will implement this formula in a function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth nonagonal number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function is_nonagonal(n):
       Calculate nonagonal number using formula: (7 * n^2 - 5 * n) / 2
       Return the calculated nonagonal number
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_nonagonal(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth nonagonal number using the formula
    nonagonal_number = (7 * n * n - 5 * n) // 2
    # Return the calculated nonagonal number
    return nonagonal_number
```

This function will correctly compute the nth nonagonal number using the given formula.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:

    1. **Formula Derivation**:
       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.

    2. **Handling the First Term**:
       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.

    3. **Efficiency**:
       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.

    4. **Code Simplicity**:
       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.

    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.

A nonagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the nonagon (a nine-sided polygon). The task is to find the formula for the nth nonagonal number and implement it in a function.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   Nonagonal numbers can be calculated using a specific formula. The nth nonagonal number can be determined using the formula:
