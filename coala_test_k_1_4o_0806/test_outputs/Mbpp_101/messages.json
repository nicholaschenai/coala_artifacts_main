        "content": "\n### Problem Restatement\n\n1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n   - We need to create a function that takes an array (list) and an integer `k` as inputs. The function should return the element at the `k`-th position in the array, using 1-based indexing. This means that if `k` is 1, we return the first element of the array, if `k` is 2, we return the second element, and so on.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Since Python uses 0-based indexing, we need to adjust the index by subtracting 1 from `k` to access the correct element in the list. For example, to get the 1st element (1-based), we access the 0th index (0-based). Therefore, the solution involves simply returning the element at index `k-1` from the list.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `kth_element` that takes a list `arr` and an integer `k`.\n   - Return the element at index `k-1` from the list `arr`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef kth_element(arr: list, k: int) -> int:\n    # Return the element at the (k-1)th index of the list to account for 1-based indexing\n    return arr[k - 1]\n```\n\nThis function will correctly return the `k`-th element of the list using 1-based indexing by accessing the `(k-1)`-th index of the list."

The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.\n    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.\n    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.\n    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n            prefix_sums = {0: 1}\n            current_sum = 0\n            count = 0\n        \n            for num in nums:\n                current_sum += num\n                needed_sum = current_sum - k\n                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]\n                if current_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1\n                else:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1\n        \n            return count\n    ```\n\n    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
