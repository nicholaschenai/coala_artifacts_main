### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that takes an array (list) and an integer `k` as inputs. The function should return the element at the `k`-th position in the array, using 1-based indexing. This means that if `k` is 1, we return the first element of the array, if `k` is 2, we return the second element, and so on.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Since Python uses 0-based indexing, we need to adjust the index by subtracting 1 from `k` to access the correct element in the list. For example, to get the 1st element (1-based), we access the 0th index (0-based). Therefore, the solution involves simply returning the element at index `k-1` from the list.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `kth_element` that takes a list `arr` and an integer `k`.
   - Return the element at index `k-1` from the list `arr`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def kth_element(arr: list, k: int) -> int:
    # Return the element at the (k-1)th index of the list to account for 1-based indexing
    return arr[k - 1]
```

This function will correctly return the `k`-th element of the list using 1-based indexing by accessing the `(k-1)`-th index of the list.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.
    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.

    ### Strategy:
    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.
    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.
    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            prefix_sums = {0: 1}
            current_sum = 0
            count = 0
        
            for num in nums:
                current_sum += num
                needed_sum = current_sum - k
                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:
                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]
                if current_sum in prefix_sums:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
                else:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1
        
            return count
    ```

    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.

   We need to write a function that takes an array and an integer `k` as inputs and returns the `k`th element of the array. The indexing is 1-based, meaning the first element of the array is at position 1.

   To solve this problem, we will access the element at the `k-1` index of the array. This is because Python uses 0-based indexing, so the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on. Therefore, to get the `k`th element in 1-based indexing, we need to access the element at index `k-1`.
