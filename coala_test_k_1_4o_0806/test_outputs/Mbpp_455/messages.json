These correspond to the month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12.\n   - The function should check if the given month number is one of these numbers.\n   - If it is, the function should return `True`.\n   - If it is not, the function should return `False`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `check_monthnumb_number` that takes an integer `month_number`.\n   - Create a set or list of month numbers that have 31 days: `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`.\n   - Check if `month_number` is in this set.\n   - Return `True` if it is, otherwise return `False`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**\n\n```python\ndef check_monthnumb_number(month_number: int) -> bool:\n    # Set of month numbers that have 31 days\n    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}\n    \n    # Check if the given month number is in the set of months with 31 days\n    return month_number in months_with_31_days\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if a given month number corresponds to a month with 31 days."

That is, every match has a winner and a loser. \n        With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  \n        Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.\n\n        -----Input:-----\n        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n        - Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.\n\n        -----Output:-----\n        - If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\n        - Otherwise print \"YES\" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. \n        - If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. \n        - You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.\n        - You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.\n\n        -----Constraints-----\n        - $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n        - $2 \\leq N \\leq 100$\n\n        -----Subtasks-----\n        - 10 points : $2 \\leq N \\leq 6$\n        - 90 points :  Original Constraints. \n\n        -----Sample Input:-----\n        2\n        3\n        2\n\n        -----Sample Output:-----\n        YES\n        010\n        001\n        100\n        NO\n\n        -----Explanation:-----\n        One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.\n    [/Task]\n\n    [Previous Critique]:\n        ### Analysis of the Issue\n\n        The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve_tournament` was defined but never called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the input is read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output. The function should be called with the appropriate input to produce the expected output.\n\n        ### Steps to Correct the Code\n\n        1. **Reading Input**: We need to read the number of test cases and the list of player counts from standard input.\n        2. **Calling the Function**: Ensure that the function `solve_tournament` is called with the correct arguments.\n        3. **Output**: The function should print the results directly to standard output.\n\n        ### Revised Solution\n\n        Here's the corrected code with the necessary input handling and function call:\n\n        ```python\n        def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):\n            for N in test_cases:\n                if N % 2 == 0:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    for i in range(N):\n                        result = \"\"\n                        for j in range(N):\n                            if i == j:\n                                result += \"0\"\n                            elif (j - i + N) % N <= (N - 1) // 2:\n                                result += \"1\"\n                            else:\n                                result += \"0\"\n                        print(result)\n\n        # Read input from standard input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        # First line is the number of test cases\n        T = int(data[0])\n\n        # The following lines are the number of players for each test case\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\n        # Call the function with the parsed input\n        solve_tournament(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of Changes\n\n        - **Input Handling**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases, and the subsequent elements are the number of players for each test case.\n        - **Function Call**: We call `solve_tournament` with the number of test cases and the list of player counts.\n        - **Output**: The function prints the results directly, which is expected in a competitive programming setup. \n\n        This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the given test cases.\n    [/Previous Critique]\n\n    [Thought Process and Code]:\n        ```python\n        def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):\n            for N in test_cases:\n                if N % 2 == 0:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    for i in range(N):\n                        result = \"\"\n                        for j in range(N):\n                            if i == j:\n                                result += \"0\"\n                            elif (j - i + N) % N <= (N - 1) // 2:\n                                result += \"1\"\n                            else:\n                                result += \"0\"\n                        print(result)\n\n        # Read input from standard input\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n\n        # First line is the number of test cases\n        T = int(data[0])\n\n        # The following lines are the number of players for each test case\n        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]\n\n        # Call the function with the parsed input\n        solve_tournament(T, test_cases)\n        ```\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['2', '3', '2'] Output: YES\n        010\n        001\n        100\n        NO\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
