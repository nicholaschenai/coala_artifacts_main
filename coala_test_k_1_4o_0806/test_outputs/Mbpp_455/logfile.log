INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/455 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a month number (from 1 to 12) as input and returns `True` if that month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We know that the months with 31 days are January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. These correspond to the month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12.
   - The function should check if the given month number is one of these numbers.
   - If it is, the function should return `True`.
   - If it is not, the function should return `False`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `check_monthnumb_number` that takes an integer `month_number`.
   - Create a set or list of month numbers that have 31 days: `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`.
   - Check if `month_number` is in this set.
   - Return `True` if it is, otherwise return `False`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments.**

```python
def check_monthnumb_number(month_number: int) -> bool:
    # Set of month numbers that have 31 days
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    
    # Check if the given month number is in the set of months with 31 days
    return month_number in months_with_31_days
```

This function will correctly determine if a given month number corresponds to a month with 31 days.

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        A tennis tournament is about to take place with $N$ players participating in it.
        Every player plays with every other player exactly once and there are no ties. That is, every match has a winner and a loser. 
        With Naman's birthday approaching, he wants to make sure that each player wins the same number of matches so that nobody gets disheartened.  
        Your task is to determine if such a scenario can take place and if yes find one such scenario.

        -----Input:-----
        - First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
        - Each testcase contains of a single integer $N$ denoting number of players.

        -----Output:-----
        - If it's impossible for everyone to win the same number of matches, print "NO" (without quotes).
        - Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and then print $N$ lines , each line should consist of a string containing only 0s and 1s and should be of size $N$. 
        - If the jth character in the ith line is 1 then it means in the match between $i$ and $j$ , $i$ wins. 
        - You will get a WA if the output does not correspond to a valid tournament, or if the constraints are not satisfied.
        - You will get also WA verdict if any 2 lines have contradicting results or if a player beats himself.

        -----Constraints-----
        - $1 \leq T \leq 100$
        - $2 \leq N \leq 100$

        -----Subtasks-----
        - 10 points : $2 \leq N \leq 6$
        - 90 points :  Original Constraints. 

        -----Sample Input:-----
        2
        3
        2

        -----Sample Output:-----
        YES
        010
        001
        100
        NO

        -----Explanation:-----
        One such scenario for $N$ = $3$ is when player $1$ beats player $2$, player $2$ to beats player $3$ and player $3$ beats player $1$. Here all players win exactly $1$ match.

        ### Analysis of the Issue

        The feedback indicates that the code did not produce any output. This suggests that the function `solve_tournament` was defined but never called. In a typical competitive programming environment, the input is read from standard input, and the output is written to standard output. The function should be called with the appropriate input to produce the expected output.

        ### Steps to Correct the Code

        1. **Reading Input**: We need to read the number of test cases and the list of player counts from standard input.
        2. **Calling the Function**: Ensure that the function `solve_tournament` is called with the correct arguments.
        3. **Output**: The function should print the results directly to standard output.

        ### Revised Solution

        Here's the corrected code with the necessary input handling and function call:

        ```python
        def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
            for N in test_cases:
                if N % 2 == 0:
                    print("NO")
                else:
                    print("YES")
                    for i in range(N):
                        result = ""
                        for j in range(N):
                            if i == j:
                                result += "0"
                            elif (j - i + N) % N <= (N - 1) // 2:
                                result += "1"
                            else:
                                result += "0"
                        print(result)

        # Read input from standard input
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()

        # First line is the number of test cases
        T = int(data[0])

        # The following lines are the number of players for each test case
        test_cases = [int(data[i]) for i in range(1, T + 1)]

        # Call the function with the parsed input
        solve_tournament(T, test_cases)
        ```

        ### Explanation of Changes

        - **Input Handling**: We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and split it into a list of strings. The first element is the number of test cases, and the subsequent elements are the number of players for each test case.
        - **Function Call**: We call `solve_tournament` with the number of test cases and the list of player counts.
        - **Output**: The function prints the results directly, which is expected in a competitive programming setup. 

        This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the given test cases.

        def solve_tournament(T, test_cases):
            for N in test_cases:
                if N % 2 == 0:

                        print(result)

   We need to write a function that checks if a given month number corresponds to a month with 31 days. The function should return `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   There are specific months that have 31 days: January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. These correspond to the month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12. The function will check if the input month number is one of these and return `True` if it is, otherwise it will return `False`.
