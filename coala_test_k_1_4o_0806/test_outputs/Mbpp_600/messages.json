If the number is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - A number is considered even if it is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. In other words, if the remainder when dividing the number by 2 is zero, the number is even. We can use the modulus operator `%` to determine this. If `number % 2 == 0`, then the number is even.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `is_Even` that takes one parameter `number`.\n   - Use the modulus operator to check if `number % 2` equals zero.\n   - If it does, return `True`.\n   - Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_Even(number: int) -> bool:\n    # Check if the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder\n    if number % 2 == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if a given integer is even by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is zero. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating the number is even; otherwise, it returns `False`."

The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.\n\n    ### Key Insights:\n    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.\n    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.\n\n    ### Strategies:\n    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.\n    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    def countDivisors(n):\n        count = 0\n        i = 1\n        while i * i <= n:\n            if n % i == 0:\n                count += 1\n                if i != n // i:\n                    count += 1\n            i += 1\n        return count\n\n    def solve():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            A = int(data[index])\n            B = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            diff = abs(A - B)\n        \n            if diff == 0:\n                results.append(-1)\n            else:\n                results.append(countDivisors(diff))\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    solve()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
