INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/600 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that checks if a given integer is even. If the number is even, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - A number is considered even if it is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. In other words, if the remainder when dividing the number by 2 is zero, the number is even. We can use the modulus operator `%` to determine this. If `number % 2 == 0`, then the number is even.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `is_Even` that takes one parameter `number`.
   - Use the modulus operator to check if `number % 2` equals zero.
   - If it does, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def is_Even(number: int) -> bool:
    # Check if the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function will correctly determine if a given integer is even by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is zero. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating the number is even; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Also, here are some of your memories.
Feel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.
Do not confuse the memories with the problem statement.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the core concept was to determine the number of divisors of the absolute difference between two numbers, `A` and `B`, which represent the roll numbers of Ram and Shyam. The problem required identifying how many values of `p` would allow them to receive the same set of questions, based on the condition `((A-1) % p) == ((B-1) % p)`.

    ### Key Insights:
    - **Mathematical Insight**: The condition simplifies to finding divisors of `|A-B|`. If `A` equals `B`, the difference is zero, leading to infinitely many solutions.
    - **Divisor Counting**: Efficiently counting divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility.

    ### Strategies:
    - **Initial Misstep**: The initial solution did not execute because the function `solve()` was not called. This was a simple oversight but crucial for the program to run.
    - **Correct Approach**: After ensuring the function was called, the solution correctly read input, processed each test case, and output the results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    def countDivisors(n):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
            i += 1
        return count

    def solve():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            A = int(data[index])
            B = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            diff = abs(A - B)
        
            if diff == 0:
                results.append(-1)
            else:
                results.append(countDivisors(diff))
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    solve()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of ensuring that functions are called in scripts and highlighted the utility of mathematical simplification in problem-solving.
