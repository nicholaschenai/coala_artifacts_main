    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the median of these numbers. The median is the middle value when the numbers are sorted in order.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the median of three numbers, we can sort the numbers and then select the middle one. Since there are only three numbers, sorting them is straightforward. The median will be the second number in the sorted list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named median_numbers that takes three parameters: a, b, c.\n   Create a list containing the three numbers: [a, b, c].\n   Sort the list.\n   Return the second element of the sorted list as a float.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef median_numbers(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> float:\n    # Create a list of the three numbers\n    numbers = [a, b, c]\n    # Sort the list\n    numbers.sort()\n    # Return the second element of the sorted list as a float, which is the median\n    return float(numbers[1])\n```",
