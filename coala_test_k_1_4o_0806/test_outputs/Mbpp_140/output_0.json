    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numbers. The function should return a set containing all unique numbers from all the tuples combined.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate over each tuple in the list and then iterate over each number in the tuple. We will add each number to a set, which will automatically handle duplicates for us. Finally, we will return the set containing all unique numbers.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function extract_singly that takes a list of tuples as input\n       Initialize an empty set called result_set\n       For each tuple in the list\n           For each number in the tuple\n               Add the number to result_set\n       Return result_set\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef extract_singly(list_of_tuples):\n    # Initialize an empty set to store unique numbers\n    result_set = set()\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for tuple_ in list_of_tuples:\n        # Iterate over each number in the current tuple\n        for number in tuple_:\n            # Add the number to the set (duplicates are automatically handled)\n            result_set.add(number)\n    \n    # Return the set containing all unique numbers\n    return result_set\n```",
