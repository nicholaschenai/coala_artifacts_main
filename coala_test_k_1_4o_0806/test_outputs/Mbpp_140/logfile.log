INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/140 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numbers. The function should return a set containing all the unique numbers from these tuples.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each tuple in the list.
   - For each tuple, we will iterate over each number.
   - We will add each number to a set, which automatically handles duplicates.
   - Finally, we will return the set containing all unique numbers.

3. **Pseudocode Solution:**
   ```
   Define function extract_singly that takes a list of tuples as input
       Initialize an empty set called result_set
       For each tuple in the list
           For each number in the tuple
               Add the number to result_set
       Return result_set
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def extract_singly(list_of_tuples):
    # Initialize an empty set to store unique numbers
    result_set = set()
    
    # Iterate over each tuple in the list
    for tuple_ in list_of_tuples:
        # Iterate over each number in the current tuple
        for number in tuple_:
            # Add the number to the set (duplicates are automatically handled)
            result_set.add(number)
    
    # Return the set containing all unique numbers
    return result_set
```

This solution iterates through each element in the list of tuples and adds each number to a set, ensuring that only unique numbers are stored. The function then returns this set.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to find the number of unique results from bitwise OR operations on all contiguous subarrays of a given array of non-negative integers. The core concept here is understanding how the bitwise OR operation works and how it can be efficiently computed over subarrays.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Bitwise OR Properties**: The OR operation is cumulative in the sense that adding more elements to a subarray can only maintain or increase the OR result.
    - **Set for Uniqueness**: Using a set to track results ensures that duplicates are automatically handled, which is crucial for counting unique results.

    ### Strategy:
    - **Dynamic Approach**: Instead of recalculating the OR for every possible subarray, maintain a set of results from the previous iteration (`prev`). For each new element, compute the OR with each element in `prev` and add the new element itself. This reduces redundant calculations.
    - **Iterative Update**: For each element in the array, update the `prev` set with new OR results and add these to a global `results` set to track all unique OR results.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    from typing import List

    class Solution:
        def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
            results = set()
            prev = set()
        
            for x in A:
                current = {x}
                for y in prev:
                    current.add(x | y)
                prev = current
                results.update(current)
        
            return len(results)
    ```

    This approach efficiently computes the number of unique OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to manage unique results. The solution passed all tests, confirming its correctness and efficiency.
