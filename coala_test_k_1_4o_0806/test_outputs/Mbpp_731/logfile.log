INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/731 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cone. The function will take two inputs: the radius \( r \) of the base of the cone and the height \( h \) of the cone. The function should return the lateral surface area as a floating-point number.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the Formula**: The lateral surface area \( A \) of a cone can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \pi \times r \times l
   \]
   where \( l \) is the slant height of the cone. The slant height can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}
   \]

2. **Steps to Calculate**:
   - Calculate the slant height \( l \) using the formula \( l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2} \).
   - Use the slant height to calculate the lateral surface area using the formula \( A = \pi \times r \times l \).

3. **Return the Result**: Return the calculated lateral surface area.

## Pseudocode

```
function lateralsurface_cone(r, h):
    calculate slant height l = sqrt(r^2 + h^2)
    calculate lateral surface area A = Ï€ * r * l
    return A
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
import math

def lateralsurface_cone(r: float, h: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem
    l = math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)
    # Calculate the lateral surface area
    lateral_surface_area = math.pi * r * l
    # Return the lateral surface area
    return lateral_surface_area
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), the core concepts involved understanding the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \( a \) and \( b \) given these constraints.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).
    - **Area Formula**: The area \( S \) is given by \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \).

    ### Strategy:
    - **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \( a \).
    - **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.
    - **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.
    - **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.
    - **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    import sys
    import math

    def find_triangle_sides():
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            H = int(data[index])
            S = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            if 2 * S > H * H:
                results.append("-1")
                continue
        
            try:
                discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S
                if discriminant < 0:
                    results.append("-1")
                    continue
            
                a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
                a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
            
                b1 = 2 * S / a1
                b2 = 2 * S / a2
            
                if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:
                    results.append(f"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:
                    results.append(f"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                else:
                    results.append("-1")
            except ValueError:
                results.append("-1")
    
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    find_triangle_sides()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation and precision handling in computational geometry problems.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/731 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cone. The function will take two inputs: the radius of the base of the cone and the height of the cone. The output should be the lateral surface area of the cone.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To find the lateral surface area of a cone, we need to use the formula for the lateral surface area, which is \(\pi \times r \times l\), where \(r\) is the radius of the base and \(l\) is the slant height of the cone. The slant height \(l\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: \(l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}\), where \(h\) is the height of the cone. Once we have the slant height, we can plug it into the lateral surface area formula to get the result.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function lateralsurface_cone(r, h):
       Calculate slant height l using the formula: l = sqrt(r^2 + h^2)
       Calculate lateral surface area using the formula: area = Ï€ * r * l
       Return the calculated area
   ```

    # Calculate the lateral surface area using the formula Ï€ * r * l
    area = math.pi * r * l
    # Return the calculated lateral surface area
