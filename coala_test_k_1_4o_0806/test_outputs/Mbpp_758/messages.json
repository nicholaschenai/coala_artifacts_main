The function should return a dictionary where each unique list from the input is converted to a tuple (since lists can't be dictionary keys) and the value is the count of how many times that list appears in the input list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the tuples and their counts.\n   - Iterate over each sublist in the input list.\n   - Convert each sublist to a tuple.\n   - Check if the tuple is already a key in the dictionary:\n     - If it is, increment its count by 1.\n     - If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.\n   - Return the dictionary after processing all sublists.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function unique_sublists(list_of_lists):\n       create an empty dictionary called count_dict\n       for each sublist in list_of_lists:\n           convert sublist to a tuple called tuple_key\n           if tuple_key is in count_dict:\n               increment count_dict[tuple_key] by 1\n           else:\n               set count_dict[tuple_key] to 1\n       return count_dict\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef unique_sublists(list_of_lists):\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each tuple\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate over each sublist in the input list\n    for sublist in list_of_lists:\n        # Convert the sublist to a tuple to use as a dictionary key\n        tuple_key = tuple(sublist)\n        \n        # Check if the tuple is already a key in the dictionary\n        if tuple_key in count_dict:\n            # If it is, increment its count by 1\n            count_dict[tuple_key] += 1\n        else:\n            # If it is not, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1\n            count_dict[tuple_key] = 1\n    \n    # Return the dictionary containing tuples and their counts\n    return count_dict\n```"

However, reflecting on the official solution provides some insights:\n\n    1. **Data Structures**: The official solution uses a dictionary to map scores to the number of contestants, which is a neat way to handle the association between scores and contestants. This approach is similar to my use of `zip` to pair scores and contestants, but the dictionary provides direct access to the number of contestants for a given score.\n\n    2. **Sorting and Counting**: Both solutions involve sorting the scores and counting the number of decreases in the number of contestants. The official solution uses a simple loop with `zip` to compare consecutive elements, which is a clean and efficient way to count decreases.\n\n    3. **Handling Ties**: The official solution uses a dictionary to group problems by their difficulty score and then sorts these groups. This is an effective way to handle ties, ensuring that problems with the same difficulty are sorted by their indices.\n\n    4. **Output**: The official solution constructs a final list of problem indices by iterating over sorted difficulty scores and their associated problem indices. This approach is clear and ensures the correct order of output.\n\n    Overall, both solutions are similar in logic and efficiency. The official solution's use of dictionaries for grouping and sorting is a useful technique for handling ties and organizing data, which can be applied to similar problems in the future.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
