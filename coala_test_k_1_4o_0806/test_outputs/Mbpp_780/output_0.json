    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple is the sum of two tuples from the input list. The sum is calculated by adding the first elements of the two tuples and the second elements of the two tuples separately.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   - We will iterate over each pair of tuples in the input list.\n   - For each pair, we will calculate a new tuple where the first element is the sum of the first elements of the two tuples, and the second element is the sum of the second elements of the two tuples.\n   - We will store each resulting tuple in a new list.\n   - Finally, we will return the list of resulting tuples.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize an empty list called result\n   For each tuple1 in the list of tuples:\n       For each tuple2 in the list of tuples:\n           If tuple1 is not the same as tuple2:\n               Calculate the sum of the first elements of tuple1 and tuple2\n               Calculate the sum of the second elements of tuple1 and tuple2\n               Create a new tuple with these sums\n               Append the new tuple to the result list\n   Return the result list\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_combinations(tuple_list):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the result\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the list\n    for i in range(len(tuple_list)):\n        tuple1 = tuple_list[i]\n        \n        # Iterate over each tuple again to form pairs\n        for j in range(len(tuple_list)):\n            tuple2 = tuple_list[j]\n            \n            # Ensure we are not pairing the tuple with itself\n            if i != j:\n                # Calculate the sum of the first elements and the second elements\n                sum_first = tuple1[0] + tuple2[0]\n                sum_second = tuple1[1] + tuple2[1]\n                \n                # Create a new tuple with these sums\n                new_tuple = (sum_first, sum_second)\n                \n                # Append the new tuple to the result list\n                result.append(new_tuple)\n    \n    # Return the list of resulting tuples\n    return result\n```",
