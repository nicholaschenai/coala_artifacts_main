INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/792 [generation text] Sure, let's go through the problem-solving process step by step.

### 1. Restate the problem in plain English

We need to write a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the number of lists contained within it.

### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English

The task is straightforward: we need to count how many lists are present in the given list. Since the input is a list of lists, we can simply return the length of the outer list, which will give us the number of inner lists.

### 3. Write a pseudocode solution

1. Define a function named `count_list` that takes one parameter, `list_of_lists`.
2. Use the `len()` function to determine the number of elements in `list_of_lists`.
3. Return the result from step 2.

### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments

```python
def count_list(list_of_lists: list) -> int:
    # Use the len() function to count the number of lists in the input list
    return len(list_of_lists)
```

This function will correctly count and return the number of lists in the provided list of lists.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Recursive Approach**: The official solution uses a recursive lambda function `unflatten` to handle the depth of processing. This is a concise way to manage the alternating direction and depth levels, which was a challenge in my initial attempts.

    2. **Direction Handling**: The official solution effectively uses list slicing and indexing to handle both left-to-right and right-to-left processing. The use of `[0, 1][c&1]` to toggle between directions based on the current depth (`c`) is a clever way to manage direction without explicit conditionals.

    3. **Subarray Processing**: The `parse` function in the official solution handles subarray processing by checking if the current element is a list and recursively parsing it. This ensures that nested structures are correctly processed at each depth level.

    4. **Index Management**: The use of list slicing and the ternary operator to decide whether to create a subarray or add an element directly is efficient. The solution uses `mod` to determine the size of the subarray and adjusts the index accordingly, which was a point of failure in my attempts.

    5. **Conciseness and Efficiency**: The official solution is more concise and efficient, using Python's list slicing and indexing capabilities to handle complex operations in fewer lines of code. This highlights the importance of leveraging Python's built-in features for more elegant solutions.

    Overall, the official solution provides a more robust and efficient approach to solving the problem, particularly in handling direction changes and recursive subarray processing. This experience underscores the value of concise code and the effective use of Python's capabilities in solving complex problems.

INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/792 [generation text] 1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

   We need to write a function that counts how many lists are present within a given list of lists.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To solve this problem, we need to iterate over the main list and count each element that is itself a list. This can be done by checking the type of each element. If the element is a list, we increment our count. Finally, we return the total count.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define a function count_list that takes a single parameter, a list of lists.
   Initialize a counter to zero.
   For each element in the list:
       Check if the element is a list.
       If it is a list, increment the counter by one.
   Return the counter.
