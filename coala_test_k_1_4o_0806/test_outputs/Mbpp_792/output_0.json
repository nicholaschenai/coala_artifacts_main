    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts how many lists are present within a given list of lists.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to iterate over the main list and count each element that is itself a list. This can be done by checking the type of each element. If the element is a list, we increment our count. Finally, we return the total count.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function count_list that takes a single parameter, a list of lists.\n   Initialize a counter to zero.\n   For each element in the list:\n       Check if the element is a list.\n       If it is a list, increment the counter by one.\n   Return the counter.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count_list(lists):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of lists\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for element in lists:\n        # Check if the current element is a list\n        if isinstance(element, list):\n            # Increment the counter if the element is a list\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of lists\n    return count\n```",
