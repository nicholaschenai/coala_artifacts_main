    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function named `is_not_prime` that takes an integer as input and returns `True` if the number is not a prime number, and `False` if it is a prime number. For example, the function should return `False` for the input `2` because `2` is a prime number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if a number is not prime, we can check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We can do this by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If we find any divisor in this range, the number is not prime. If no divisors are found, the number is prime.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Function is_not_prime(n):\n       If n is less than 2:\n           Return True (since numbers less than 2 are not prime)\n       For each number i from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive):\n           If n is divisible by i:\n               Return True (n is not prime)\n       Return False (n is prime)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_not_prime(n: int) -> bool:\n    # Numbers less than 2 are not prime\n    if n < 2:\n        return True\n    \n    # Check for divisors from 2 to the square root of n\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return True  # n is not prime if it has a divisor other than 1 and itself\n    \n    return False  # n is prime if no divisors are found\n```",
