INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/131 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where only the vowels in the original string are reversed. The consonants and other characters should remain in their original positions. The vowels in this context are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase).

## Conceptual Solution

1. Identify all the vowels in the input string and store them in a list.
2. Reverse the list of vowels.
3. Create a new list to build the result string.
4. Iterate through the original string:
   - If the character is a vowel, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed list.
   - If the character is not a vowel, keep it unchanged.
5. Join the list into a string and return it.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `reverse_vowels` that takes a string `s`.
2. Create a set of vowels for quick lookup.
3. Initialize an empty list `vowels` to store the vowels from the string.
4. Iterate over each character in the string `s`:
   - If the character is a vowel, append it to the `vowels` list.
5. Reverse the `vowels` list.
6. Initialize an empty list `result` to build the final string.
7. Initialize a counter `vowel_index` to 0.
8. Iterate over each character in the string `s`:
   - If the character is a vowel, append the vowel at `vowel_index` from the reversed `vowels` list to `result` and increment `vowel_index`.
   - If the character is not a vowel, append it unchanged to `result`.
9. Join the `result` list into a string and return it.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def reverse_vowels(s: str) -> str:
    # Define a set of vowels for quick lookup
    vowels_set = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    
    # Extract all vowels from the string
    vowels = [char for char in s if char in vowels_set]
    
    # Reverse the list of vowels
    vowels.reverse()
    
    # Initialize a list to build the result string
    result = []
    
    # Initialize a counter to track the position in the reversed vowels list
    vowel_index = 0
    
    # Iterate over each character in the original string
    for char in s:
        if char in vowels_set:
            # If the character is a vowel, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed list
            result.append(vowels[vowel_index])
            vowel_index += 1
        else:
            # If the character is not a vowel, keep it unchanged
            result.append(char)
    
    # Join the list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(result)
```

    [Task]:
        Given a stringÂ s, a kÂ duplicate removalÂ consists of choosing kÂ adjacent and equal letters fromÂ s and removingÂ them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.
        We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.
        Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.
        It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
Â 
        Example 1:
        Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
        Output: "abcd"
        Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
        Example 2:
        Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
        Output: "aa"
        Explanation: 
        First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
        Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
        Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
        Example 3:
        Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
        Output: "ps"

Â 
        Constraints:

        1 <= s.length <= 10^5
        2 <= k <= 10^4
        s only contains lower case English letters.

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string. For each character in the string:
           - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.
           - If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack.
           - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.
           - Finally, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function removeDuplicates(s, k):
               Initialize an empty stack
       
               for each character in s:
                   if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:
                       Increment the count of the top element in the stack
                       if count equals k:
                           Pop the top element from the stack
                   else:
                       Push (character, 1) onto the stack
       
               Initialize result as an empty string
               for each (character, count) in stack:
                   Append character repeated count times to result
       
               return result
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
                # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts
                stack = []
        
                # Iterate over each character in the string
                for char in s:
                    if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:
                        # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character
                        stack[-1][1] += 1  # Increment the count of the top element
                        if stack[-1][1] == k:
                            # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack
                            stack.pop()
                    else:
                        # If the stack is empty or the top character is different, push the current character with count 1
                        stack.append([char, 1])
        
                # Reconstruct the result string from the stack
                result = ''
                for char, count in stack:
                    result += char * count  # Append the character repeated 'count' times
        
                return result
        ```

        This solution efficiently manages the removal of `k` adjacent duplicates using a stack, ensuring that the operations are performed in linear time relative to the length of the string.
