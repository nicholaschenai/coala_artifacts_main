        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where only the vowels in the original string are reversed. The consonants and other characters should remain in their original positions. The vowels in this context are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both uppercase and lowercase).\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Identify all the vowels in the input string and store them in a list.\n2. Reverse the list of vowels.\n3. Create a new list to build the result string.\n4. Iterate through the original string:\n   - If the character is a vowel, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed list.\n   - If the character is not a vowel, keep it unchanged.\n5. Join the list into a string and return it.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `reverse_vowels` that takes a string `s`.\n2. Create a set of vowels for quick lookup.\n3. Initialize an empty list `vowels` to store the vowels from the string.\n4. Iterate over each character in the string `s`:\n   - If the character is a vowel, append it to the `vowels` list.\n5. Reverse the `vowels` list.\n6. Initialize an empty list `result` to build the final string.\n7. Initialize a counter `vowel_index` to 0.\n8. Iterate over each character in the string `s`:\n   - If the character is a vowel, append the vowel at `vowel_index` from the reversed `vowels` list to `result` and increment `vowel_index`.\n   - If the character is not a vowel, append it unchanged to `result`.\n9. Join the `result` list into a string and return it.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef reverse_vowels(s: str) -> str:\n    # Define a set of vowels for quick lookup\n    vowels_set = set('aeiouAEIOU')\n    \n    # Extract all vowels from the string\n    vowels = [char for char in s if char in vowels_set]\n    \n    # Reverse the list of vowels\n    vowels.reverse()\n    \n    # Initialize a list to build the result string\n    result = []\n    \n    # Initialize a counter to track the position in the reversed vowels list\n    vowel_index = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the original string\n    for char in s:\n        if char in vowels_set:\n            # If the character is a vowel, replace it with the next vowel from the reversed list\n            result.append(vowels[vowel_index])\n            vowel_index += 1\n        else:\n            # If the character is not a vowel, keep it unchanged\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return it\n    return ''.join(result)\n```"

Our task is to repeatedly remove any sequence of `k` adjacent and identical characters from the string until no more such sequences exist. We then return the resulting string.\n\n        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n           To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of characters and their counts as we iterate through the string. For each character in the string:\n           - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has the same character, we increment the count of that character.\n           - If the count reaches `k`, we remove the character from the stack.\n           - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack has a different character, we push the character onto the stack with a count of 1.\n           - Finally, we reconstruct the string from the stack by repeating each character according to its count.\n\n        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n           ```\n           function removeDuplicates(s, k):\n               Initialize an empty stack\n       \n               for each character in s:\n                   if stack is not empty and stack top character is the same as current character:\n                       Increment the count of the top element in the stack\n                       if count equals k:\n                           Pop the top element from the stack\n                   else:\n                       Push (character, 1) onto the stack\n       \n               Initialize result as an empty string\n               for each (character, count) in stack:\n                   Append character repeated count times to result\n       \n               return result\n           ```\n\n        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:\n                # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of characters and their counts\n                stack = []\n        \n                # Iterate over each character in the string\n                for char in s:\n                    if stack and stack[-1][0] == char:\n                        # If the stack is not empty and the top character is the same as the current character\n                        stack[-1][1] += 1  # Increment the count of the top element\n                        if stack[-1][1] == k:\n                            # If the count reaches k, pop the element from the stack\n                            stack.pop()\n                    else:\n                        # If the stack is empty or the top character is different, push the current character with count 1\n                        stack.append([char, 1])\n        \n                # Reconstruct the result string from the stack\n                result = ''\n                for char, count in stack:\n                    result += char * count  # Append the character repeated 'count' times\n        \n                return result\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently manages the removal of `k` adjacent duplicates using a stack, ensuring that the operations are performed in linear time relative to the length of the string.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: ['\"abcd\"', 2] Output: \"abcd\"\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
