    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the nth polite number. A polite number is a positive integer that is not a power of 2. The task is to write a function that returns the nth polite number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the nth polite number, we can iterate through positive integers, checking if each number is a power of 2. If a number is not a power of 2, it is a polite number. We keep a count of how many polite numbers we have found. Once we reach the nth polite number, we return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter for polite numbers found to 0\n   Initialize a number to check starting from 1\n   While the counter is less than n:\n       Check if the current number is a power of 2\n       If it is not a power of 2:\n           Increment the polite number counter\n       If the counter equals n:\n           Return the current number\n       Increment the number to check\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two(x: int) -> bool:\n    # A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation\n    return x > 0 and (x & (x - 1)) == 0\n\ndef is_polite(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the count of polite numbers found\n    polite_count = 0\n    # Start checking from number 1\n    current_number = 1\n    \n    # Continue until we find the nth polite number\n    while polite_count < n:\n        # Check if the current number is not a power of two\n        if not is_power_of_two(current_number):\n            # Increment the count of polite numbers found\n            polite_count += 1\n            # If we have found the nth polite number, return it\n            if polite_count == n:\n                return current_number\n        # Move to the next number\n        current_number += 1\n```\n\nThis code defines a helper function `is_power_of_two` to check if a number is a power of two. The main function `is_polite` uses this helper to find and return the nth polite number by iterating through integers and counting those that are not powers of two.",
