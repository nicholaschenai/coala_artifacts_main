        "content": "## Problem Restatement\n\nThe task is to find the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that is not a power of 2. The function should return the nth polite number when given an integer n.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Polite Numbers**: Polite numbers are all positive integers except those that are powers of 2. For example, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, etc., are polite numbers, while 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., are not.\n\n2. **Generate Polite Numbers**: To find the nth polite number, we need to generate polite numbers in sequence and count them until we reach the nth one.\n\n3. **Check for Powers of 2**: To determine if a number is a power of 2, we can use the property that a number is a power of 2 if it has only one bit set in its binary representation. This can be checked using the condition `(x & (x - 1)) == 0`.\n\n4. **Iterate and Count**: Start from the number 1 and iterate upwards, checking each number to see if it is not a power of 2. Count each polite number until the nth one is found.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction is_polite(n):\n    count = 0\n    number = 1\n    while count < n:\n        if number is not a power of 2:\n            increment count\n        increment number\n    return the last polite number found\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef is_polite(n: int) -> int:\n    def is_power_of_two(x: int) -> bool:\n        # A number is a power of two if it has only one bit set in its binary representation\n        return (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and x != 0\n\n    count = 0\n    number = 1\n    while count < n:\n        if not is_power_of_two(number):\n            count += 1\n        number += 1\n    \n    # The loop exits when count == n, but number has been incremented one extra time\n    return number - 1\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Helper Function**: `is_power_of_two(x)` checks if a number is a power of two using bitwise operations.\n- **Main Logic**: We initialize `count` to 0 and `number` to 1. We iterate, checking each number to see if it is not a power of two. If it is not, we increment the `count`.\n- **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until `count` equals `n`, meaning we have found the nth polite number.\n- **Return Value**: Since `number` is incremented one extra time after finding the nth polite number, we return `number - 1`."

The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\n    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.\n\n    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. \n\n    Here is the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            steps = 0\n            while n != 1:\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    n //= 2\n                else:\n                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                        n -= 1\n                    else:\n                        n += 1\n                steps += 1\n            return steps\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"

If a number is not a power of 2, it is a polite number. We keep a count of how many polite numbers we have found. Once we reach the nth polite number, we return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize a counter for polite numbers found to 0\n   Initialize a number to check starting from 1\n   While the counter is less than n:\n       Check if the current number is a power of 2\n       If it is not a power of 2:\n           Increment the polite number counter\n       If the counter equals n:\n           Return the current number\n       Increment the number to check\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two(x: int) -> bool:\n    # A number is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation\n    return x > 0 and (x & (x - 1)) == 0\n\ndef is_polite(n: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the count of polite numbers found\n    polite_count = 0\n    # Start checking from number 1\n    current_number = 1\n    \n    # Continue until we find the nth polite number\n    while polite_count < n:\n        # Check if the current number is not a power of two\n        if not is_power_of_two(current_number):\n            # Increment the count of polite numbers found\n            polite_count += 1\n            # If we have found the nth polite number, return it\n            if polite_count == n:\n                return current_number\n        # Move to the next number\n        current_number += 1\n```\n\nThis code defines a helper function `is_power_of_two` to check if a number is a power of two. The main function `is_polite` uses this helper to find and return the nth polite number by iterating through integers and counting those that are not powers of two."
