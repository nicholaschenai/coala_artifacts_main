Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to create a function that takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain the sums of each pair of consecutive elements from the input tuple.\n\n### 2. Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we will:\n- Iterate through the input tuple, stopping one element before the end.\n- For each element, add it to the next element in the tuple.\n- Store each sum in a new list.\n- Convert the list of sums into a tuple and return it.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n```\nfunction add_pairwise(input_tuple):\n    initialize an empty list called result\n    for each index i from 0 to length of input_tuple - 2:\n        calculate the sum of input_tuple[i] and input_tuple[i + 1]\n        append the sum to the result list\n    convert the result list to a tuple\n    return the result tuple\n```\n\n### 4.

The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.\n\n    #### Key Insights and Strategies\n\n    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.\n\n    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N = test_case[0]\n            A = test_case[1]\n        \n            current_sum = 0\n            possible = True\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                current_sum += A[i]\n                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n        \n            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
