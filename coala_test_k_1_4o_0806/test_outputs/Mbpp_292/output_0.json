    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a Python function that takes two numbers as input and returns the quotient of the first number divided by the second number, rounded down to the nearest whole number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the quotient of two numbers rounded down, we can use integer division. In Python, this is done using the `//` operator, which divides two numbers and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find(a, b):\n       return a // b\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Use integer division to find the quotient of a divided by b\n    # The // operator performs division and rounds down to the nearest integer\n    return a // b\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the quotient of two numbers, rounded down to the nearest integer, using Python's integer division operator.",
