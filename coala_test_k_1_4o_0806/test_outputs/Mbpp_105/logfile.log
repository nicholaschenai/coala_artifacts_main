## Problem Restatement

We need to write a Python function that takes a list of boolean values and returns the count of `True` values in that list.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Initialize a counter to zero.
2. Iterate through each element in the list.
3. For each element, check if it is `True`.
4. If it is `True`, increment the counter by one.
5. After iterating through the list, return the counter value, which represents the number of `True` values in the list.

## Pseudocode

```
function count(boolean_list):
    initialize counter to 0
    for each element in boolean_list:
        if element is True:
            increment counter by 1
    return counter
```

## Final Python Solution

```python
def count(boolean_list):
    # Initialize a counter to keep track of True values
    true_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each element in the list
    for element in boolean_list:
        # Check if the element is True
        if element is True:
            # Increment the counter if the element is True
            true_count += 1
    
    # Return the total count of True values
    return true_count
```

        ## Problem Restatement

        We are given an array `A` of non-negative integers. For every contiguous subarray `B` of `A`, we compute the bitwise OR of all elements in `B`. We need to return the number of unique results obtained from these operations.

        ## Conceptual Solution

        1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number that has a bit set if either of the original numbers had that bit set. This means that as we extend a subarray, the result of the OR operation can only stay the same or increase.

        2. **Tracking Unique Results**: We need to track all unique results of the OR operations. Using a set is ideal for this purpose because it automatically handles duplicates.

        3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the OR for every possible subarray, we can use a dynamic approach:
           - Maintain a set of results from the previous iteration (`prev`).
           - For each new element in the array, calculate the OR with each element in `prev` and add the new element itself.
           - Update `prev` to include these new results.
           - Add all results from `prev` to a global set `results` to track all unique OR results.

        4. **Iterate Over the Array**: For each element in the array, update the `prev` set and the global `results` set.

        ## Pseudocode

        ```
        function subarrayBitwiseORs(A):
            initialize results as an empty set
            initialize prev as an empty set

            for each element x in A:
                initialize current as a set containing x
                for each element y in prev:
                    add (x OR y) to current
                update prev to be current
                add all elements of current to results

            return the size of results
        ```

        ## Final Python Solution

        ```python
        from typing import List

        class Solution:
            def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
                # Initialize a set to store all unique OR results
                results = set()
                # Initialize a set to store OR results of the previous iteration
                prev = set()
        
                # Iterate over each element in the array
                for x in A:
                    # Start a new set for the current element
                    current = {x}
                    # Update current with OR results from previous results
                    for y in prev:
                        current.add(x | y)
                    # Update prev to be the current set of results
                    prev = current
                    # Add all current results to the global results set
                    results.update(current)
        
                # Return the number of unique results
                return len(results)
        ```

        This solution efficiently calculates the number of unique bitwise OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to manage unique results.
