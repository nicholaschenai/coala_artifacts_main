For every contiguous subarray `B` of `A`, we compute the bitwise OR of all elements in `B`. We need to return the number of unique results obtained from these operations.\n\n        ## Conceptual Solution\n\n        1. **Understanding Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation between two numbers results in a number that has a bit set if either of the original numbers had that bit set. This means that as we extend a subarray, the result of the OR operation can only stay the same or increase.\n\n        2. **Tracking Unique Results**: We need to track all unique results of the OR operations. Using a set is ideal for this purpose because it automatically handles duplicates.\n\n        3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of recalculating the OR for every possible subarray, we can use a dynamic approach:\n           - Maintain a set of results from the previous iteration (`prev`).\n           - For each new element in the array, calculate the OR with each element in `prev` and add the new element itself.\n           - Update `prev` to include these new results.\n           - Add all results from `prev` to a global set `results` to track all unique OR results.\n\n        4. **Iterate Over the Array**: For each element in the array, update the `prev` set and the global `results` set.\n\n        ## Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function subarrayBitwiseORs(A):\n            initialize results as an empty set\n            initialize prev as an empty set\n\n            for each element x in A:\n                initialize current as a set containing x\n                for each element y in prev:\n                    add (x OR y) to current\n                update prev to be current\n                add all elements of current to results\n\n            return the size of results\n        ```\n\n        ## Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        from typing import List\n\n        class Solution:\n            def subarrayBitwiseORs(self, A: List[int]) -> int:\n                # Initialize a set to store all unique OR results\n                results = set()\n                # Initialize a set to store OR results of the previous iteration\n                prev = set()\n        \n                # Iterate over each element in the array\n                for x in A:\n                    # Start a new set for the current element\n                    current = {x}\n                    # Update current with OR results from previous results\n                    for y in prev:\n                        current.add(x | y)\n                    # Update prev to be the current set of results\n                    prev = current\n                    # Add all current results to the global results set\n                    results.update(current)\n        \n                # Return the number of unique results\n                return len(results)\n        ```\n\n        This solution efficiently calculates the number of unique bitwise OR results by leveraging the properties of the OR operation and using sets to manage unique results.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [[0]] Output: 1\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
