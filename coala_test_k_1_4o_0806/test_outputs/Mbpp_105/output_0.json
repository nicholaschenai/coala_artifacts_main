    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that counts the number of `True` values in a given list of boolean values.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and count how many times the value `True` appears. We can initialize a counter to zero and increment it each time we encounter a `True` value in the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function count(boolean_list):\n       initialize counter to 0\n       for each element in boolean_list:\n           if element is True:\n               increment counter by 1\n       return counter\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef count(boolean_list):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of True values\n    counter = 0\n    # Iterate over each element in the list\n    for element in boolean_list:\n        # Check if the current element is True\n        if element is True:\n            # Increment the counter if the element is True\n            counter += 1\n    # Return the total count of True values\n    return counter\n```",
