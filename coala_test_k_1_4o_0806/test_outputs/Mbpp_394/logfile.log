INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/394 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that checks if a given tuple contains any duplicate elements. If there are duplicates, the function should return `False`; otherwise, it should return `True`.

## Conceptual Solution

To determine if a tuple contains duplicates, we can use the property of sets in Python. A set is a collection that automatically removes duplicate elements. Therefore, if we convert the tuple to a set and the length of the set is the same as the length of the tuple, it means there are no duplicates. If the lengths differ, it means there were duplicates in the tuple.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `check_distinct` that takes a tuple as an argument.
2. Convert the tuple to a set.
3. Compare the length of the set with the length of the tuple.
4. If the lengths are equal, return `True` (no duplicates).
5. If the lengths are not equal, return `False` (duplicates exist).

## Final Python Solution

```python
def check_distinct(t: tuple) -> bool:
    # Convert the tuple to a set, which removes duplicates
    unique_elements = set(t)
    # Compare the length of the set with the length of the tuple
    # If they are equal, there are no duplicates
    return len(unique_elements) == len(t)
```

    ### Reflection on the Problem and Solution

    The problem involves determining if any three adjacent sides of a cube are painted the same color. The challenge lies in correctly identifying the sets of adjacent sides and checking their colors.

    ### Key Insights from the Official Solution

    1. **Adjacency Sets**: The official solution uses a list of tuples to represent all possible sets of three adjacent sides on a cube. This is a comprehensive approach that ensures all possible combinations are checked.

    2. **Indexing**: The solution uses 1-based indexing in the tuples, which is adjusted by subtracting 1 when accessing the list of colors. This is a small but crucial detail that ensures the correct sides are being compared.

    3. **Set for Uniqueness**: The use of a set to check if all three sides in a tuple have the same color is efficient. If the length of the set is 1, it means all three sides are the same color.

    4. **Early Exit**: The solution breaks out of the loop as soon as a matching set is found, which is efficient and reduces unnecessary checks.

    ### Why My Approach Failed

    My approach failed because I incorrectly identified the sets of adjacent sides. I assumed only four specific sets of sides, but the official solution considers all possible combinations of three adjacent sides. This oversight led to incorrect results for some test cases.

    ### Learning Points

    - **Comprehensive Checking**: When dealing with geometric problems, ensure all possible configurations are considered. The official solution's use of a list of tuples to represent all adjacency sets is a robust approach.

    - **Indexing**: Pay attention to indexing, especially when converting between 1-based and 0-based systems.

    - **Efficiency**: Using data structures like sets to check for uniqueness can simplify the logic and improve efficiency.

    This experience highlights the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem's geometric constraints and ensuring all possible configurations are considered in the solution.

   We need to write a function that checks if a given tuple contains any duplicate elements. If there are duplicates, the function should return `False`; otherwise, it should return `True`.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

   To determine if a tuple contains duplicates, we can convert the tuple into a set. A set automatically removes duplicate elements. If the length of the set is the same as the length of the tuple, it means there were no duplicates in the tuple. If the lengths differ, it means there were duplicates.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

   ```
   Define function check_distinct that takes a tuple as input
       Convert the tuple to a set
       Compare the length of the set with the length of the tuple
       If the lengths are the same, return True (no duplicates)
       Otherwise, return False (duplicates exist)
