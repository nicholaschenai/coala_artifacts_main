    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that checks if a given tuple contains any duplicate elements. If there are duplicates, the function should return `False`; otherwise, it should return `True`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To determine if a tuple contains duplicates, we can convert the tuple into a set. A set automatically removes duplicate elements. If the length of the set is the same as the length of the tuple, it means there were no duplicates in the tuple. If the lengths differ, it means there were duplicates.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function check_distinct that takes a tuple as input\n       Convert the tuple to a set\n       Compare the length of the set with the length of the tuple\n       If the lengths are the same, return True (no duplicates)\n       Otherwise, return False (duplicates exist)\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef check_distinct(t: tuple) -> bool:\n    # Convert the tuple to a set, which removes duplicates\n    unique_elements = set(t)\n    # Compare the length of the set with the length of the tuple\n    # If they are the same, it means there are no duplicates\n    return len(unique_elements) == len(t)\n```\n\nThis function will correctly determine if a tuple contains any duplicate elements by leveraging the properties of a set to remove duplicates and comparing the lengths of the original tuple and the set.",
