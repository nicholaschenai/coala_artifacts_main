    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within a given array of integers. A subarray is a sequence of consecutive elements from the array.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we need to consider both the maximum and minimum products at each position in the array. This is because a negative number can turn a small product into a large one when multiplied by another negative number. We will iterate through the array, keeping track of the maximum and minimum products up to the current position. At each step, we update these products based on the current number, and we also update the global maximum product found so far.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Initialize max_product to the first element of the array\n   Initialize current_max and current_min to the first element of the array\n\n   For each element num in the array starting from the second element:\n       If num is negative, swap current_max and current_min\n       Update current_max to be the maximum of num and current_max * num\n       Update current_min to be the minimum of num and current_min * num\n       Update max_product to be the maximum of max_product and current_max\n\n   Return max_product\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef max_subarray_product(arr):\n    # Initialize the maximum product to the first element\n    max_product = arr[0]\n    # Initialize current maximum and minimum products to the first element\n    current_max = arr[0]\n    current_min = arr[0]\n\n    # Iterate over the array starting from the second element\n    for num in arr[1:]:\n        # If the current number is negative, swap current_max and current_min\n        if num < 0:\n            current_max, current_min = current_min, current_max\n        \n        # Update current_max to be the maximum of the current number and the product of current_max and the current number\n        current_max = max(num, current_max * num)\n        # Update current_min to be the minimum of the current number and the product of current_min and the current number\n        current_min = min(num, current_min * num)\n        \n        # Update the global maximum product found so far\n        max_product = max(max_product, current_max)\n\n    return max_product\n```",
