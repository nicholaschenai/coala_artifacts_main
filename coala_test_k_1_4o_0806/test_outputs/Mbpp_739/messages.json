A triangular number is a number that can be represented in the form of a triangle with dots. The nth triangular number is given by the formula: \n\n\\[ T(n) = \\frac{n \\times (n + 1)}{2} \\]\n\nThe task is to find the smallest index `i` such that the triangular number `T(i)` has exactly `n` digits.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand Triangular Numbers**: Triangular numbers are generated by the formula \\( T(i) = \\frac{i \\times (i + 1)}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Determine Number of Digits**: The number of digits in a number `x` can be found using the formula `len(str(x))`.\n\n3. **Iterate to Find the Index**: Start from the first triangular number and keep calculating the next triangular number until you find one with exactly `n` digits.\n\n4. **Return the Index**: Once a triangular number with `n` digits is found, return its index.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Initialize `i` to 1.\n2. Loop indefinitely:\n   - Calculate the ith triangular number using the formula \\( T(i) = \\frac{i \\times (i + 1)}{2} \\).\n   - Convert the triangular number to a string and check its length.\n   - If the length of the string is equal to `n`, return `i`.\n   - Increment `i` by 1.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_Index(n: int) -> int:\n    # Start with the first index\n    i = 1\n    while True:\n        # Calculate the ith triangular number\n        triangular_number = (i * (i + 1)) // 2\n        # Check the number of digits in the triangular number\n        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:\n            # If it has n digits, return the index\n            return i\n        # Increment the index\n        i += 1\n```\n\nThis solution iteratively calculates triangular numbers and checks their digit length until it finds one with exactly `n` digits, then returns the corresponding index."

You can perform the following operations to transform `n` into `1`:\n\n        1. If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.\n        2. If `n` is odd, you can replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.\n\n        The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.\n\n        ### Conceptual Solution\n\n        To solve this problem, we need to minimize the number of operations to transform `n` into `1`. The strategy involves:\n\n        1. **Even Numbers**: If `n` is even, the optimal move is to divide it by 2, as this reduces the number significantly in one step.\n        2. **Odd Numbers**: If `n` is odd, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice depends on the resulting number:\n           - If `n + 1` is divisible by 4, incrementing might be better because it allows for a subsequent division by 2.\n           - If `n - 1` is divisible by 4, decrementing might be better for the same reason.\n           - Special case: If `n` is 3, decrementing to 2 is optimal because it directly leads to 1 in two steps.\n\n        ### Pseudocode\n\n        ```\n        function integerReplacement(n):\n            steps = 0\n            while n is not 1:\n                if n is even:\n                    n = n / 2\n                else:\n                    if n is 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                        n = n - 1\n                    else:\n                        n = n + 1\n                steps = steps + 1\n            return steps\n        ```\n\n        ### Final Python Solution\n\n        ```python\n        class Solution:\n            def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n                steps = 0\n                while n != 1:\n                    if n % 2 == 0:\n                        # If n is even, divide by 2\n                        n //= 2\n                    else:\n                        # If n is odd, decide whether to increment or decrement\n                        if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                            n -= 1\n                        else:\n                            n += 1\n                    steps += 1\n                return steps\n        ```\n\n        ### Explanation of the Code\n\n        - We initialize a counter `steps` to track the number of operations.\n        - We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.\n        - If `n` is even, we divide it by 2.\n        - If `n` is odd, we check if decrementing or incrementing is more beneficial:\n          - If `n` is 3 or `(n - 1) % 4 == 0`, we decrement `n`.\n          - Otherwise, we increment `n`.\n        - We increment the `steps` counter after each operation.\n        - Finally, we return the total number of steps taken to reduce `n` to `1`.\n    [/Thought Process and Code]\n\n    [Environment Feedback]:\n        Note: Inputs/outputs here are automatically extracted/truncated so formatting may be a bit off.\n        Tests passed:\n\n         Input: [8] Output: 3\n\n        Tests failed:\n        None\n    [/Environment Feedback]\n\n    [Result]:\n        Success\n    [/Result]\n\n[/Past Memory]\n\n"
