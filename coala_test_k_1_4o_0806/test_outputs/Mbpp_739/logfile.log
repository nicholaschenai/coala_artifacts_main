INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/739 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits. A triangular number is a number that can be represented in the form of a triangle with dots. The nth triangular number is given by the formula: 

\[ T(n) = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]

The task is to find the smallest index `i` such that the triangular number `T(i)` has exactly `n` digits.

## Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand Triangular Numbers**: Triangular numbers are generated by the formula \( T(i) = \frac{i \times (i + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Determine Number of Digits**: The number of digits in a number `x` can be found using the formula `len(str(x))`.

3. **Iterate to Find the Index**: Start from the first triangular number and keep calculating the next triangular number until you find one with exactly `n` digits.

4. **Return the Index**: Once a triangular number with `n` digits is found, return its index.

## Pseudocode

1. Initialize `i` to 1.
2. Loop indefinitely:
   - Calculate the ith triangular number using the formula \( T(i) = \frac{i \times (i + 1)}{2} \).
   - Convert the triangular number to a string and check its length.
   - If the length of the string is equal to `n`, return `i`.
   - Increment `i` by 1.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def find_Index(n: int) -> int:
    # Start with the first index
    i = 1
    while True:
        # Calculate the ith triangular number
        triangular_number = (i * (i + 1)) // 2
        # Check the number of digits in the triangular number
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            # If it has n digits, return the index
            return i
        # Increment the index
        i += 1
```

This solution iteratively calculates triangular numbers and checks their digit length until it finds one with exactly `n` digits, then returns the corresponding index.

        ### Problem Restatement

        You are given a positive integer `n`. You can perform the following operations to transform `n` into `1`:

        1. If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n/2`.
        2. If `n` is odd, you can replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

        The task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `1`.

        ### Conceptual Solution

        To solve this problem, we need to minimize the number of operations to transform `n` into `1`. The strategy involves:

        1. **Even Numbers**: If `n` is even, the optimal move is to divide it by 2, as this reduces the number significantly in one step.
        2. **Odd Numbers**: If `n` is odd, we have two choices: increment or decrement. The choice depends on the resulting number:
           - If `n + 1` is divisible by 4, incrementing might be better because it allows for a subsequent division by 2.
           - If `n - 1` is divisible by 4, decrementing might be better for the same reason.
           - Special case: If `n` is 3, decrementing to 2 is optimal because it directly leads to 1 in two steps.

        ### Pseudocode

        ```
        function integerReplacement(n):
            steps = 0
            while n is not 1:
                if n is even:
                    n = n / 2
                else:
                    if n is 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                        n = n - 1
                    else:
                        n = n + 1
                steps = steps + 1
            return steps
        ```

        ### Final Python Solution

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:
                steps = 0
                while n != 1:
                    if n % 2 == 0:
                        # If n is even, divide by 2
                        n //= 2
                    else:
                        # If n is odd, decide whether to increment or decrement
                        if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                            n -= 1
                        else:
                            n += 1
                    steps += 1
                return steps
        ```

        ### Explanation of the Code

        - We initialize a counter `steps` to track the number of operations.
        - We use a loop to repeatedly transform `n` until it becomes `1`.
        - If `n` is even, we divide it by 2.
        - If `n` is odd, we check if decrementing or incrementing is more beneficial:
          - If `n` is 3 or `(n - 1) % 4 == 0`, we decrement `n`.
          - Otherwise, we increment `n`.
        - We increment the `steps` counter after each operation.
        - Finally, we return the total number of steps taken to reduce `n` to `1`.
