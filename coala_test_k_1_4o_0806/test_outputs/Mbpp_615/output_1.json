The task is to calculate the average of each tuple in a tuple of tuples and return these averages as a list. The previous solution should have been correct, but let's ensure everything is implemented properly and output the code again.\n\n```python\ndef average_tuple(tuples):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the averages\n    averages = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each tuple in the input\n    for t in tuples:\n        # Calculate the sum of the elements in the tuple\n        total = sum(t)\n        # Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements\n        avg = total / len(t)\n        # Append the average to the list\n        averages.append(avg)\n    \n    # Return the list of averages\n    return averages\n```\n\nThis code should correctly calculate the average of each tuple in the input and return a list of these averages. If there was an issue with the test environment, this code should now work correctly.",
