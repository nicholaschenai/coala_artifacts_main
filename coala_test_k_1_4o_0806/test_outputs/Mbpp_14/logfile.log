INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/14 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

We need to write a function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The function will take three parameters: the base of the triangle, the height of the triangle, and the length of the prism. The function should return the volume of the prism.

### Conceptual Solution

1. **Understand the formula for the volume of a triangular prism**: 
   - The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length}
     \]
   - The base area of the triangular face is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
     \]
   - Therefore, the volume of the prism is:
     \[
     V = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}\right) \times \text{Length}
     \]

2. **Plan the function**:
   - The function will take three arguments: `base`, `height`, and `length`.
   - Calculate the base area using the formula for the area of a triangle.
   - Multiply the base area by the length to get the volume.
   - Return the calculated volume.

### Pseudocode

```
function find_Volume(base, height, length):
    base_area = (1/2) * base * height
    volume = base_area * length
    return volume
```

### Final Python Solution

```python
def find_Volume(base: float, height: float, length: float) -> float:
    # Calculate the area of the triangular base
    base_area = 0.5 * base * height
    # Calculate the volume of the triangular prism
    volume = base_area * length
    # Return the calculated volume
    return volume
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), the core concepts involved understanding the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \( a \) and \( b \) given these constraints.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).
    - **Area Formula**: The area \( S \) is given by \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \).

    ### Strategy:
    - **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \( a \).
    - **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.
    - **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.
    - **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.
    - **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    import sys
    import math

    def find_triangle_sides():
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            H = int(data[index])
            S = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            if 2 * S > H * H:
                results.append("-1")
                continue
        
            try:
                discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S
                if discriminant < 0:
                    results.append("-1")
                    continue
            
                a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
                a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
            
                b1 = 2 * S / a1
                b2 = 2 * S / a2
            
                if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:
                    results.append(f"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:
                    results.append(f"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                else:
                    results.append("-1")
            except ValueError:
                results.append("-1")
    
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")
