    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a Python function that calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The function should take three parameters: the base of the triangle, the height of the triangle, and the length of the prism. The function should return the volume of the prism.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To find the volume of a triangular prism, we first need to calculate the area of the triangular base. The area of a triangle is given by the formula: \n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n   \\]\n   Once we have the area of the base, we can find the volume of the prism by multiplying the area of the base by the length of the prism:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = \\text{Area of base} \\times \\text{length}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function find_Volume(base, height, length):\n       calculate the area of the triangular base using (1/2) * base * height\n       calculate the volume by multiplying the area by the length\n       return the volume\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_Volume(base: float, height: float, length: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the area of the triangular base\n    area_of_base = 0.5 * base * height\n    # Calculate the volume of the triangular prism\n    volume = area_of_base * length\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```\n\nThis function calculates the volume of a triangular prism by first determining the area of its triangular base and then multiplying that area by the length of the prism.",
