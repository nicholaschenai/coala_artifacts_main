The function will take three parameters: the base of the triangle, the height of the triangle, and the length of the prism. The function should return the volume of the prism.\n\n### Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understand the formula for the volume of a triangular prism**: \n   - The volume \\( V \\) of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:\n     \\[\n     V = \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Length}\n     \\]\n   - The base area of the triangular face is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Base Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the volume of the prism is:\n     \\[\n     V = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Base} \\times \\text{Height}\\right) \\times \\text{Length}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Plan the function**:\n   - The function will take three arguments: `base`, `height`, and `length`.\n   - Calculate the base area using the formula for the area of a triangle.\n   - Multiply the base area by the length to get the volume.\n   - Return the calculated volume.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_Volume(base, height, length):\n    base_area = (1/2) * base * height\n    volume = base_area * length\n    return volume\n```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_Volume(base: float, height: float, length: float) -> float:\n    # Calculate the area of the triangular base\n    base_area = 0.5 * base * height\n    # Calculate the volume of the triangular prism\n    volume = base_area * length\n    # Return the calculated volume\n    return volume\n```"

The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) given these constraints.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \\( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \\).\n    - **Area Formula**: The area \\( S \\) is given by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b = S \\).\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \\( b = \\frac{2S}{a} \\) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \\( a \\).\n    - **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.\n    - **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.\n    - **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.\n    - **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    import math\n\n    def find_triangle_sides():\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            H = int(data[index])\n            S = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            if 2 * S > H * H:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n                continue\n        \n            try:\n                discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S\n                if discriminant < 0:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                    continue\n            \n                a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n                a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n            \n                b1 = 2 * S / a1\n                b2 = 2 * S / a2\n            \n                if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n            except ValueError:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n    \n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    find_triangle_sides()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation and precision handling in computational geometry problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
