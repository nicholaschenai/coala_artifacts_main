INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/86 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the nth centered hexagonal number. A centered hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center in a hexagonal pattern. The task is to find the value of the nth centered hexagonal number.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Centered hexagonal numbers can be calculated using a specific formula. The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the formula: \(3n(n-1) + 1\). This formula arises from the pattern of how dots are added to form the hexagonal shape. We will use this formula to compute the nth centered hexagonal number.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `centered_hexagonal_number` that takes an integer `n` as input.
   - Use the formula \(3n(n-1) + 1\) to calculate the nth centered hexagonal number.
   - Return the result.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def centered_hexagonal_number(n: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula
    # Centered hexagonal number formula: 3n(n-1) + 1
    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1
```

This function will correctly compute the nth centered hexagonal number using the given formula.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, I needed to find the N'th term in a specific series for multiple test cases. The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.

    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:
    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.
    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.

    ### Strategy:
    - I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.
    - This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).

    ### Implementation:
    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.
    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.

    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.
