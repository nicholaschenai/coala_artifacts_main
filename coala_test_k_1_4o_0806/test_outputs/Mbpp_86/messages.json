A centered hexagonal number is a figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center in a hexagonal pattern. The task is to find the value of the nth centered hexagonal number.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Centered hexagonal numbers can be calculated using a specific formula. The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the formula: \\(3n(n-1) + 1\\). This formula arises from the pattern of how dots are added to form the hexagonal shape. We will use this formula to compute the nth centered hexagonal number.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function `centered_hexagonal_number` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n   - Use the formula \\(3n(n-1) + 1\\) to calculate the nth centered hexagonal number.\n   - Return the result.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula\n    # Centered hexagonal number formula: 3n(n-1) + 1\n    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute the nth centered hexagonal number using the given formula."

The series was defined as: 0, 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ..., and the task was to identify the pattern and compute the N'th term efficiently.\n\n    ### Key Concepts and Patterns:\n    - The differences between consecutive terms in the series are perfect squares: 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, etc.\n    - The N'th term can be calculated using the sum of squares formula: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - I used the sum of squares formula to compute the N'th term directly, which is efficient and avoids the need to iterate through the series.\n    - This approach is optimal given the constraints, as it allows for quick computation even for large values of N (up to 10,000).\n\n    ### Implementation:\n    - I implemented a function `calculate_nth_term(N)` to compute the N'th term using the formula.\n    - The main function reads input, processes each test case, and outputs the result.\n\n    This problem reinforced the importance of recognizing mathematical patterns and using known formulas to solve series-related problems efficiently. The solution was straightforward once the pattern was identified, and the implementation was successful on the first attempt.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
