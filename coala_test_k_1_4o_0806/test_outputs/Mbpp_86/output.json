    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the nth centered hexagonal number. The centered hexagonal numbers are a sequence of numbers that represent a hexagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center dot in a hexagonal pattern. The task is to find the nth number in this sequence.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   Centered hexagonal numbers can be calculated using a specific formula. The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the formula: `3n(n-1) + 1`. This formula arises from the geometric arrangement of the hexagonal pattern. We can use this formula to directly compute the nth centered hexagonal number without iterating through the sequence.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define function centered_hexagonal_number(n):\n       Calculate the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula: 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n       Return the result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula\n    # The formula is derived from the geometric pattern of centered hexagons\n    # Formula: 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n```",
