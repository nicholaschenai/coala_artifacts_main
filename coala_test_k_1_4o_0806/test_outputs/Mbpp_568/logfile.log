INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/568 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function named `empty_list` that takes an integer `N` as input and returns a list containing `N` empty dictionaries.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - To solve this problem, we will create a list that contains `N` empty dictionaries. An empty dictionary in Python is represented by `{}`. We can use a list comprehension to generate a list of `N` such empty dictionaries.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `empty_list` that takes an integer `N` as an argument.
   - Use a list comprehension to create a list with `N` empty dictionaries.
   - Return the list.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def empty_list(N: int) -> list:
    # Create a list with N empty dictionaries using list comprehension
    return [{} for _ in range(N)]
```

This function will generate a list of `N` empty dictionaries by iterating `N` times and appending an empty dictionary `{}` to the list in each iteration. The use of `_` in the list comprehension indicates that the loop variable is not used in the body of the loop.

[Summary]:
    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    #### Core Concepts and Patterns

    The problem involves generating valid schedules for a sequence of days, where each day features a different dish from a set of four options. The constraints are that consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last days must also differ. The challenge is to compute the number of such valid schedules efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \( N \) (up to \( 10^9 \)).

    #### Strategies and Errors

    1. **Initial Approach**: The initial approach used a formula \( 4 \times 3^{(N-1)} \), which incorrectly assumed that the last day had 3 choices. This led to incorrect results for \( N > 2 \).

    2. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula is \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \). This accounts for:
       - 4 choices for the first day.
       - \( 3^{(N-2)} \) choices for the intermediate days.
       - 2 choices for the last day, ensuring it differs from both the previous day and the first day.

    3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using Python's `pow` function with three arguments allows efficient computation of large powers under a modulus, which is crucial for handling large \( N \).

    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes

    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by adding a call to `main()` within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
    - **Formula Miscalculation**: The initial miscalculation of the formula was corrected by re-evaluating the constraints and adjusting the formula to \( 4 \times 3^{(N-2)} \times 2 \).

    ### Final Correct Code

    ```python
    def calculate_schedules(N):
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        if N == 2:
            return (4 * 3) % MOD
        else:
            # Using modular exponentiation to compute 3^(N-2) % MOD
            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)
            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD

    def main():
        import sys
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        results = []
    
        for i in range(1, T + 1):
            N = int(data[i])
            result = calculate_schedules(N)
            results.append(result)
    
        for result in results:
            print(result)

    # Call the main function to execute the program
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering problem constraints and verifying the logic of mathematical formulas used in algorithmic solutions.
