The constraints are that consecutive days must have different dishes, and the first and last days must also differ. The challenge is to compute the number of such valid schedules efficiently, especially given the large possible value of \\( N \\) (up to \\( 10^9 \\)).\n\n    #### Strategies and Errors\n\n    1. **Initial Approach**: The initial approach used a formula \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-1)} \\), which incorrectly assumed that the last day had 3 choices. This led to incorrect results for \\( N > 2 \\).\n\n    2. **Correct Formula**: The correct formula is \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\). This accounts for:\n       - 4 choices for the first day.\n       - \\( 3^{(N-2)} \\) choices for the intermediate days.\n       - 2 choices for the last day, ensuring it differs from both the previous day and the first day.\n\n    3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Using Python's `pow` function with three arguments allows efficient computation of large powers under a modulus, which is crucial for handling large \\( N \\).\n\n    #### Unexpected Errors and Fixes\n\n    - **Function Execution**: Initially, the `main()` function was not called, leading to no output. This was fixed by adding a call to `main()` within the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block.\n    - **Formula Miscalculation**: The initial miscalculation of the formula was corrected by re-evaluating the constraints and adjusting the formula to \\( 4 \\times 3^{(N-2)} \\times 2 \\).\n\n    ### Final Correct Code\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_schedules(N):\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        if N == 2:\n            return (4 * 3) % MOD\n        else:\n            # Using modular exponentiation to compute 3^(N-2) % MOD\n            power = pow(3, N-2, MOD)\n            return (4 * power * 2) % MOD\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        results = []\n    \n        for i in range(1, T + 1):\n            N = int(data[i])\n            result = calculate_schedules(N)\n            results.append(result)\n    \n        for result in results:\n            print(result)\n\n    # Call the main function to execute the program\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of carefully considering problem constraints and verifying the logic of mathematical formulas used in algorithmic solutions.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
