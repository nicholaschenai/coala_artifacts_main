    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the result of raising a number `a` to the power of another number `b`. This is equivalent to multiplying `a` by itself `b` times.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We start with a result of 1 and multiply it by `a` repeatedly, `b` times. This will give us `a` raised to the power of `b`. This approach is straightforward and works well for small values of `b`.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function power(a, b):\n       result = 1\n       for i from 1 to b:\n           result = result * a\n       return result\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef power(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    # Initialize the result to 1, as any number to the power of 0 is 1\n    result = 1\n    # Multiply result by 'a', 'b' times\n    for _ in range(b):\n        result *= a\n    # Return the final result which is a^b\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function will correctly compute `a` raised to the power of `b` by iteratively multiplying `a` with itself `b` times.",
