If the radius is negative, the function should return `None`.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: \n   - A semicircle is half of a circle. The largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle with its hypotenuse as the diameter of the semicircle.\n   - The diameter of the semicircle is twice the radius (`2 * radius`).\n\n2. **Triangle Properties**:\n   - For a right triangle inscribed in a semicircle, the hypotenuse is the diameter of the semicircle.\n   - The maximum area of such a triangle is achieved when the triangle is isosceles, meaning the two legs are equal in length.\n\n3. **Area Calculation**:\n   - The area of a triangle is given by the formula: \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\).\n   - For the largest inscribed triangle, the base and height are both equal to the radius of the semicircle.\n   - Therefore, the area of the largest triangle is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{radius} \\times \\text{radius} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{radius}^2 \\).\n\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**:\n   - If the radius is negative, the function should return `None` because a negative radius does not make sense in this context.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction triangle_area(radius):\n    if radius is negative:\n        return None\n    else:\n        calculate area as (1/2) * radius * radius\n        return the calculated area\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef triangle_area(radius: float) -> float:\n    # If the radius is negative, return None\n    if radius < 0:\n        return None\n    # Calculate the area of the largest inscribed triangle\n    # Area = (1/2) * radius * radius\n    area = 0.5 * radius * radius\n    return area\n```"

The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) given these constraints.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \\( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \\).\n    - **Area Formula**: The area \\( S \\) is given by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times b = S \\).\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \\( b = \\frac{2S}{a} \\) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \\( a \\).\n    - **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.\n    - **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n    ### Challenges and Fixes:\n    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.\n    - **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.\n    - **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    import math\n\n    def find_triangle_sides():\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n    \n        T = int(data[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n    \n        for _ in range(T):\n            H = int(data[index])\n            S = int(data[index + 1])\n            index += 2\n        \n            if 2 * S > H * H:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n                continue\n        \n            try:\n                discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S\n                if discriminant < 0:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n                    continue\n            \n                a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n                a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)\n            \n                b1 = 2 * S / a1\n                b2 = 2 * S / a2\n            \n                if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:\n                    results.append(f\"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}\")\n                else:\n                    results.append(\"-1\")\n            except ValueError:\n                results.append(\"-1\")\n    \n        sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\".join(results) + \"\\n\")\n\n    find_triangle_sides()\n    ```\n\n    This experience reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation and precision handling in computational geometry problems.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
