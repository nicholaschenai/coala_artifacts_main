    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with the numbers sorted in ascending order. The function should be named `comb_sort`.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution first in plain English:**\n\n   We will implement the Comb Sort algorithm, which is an improvement over the Bubble Sort. The key idea is to eliminate turtles, or small values near the end of the list, by using a larger gap between compared elements. The gap starts as the length of the list and shrinks by a shrink factor (commonly 1.3) until it becomes 1, at which point the algorithm behaves like a Bubble Sort. During each pass, if any swaps are made, the list is not yet sorted, and we continue the process.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function comb_sort(arr):\n       set gap to length of arr\n       set shrink factor to 1.3\n       set sorted to False\n       \n       while gap > 1 or sorted is False:\n           update gap by dividing it by shrink factor and taking the floor\n           if gap is less than 1, set it to 1\n           \n           set sorted to True\n           \n           for i from 0 to length of arr - gap:\n               if arr[i] > arr[i + gap]:\n                   swap arr[i] and arr[i + gap]\n                   set sorted to False\n                   \n       return arr\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef comb_sort(arr):\n    # Initialize the gap to the length of the array\n    gap = len(arr)\n    # Define the shrink factor\n    shrink = 1.3\n    # Initialize the sorted flag to False\n    sorted = False\n    \n    # Continue the loop until the gap is 1 and the array is sorted\n    while gap > 1 or not sorted:\n        # Update the gap for the next comb\n        gap = int(gap // shrink)\n        # Ensure the gap is at least 1\n        if gap < 1:\n            gap = 1\n        \n        # Assume the array is sorted\n        sorted = True\n        \n        # Compare all elements with the current gap\n        for i in range(len(arr) - gap):\n            # If the current element is greater than the element at the gap distance\n            if arr[i] > arr[i + gap]:\n                # Swap the elements\n                arr[i], arr[i + gap] = arr[i + gap], arr[i]\n                # Since we made a swap, the array might not be sorted\n                sorted = False\n    \n    # Return the sorted array\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis code implements the Comb Sort algorithm, which efficiently sorts the list by reducing the gap between compared elements and performing swaps as necessary.",
