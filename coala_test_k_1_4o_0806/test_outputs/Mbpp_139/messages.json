The function should return a floating-point number that is close to the expected value when the radius is 10.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula: \\( C = 2 \\times \\pi \\times r \\), where \\( C \\) is the circumference and \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle. We will use the value of \\( \\pi \\) as 3.14159 for our calculations.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   - Define a function named `circle_circumference` that takes one parameter `radius`.\n   - Inside the function, set the value of \\( \\pi \\) to 3.14159.\n   - Calculate the circumference using the formula \\( C = 2 \\times \\pi \\times \\text{radius} \\).\n   - Return the calculated circumference.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef circle_circumference(radius: float) -> float:\n    # Define the value of pi\n    pi = 3.14159\n    # Calculate the circumference using the formula C = 2 * pi * radius\n    circumference = 2 * pi * radius\n    # Return the calculated circumference\n    return circumference\n```\n\nThis function will compute the circumference of a circle using the given radius and the constant value of \\( \\pi \\)."

        "content": "\nAlso, here are some of your memories.\nFeel free to use the given information to aid your problem solving process if necessary.\nDo not confuse the memories with the problem statement.\n\n## Memories\n\n[Summary]:\n    In this problem, the task was to convert a number into a specified base, with the default being \u03c0. The challenge was to handle both integer and fractional parts of the number and return the result as a string. The function needed to accommodate non-integer bases, which added complexity to the conversion process.\n\n    ### Core Concepts:\n    - **Base Conversion**: The problem required converting numbers to bases that could be non-integer, such as \u03c0. This involves handling both integer and fractional parts separately.\n    - **Handling Non-Integer Bases**: Unlike typical base conversions, non-integer bases require careful handling of division and modulus operations.\n\n    ### Strategies and Challenges:\n    - **Integer Part Conversion**: Initially, the conversion logic for the integer part was not correctly handling non-integer bases. The use of integer division and modulus operations needed to be adapted for non-integer bases.\n    - **Fractional Part Conversion**: Multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting digits worked well, but ensuring precision with the specified number of decimal places was crucial.\n\n    ### Errors and Fixes:\n    - **Incorrect Integer Conversion**: The main issue was with the integer part conversion when using non-integer bases. Adjusting the logic to correctly handle division and modulus operations for non-integer bases was key.\n    - **Zero Handling**: Ensuring that the integer part is represented as '0' when necessary was a simple but important fix.\n\n    ### Final Solution:\n    The final solution involved correctly adapting the conversion logic for non-integer bases and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts were handled accurately. The function now correctly converts numbers to the specified base, including non-integer bases like \u03c0, and formats the result as expected.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
