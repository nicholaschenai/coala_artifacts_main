INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/139 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that calculates the circumference of a circle given its radius. The function should return a floating-point number that is close to the expected value when the radius is 10.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The circumference of a circle can be calculated using the formula: \( C = 2 \times \pi \times r \), where \( C \) is the circumference and \( r \) is the radius of the circle. We will use the value of \( \pi \) as 3.14159 for our calculations.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `circle_circumference` that takes one parameter `radius`.
   - Inside the function, set the value of \( \pi \) to 3.14159.
   - Calculate the circumference using the formula \( C = 2 \times \pi \times \text{radius} \).
   - Return the calculated circumference.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def circle_circumference(radius: float) -> float:
    # Define the value of pi
    pi = 3.14159
    # Calculate the circumference using the formula C = 2 * pi * radius
    circumference = 2 * pi * radius
    # Return the calculated circumference
    return circumference
```

This function will compute the circumference of a circle using the given radius and the constant value of \( \pi \).

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the task was to convert a number into a specified base, with the default being Ï€. The challenge was to handle both integer and fractional parts of the number and return the result as a string. The function needed to accommodate non-integer bases, which added complexity to the conversion process.

    ### Core Concepts:
    - **Base Conversion**: The problem required converting numbers to bases that could be non-integer, such as Ï€. This involves handling both integer and fractional parts separately.
    - **Handling Non-Integer Bases**: Unlike typical base conversions, non-integer bases require careful handling of division and modulus operations.

    ### Strategies and Challenges:
    - **Integer Part Conversion**: Initially, the conversion logic for the integer part was not correctly handling non-integer bases. The use of integer division and modulus operations needed to be adapted for non-integer bases.
    - **Fractional Part Conversion**: Multiplying the fractional part by the base and extracting digits worked well, but ensuring precision with the specified number of decimal places was crucial.

    ### Errors and Fixes:
    - **Incorrect Integer Conversion**: The main issue was with the integer part conversion when using non-integer bases. Adjusting the logic to correctly handle division and modulus operations for non-integer bases was key.
    - **Zero Handling**: Ensuring that the integer part is represented as '0' when necessary was a simple but important fix.

    ### Final Solution:
    The final solution involved correctly adapting the conversion logic for non-integer bases and ensuring that both integer and fractional parts were handled accurately. The function now correctly converts numbers to the specified base, including non-integer bases like Ï€, and formats the result as expected.
