    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a string and replaces all spaces with underscores and all underscores with spaces.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string. For each character:\n   - If the character is a space, replace it with an underscore.\n   - If the character is an underscore, replace it with a space.\n   - If the character is neither, keep it unchanged.\n   Finally, we will join all the characters back into a single string and return it.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function replace_spaces(s):\n       Initialize an empty list to store the modified characters\n       \n       for each character in s:\n           if character is a space:\n               append an underscore to the list\n           else if character is an underscore:\n               append a space to the list\n           else:\n               append the character itself to the list\n       \n       Join the list into a string and return it\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef replace_spaces(s: str) -> str:\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the modified characters\n    modified_chars = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        if char == ' ':\n            # If the character is a space, replace it with an underscore\n            modified_chars.append('_')\n        elif char == '_':\n            # If the character is an underscore, replace it with a space\n            modified_chars.append(' ')\n        else:\n            # If the character is neither, keep it unchanged\n            modified_chars.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return it\n    return ''.join(modified_chars)\n```",
