    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that counts how many times a specific number appears in a given list of numbers.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we will iterate through the list and count how many times the specified number appears. We will initialize a counter to zero and increment it each time we find the number in the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   Define a function named frequency that takes a list and a number as arguments.\n   Initialize a counter to zero.\n   For each element in the list:\n       If the element is equal to the number:\n           Increment the counter by one.\n   Return the counter.\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef frequency(lst, num):\n    # Initialize a counter to keep track of occurrences\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate through each element in the list\n    for element in lst:\n        # If the current element matches the number we're looking for\n        if element == num:\n            # Increment the counter\n            count += 1\n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count\n```",
