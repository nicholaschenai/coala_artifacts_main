INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/788 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to write a function that takes a list of strings and a single string as inputs. The function should return a new tuple that contains all the elements of the list followed by the string.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The solution involves combining the elements of the list with the string into a single tuple. We can achieve this by converting the list into a tuple and then concatenating it with a tuple containing the single string.

3. **Pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `new_tuple` that takes two parameters: a list and a string.
   - Convert the list into a tuple.
   - Create a tuple from the string.
   - Concatenate the two tuples.
   - Return the resulting tuple.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def new_tuple(lst: list, s: str) -> tuple:
    # Convert the list to a tuple
    list_as_tuple = tuple(lst)
    
    # Create a tuple from the string
    string_as_tuple = (s,)
    
    # Concatenate the two tuples
    result_tuple = list_as_tuple + string_as_tuple
    
    # Return the resulting tuple
    return result_tuple

[Past Memory]:

    [Task]:
        Given an encoded string, return it's decoded string.


        The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.


        You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

        Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].


        Examples:

        s = "3[a]2[bc]", return "aaabcbc".
        s = "3[a2[c]]", return "accaccacc".
        s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef", return "abcabccdcdcdef".

    [/Previous Critique]

    [Thought Process and Code]:
        1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**

           We are given a string that is encoded using a specific pattern. The pattern involves numbers followed by square brackets containing a substring. The number indicates how many times the substring inside the brackets should be repeated. Our task is to decode this string by expanding all such patterns and returning the fully decoded string.

        2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**

           To decode the string, we can use a stack to keep track of the current state as we parse through the string. We will iterate over each character in the string:
           - If we encounter a digit, we will determine the full number (which could be more than one digit) and push it onto the stack.
           - If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, it indicates the start of a new encoded substring, so we push the current state (current string and repeat count) onto the stack.
           - If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, it means we have reached the end of an encoded substring. We pop the last state from the stack, repeat the substring the specified number of times, and append it to the previous string.
           - If we encounter a letter, we simply append it to the current string being built.

        3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**

           ```
           function decodeString(s):
               Initialize a stack to keep track of strings and repeat counts
               Initialize current_string as an empty string
               Initialize current_num as 0

               for each character in s:
                   if character is a digit:
                       Update current_num to include this digit
                   else if character is '[':
                       Push (current_string, current_num) onto the stack
                       Reset current_string to empty and current_num to 0
                   else if character is ']':
                       Pop (prev_string, repeat_count) from the stack
                       Update current_string to prev_string + (current_string repeated repeat_count times)
                   else:
                       Append character to current_string

               return current_string
           ```

        4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

        ```python
        class Solution:
            def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
                # Initialize a stack to keep track of previous strings and repeat counts
                stack = []
                current_string = ""
                current_num = 0

                # Iterate over each character in the input string
                for char in s:
                    if char.isdigit():
                        # If the character is a digit, update the current number
                        current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)
                    elif char == '[':
                        # If the character is '[', push the current state onto the stack
                        stack.append((current_string, current_num))
                        # Reset current_string and current_num for the new context
                        current_string = ""
                        current_num = 0
                    elif char == ']':
                        # If the character is ']', pop the last state from the stack
                        prev_string, repeat_count = stack.pop()
                        # Repeat the current_string and append it to the previous string
                        current_string = prev_string + current_string * repeat_count
                    else:
                        # If the character is a letter, append it to the current string
                        current_string += char

                # Return the fully decoded string
                return current_string
        ```

        This solution uses a stack to manage nested structures and handles multiple digits for repeat counts, ensuring the correct decoding of the input string.
