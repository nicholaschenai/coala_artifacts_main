INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/17 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   - We need to create a function that calculates the perimeter of a square. The function will take the length of one side of the square as input and return the perimeter.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - The perimeter of a square is calculated by adding up the lengths of all four sides. Since all sides of a square are equal, the perimeter can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function named `square_perimeter` that takes one parameter `side_length`.
   - Calculate the perimeter by multiplying `side_length` by 4.
   - Return the calculated perimeter.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
# Define the function to calculate the perimeter of a square
def square_perimeter(side_length: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 4
    perimeter = 4 * side_length
    # Return the calculated perimeter
    return perimeter
```

This function will correctly compute the perimeter of a square given the length of one of its sides.

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In tackling the problem of finding a right-angled triangle with a given hypotenuse \( H \) and area \( S \), the core concepts involved understanding the Pythagorean theorem and the formula for the area of a triangle. The challenge was to derive a mathematical solution that could efficiently determine the side lengths \( a \) and \( b \) given these constraints.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Pythagorean Theorem**: For a right-angled triangle, \( a^2 + b^2 = H^2 \).
    - **Area Formula**: The area \( S \) is given by \( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b = S \).

    ### Strategy:
    - **Quadratic Equation**: By substituting \( b = \frac{2S}{a} \) into the Pythagorean theorem, we derived a quadratic equation to solve for \( a \).
    - **Discriminant Check**: Ensured the discriminant of the quadratic equation was non-negative to avoid math errors.
    - **Precision Handling**: Used a small tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic when checking if the calculated sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

    ### Challenges and Fixes:
    - **Input/Output Handling**: Initially, the function was not executed, leading to no output. This was fixed by ensuring the function was called.
    - **Mathematical Errors**: Ensured the discriminant was checked for non-negativity to prevent invalid square root operations.
    - **Output Formatting**: Ensured the output was formatted to five decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    import sys
    import math

    def find_triangle_sides():
        input = sys.stdin.read
        data = input().split()
    
        T = int(data[0])
        index = 1
        results = []
    
        for _ in range(T):
            H = int(data[index])
            S = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
        
            if 2 * S > H * H:
                results.append("-1")
                continue
        
            try:
                discriminant = H * H * H * H - 16 * S * S
                if discriminant < 0:
                    results.append("-1")
                    continue
            
                a1 = math.sqrt((H * H + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
                a2 = math.sqrt((H * H - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2)
            
                b1 = 2 * S / a1
                b2 = 2 * S / a2
            
                if a1 > 0 and b1 > 0 and abs(a1 * a1 + b1 * b1 - H * H) < 0.01:
                    results.append(f"{min(a1, b1):.5f} {max(a1, b1):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                elif a2 > 0 and b2 > 0 and abs(a2 * a2 + b2 * b2 - H * H) < 0.01:
                    results.append(f"{min(a2, b2):.5f} {max(a2, b2):.5f} {H:.5f}")
                else:
                    results.append("-1")
            except ValueError:
                results.append("-1")
    
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(results) + "\n")

    find_triangle_sides()
    ```

    This experience reinforced the importance of careful mathematical derivation and precision handling in computational geometry problems.
