    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to write a function that calculates the perimeter of a square. The function will take the length of one side of the square as input and return the perimeter.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   The perimeter of a square is calculated by adding up the lengths of all four sides. Since all sides of a square are equal, the perimeter can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 4. Therefore, the function will take the side length as input, multiply it by 4, and return the result.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   ```\n   function square_perimeter(side_length):\n       return 4 * side_length\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef square_perimeter(side_length: int) -> int:\n    # Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the side length by 4\n    return 4 * side_length\n```\n\nThis function takes an integer `side_length` as input and returns the perimeter of the square by multiplying the side length by 4.",
