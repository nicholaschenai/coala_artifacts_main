INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/280 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that checks if a given element is present in a list. If the element is found, the function should return a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it should return a tuple with `False` and `-1`.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - Iterate through the list using a loop.
   - For each element in the list, check if it matches the target element.
   - If a match is found, return `True` and the current index.
   - If the loop completes without finding the element, return `False` and `-1`.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function sequential_search(array, element):
       for index from 0 to length of array - 1:
           if array[index] is equal to element:
               return (True, index)
       return (False, -1)
   ```

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def sequential_search(array, element):
    # Iterate over the array with index
    for index in range(len(array)):
        # Check if the current element matches the target element
        if array[index] == element:
            # If found, return True and the index
            return (True, index)
    # If not found, return False and -1
    return (False, -1)
```

This solution iterates through the list, checking each element against the target. If it finds the target, it returns `True` and the index. If it doesn't find the target, it returns `False` and `-1`.

    ### Summary of Attempts to Solve the Problem

    The problem involves determining if a sequence of integers can be adjusted to sum to zero by performing operations where each element can be decreased by its index. The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.

    #### Key Insights and Strategies

    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.

    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.

    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.

    #### Final Solution

    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.

    ```python
    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):
        for test_case in test_cases:
            N = test_case[0]
            A = test_case[1]
        
            current_sum = 0
            possible = True
        
            for i in range(N):
                current_sum += A[i]
                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:
                print("YES")
            else:
                print("NO")

    # Read input
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    T = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(T):
        N = int(data[index])
        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))
        test_cases.append((N, A))
        index += N + 1

    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)
    ```

    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.
