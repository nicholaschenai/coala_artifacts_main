If the element is found, the function should return a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it should return a tuple with `False` and `-1`.\n\n### Conceptualize a Solution\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   - Iterate through the list using a loop.\n   - For each element in the list, check if it matches the target element.\n   - If a match is found, return `True` and the current index.\n   - If the loop completes without finding the element, return `False` and `-1`.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function sequential_search(array, element):\n       for index from 0 to length of array - 1:\n           if array[index] is equal to element:\n               return (True, index)\n       return (False, -1)\n   ```\n\n### Final Python Solution\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef sequential_search(array, element):\n    # Iterate over the array with index\n    for index in range(len(array)):\n        # Check if the current element matches the target element\n        if array[index] == element:\n            # If found, return True and the index\n            return (True, index)\n    # If not found, return False and -1\n    return (False, -1)\n```\n\nThis solution iterates through the list, checking each element against the target. If it finds the target, it returns `True` and the index. If it doesn't find the target, it returns `False` and `-1`."

The core concept here is understanding how the operation affects the sequence and how to leverage it to achieve a zero sum.\n\n    #### Key Insights and Strategies\n\n    1. **Operation Understanding**: The operation allows us to decrease an element `A[i]` by `i`, which means we can adjust each element by multiples of its index. This flexibility is crucial in determining if the sequence can be made to sum to zero.\n\n    2. **Cumulative Sum Approach**: The correct approach involves tracking the cumulative sum of the sequence as we process each element. The goal is to ensure that the cumulative sum can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. This involves checking if the cumulative sum can be balanced by the remaining elements.\n\n    3. **Mistakes and Corrections**: Initially, I misunderstood the requirement, thinking the sum needed to be a multiple of the sum of indices. This was incorrect. The correct approach is to ensure that the cumulative sum does not fall below a certain threshold as we process each element, and that it can be zeroed out by the end of the sequence.\n\n    #### Final Solution\n\n    The final solution involves iterating through the sequence, updating the cumulative sum, and checking if it can be adjusted to zero by the end of the sequence. The key check is ensuring that the cumulative sum is not less than the sum of the first `i` natural numbers at any point, and that it equals the sum of the first `N-1` natural numbers at the end.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases):\n        for test_case in test_cases:\n            N = test_case[0]\n            A = test_case[1]\n        \n            current_sum = 0\n            possible = True\n        \n            for i in range(N):\n                current_sum += A[i]\n                if current_sum < (i * (i + 1)) // 2:\n                    possible = False\n                    break\n        \n            if possible and current_sum == (N * (N - 1)) // 2:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n    # Read input\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n\n    T = int(data[0])\n    index = 1\n    test_cases = []\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(data[index])\n        A = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + N]))\n        test_cases.append((N, A))\n        index += N + 1\n\n    is_good_sequence_possible(T, test_cases)\n    ```\n\n    This experience highlighted the importance of correctly interpreting the problem constraints and operations, and how iterative checks can be used to ensure feasibility of a solution.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
