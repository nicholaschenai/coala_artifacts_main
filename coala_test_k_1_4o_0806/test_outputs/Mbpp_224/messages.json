Restate the problem in plain English\n\nWe need to write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the number of '1's in its binary representation.

Conceptualize a solution in plain English\n\nTo solve this problem, we can:\n- Convert the integer to its binary representation.\n- Count how many '1's are present in this binary string.\n\nPython provides a built-in function `bin()` that converts an integer to its binary representation as a string prefixed with '0b'. We can use this function and then count the '1's in the resulting string.\n\n### 3. Write a pseudocode solution\n\n1. Convert the integer to a binary string using `bin()`.\n2. Remove the '0b' prefix from the binary string.\n3. Count the number of '1's in the binary string.\n4. Return the count.\n\n### 4. Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments\n\n```python\ndef count_Set_Bits(n: int) -> int:\n    # Convert the number to its binary representation\n    binary_representation = bin(n)\n    \n    # Count the number of '1's in the binary representation\n    # We use slicing [2:] to remove the '0b' prefix\n    count_of_ones = binary_representation[2:].count('1')\n    \n    # Return the count of '1's\n    return count_of_ones\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of set bits in the binary representation of the given integer."

The operations allowed were dividing by 2 if `n` is even, or incrementing/decrementing by 1 if `n` is odd. The core concept here is to efficiently reduce `n` by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.\n\n    The key strategy was to always divide by 2 when `n` is even, as this is the most efficient way to reduce the number. For odd numbers, the decision to increment or decrement was based on the resulting number's divisibility by 4, which helps in further reducing the number quickly. A special case was when `n` is 3, where decrementing is optimal.\n\n    The solution involved a simple loop that repeatedly applied these rules until `n` became 1, counting the steps along the way. This approach was straightforward and effective, passing all test cases without any issues. The problem reinforced the importance of understanding number properties and making strategic decisions based on them. \n\n    Here is the final solution for reference:\n\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def integerReplacement(self, n: int) -> int:\n            steps = 0\n            while n != 1:\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    n //= 2\n                else:\n                    if n == 3 or (n - 1) % 4 == 0:\n                        n -= 1\n                    else:\n                        n += 1\n                steps += 1\n            return steps\n    ```\n[/Summary]\n\n"
