INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/456 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list where each string is reversed.

### Conceptualize a Solution

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - We will iterate over each string in the input list.
   - For each string, we will reverse it.
   - We will collect all the reversed strings into a new list.
   - Finally, we will return this new list of reversed strings.

### Pseudocode

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `reverse_string_list` that takes a list of strings as input.
   - Initialize an empty list `reversed_list` to store the reversed strings.
   - For each string `s` in the input list:
     - Reverse the string `s` using slicing (`s[::-1]`).
     - Append the reversed string to `reversed_list`.
   - Return `reversed_list`.

### Final Python Solution

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def reverse_string_list(strings: list) -> list:
    # Initialize an empty list to store the reversed strings
    reversed_list = []
    
    # Iterate over each string in the input list
    for s in strings:
        # Reverse the string using slicing and append to the reversed_list
        reversed_list.append(s[::-1])
    
    # Return the list of reversed strings
    return reversed_list
```

This function will take a list of strings, reverse each string, and return a new list containing the reversed strings.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process and comparing it with the official solution, here are some key insights:

    1. **Binary Reversal Logic**: Both my solution and the official solution correctly identified the need to reverse the binary representation of indices. The official solution uses a loop to construct the reversed binary string, which is a straightforward approach. My solution used Python's string manipulation capabilities to achieve the same result, which is more concise.

    2. **Index Conversion**: The official solution directly constructs the reversed binary string and converts it back to an integer. This is similar to my approach, where I used Python's `format` and slicing to reverse the binary string. Both methods are effective, but the official solution's loop-based approach might be more intuitive for those less familiar with Python's string manipulation functions.

    3. **Message Rearrangement**: Both solutions correctly rearrange the message based on the reversed indices. The official solution uses a list to store the rearranged message, which is then joined into a string for output. This is similar to my approach, where I also used a list to build the scrambled message.

    4. **Efficiency and Clarity**: The official solution is efficient and clear, using basic operations to achieve the desired result. My solution is also efficient, leveraging Python's built-in functions for binary conversion and string manipulation. Both solutions have similar time complexity, as they both iterate over the message and perform constant-time operations for each character.

    Overall, the problem was straightforward, and both solutions effectively addressed the task. The key takeaway is the importance of understanding binary manipulation and how reversing binary strings can be used to solve indexing problems.
