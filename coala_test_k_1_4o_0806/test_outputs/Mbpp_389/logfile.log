INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/389 [generation text] ### Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to write a function that calculates the nth Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but they start with 2 and 1. The sequence is defined as follows:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   To find the nth Lucas number, we can use an iterative approach. We start with the first two Lucas numbers, 2 and 1. For each subsequent number up to n, we calculate it by summing the two preceding numbers. This approach avoids the inefficiency of a recursive solution by using a loop to build up the sequence iteratively.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   ```
   function find_lucas(n):
       if n is 0:
           return 2
       if n is 1:
           return 1
       initialize two variables, a and b, to 2 and 1 respectively
       for i from 2 to n:
           calculate the next Lucas number as a + b
           update a to b
           update b to the newly calculated Lucas number
       return b
   ```

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def find_lucas(n: int) -> int:
    # Base cases for the first two Lucas numbers
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first two Lucas numbers
    a, b = 2, 1
    
    # Iteratively calculate the nth Lucas number
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        # Calculate the next Lucas number
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    # Return the nth Lucas number
    return b
```

This solution efficiently calculates the nth Lucas number using an iterative approach, which is both time and space efficient.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    The problem was straightforward, and my solution was correct and efficient. However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:

    1. **Formula Derivation**:
       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.
       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.

    2. **Handling the First Term**:
       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.

    3. **Efficiency**:
       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.

    4. **Code Simplicity**:
       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.

    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.

We need to write a function that calculates the nth Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but they start with 2 and 1. The sequence is defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

## Conceptual Solution

To find the nth Lucas number, we can use an iterative approach:
1. Start with the first two Lucas numbers: L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1.
2. For each subsequent number up to n, calculate the next Lucas number by summing the two preceding numbers.
3. Continue this process until we reach the nth Lucas number.

```
function find_lucas(n):
    if n == 0:

        return 1
    
    previous = 2

        next_lucas = previous + current
        previous = current
        current = next_lucas

## Final Python Solution

        next_lucas = previous + current
        previous = current
        current = next_lucas
    
    return current
```

This solution iteratively calculates the Lucas numbers up to the nth term, using a loop to update the values of the previous two terms. This approach is efficient and straightforward, with a time complexity of O(n).
