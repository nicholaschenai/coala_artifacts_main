The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but they start with 2 and 1. The sequence is defined as follows:\n   - L(0) = 2\n   - L(1) = 1\n   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n   To find the nth Lucas number, we can use an iterative approach. We start with the first two Lucas numbers, 2 and 1. For each subsequent number up to n, we calculate it by summing the two preceding numbers. This approach avoids the inefficiency of a recursive solution by using a loop to build up the sequence iteratively.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n   ```\n   function find_lucas(n):\n       if n is 0:\n           return 2\n       if n is 1:\n           return 1\n       initialize two variables, a and b, to 2 and 1 respectively\n       for i from 2 to n:\n           calculate the next Lucas number as a + b\n           update a to b\n           update b to the newly calculated Lucas number\n       return b\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef find_lucas(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base cases for the first two Lucas numbers\n    if n == 0:\n        return 2\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two Lucas numbers\n    a, b = 2, 1\n    \n    # Iteratively calculate the nth Lucas number\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        # Calculate the next Lucas number\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    \n    # Return the nth Lucas number\n    return b\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the nth Lucas number using an iterative approach, which is both time and space efficient."

However, the official solution provided a slightly different approach to calculating the N'th term in the series. Here's a breakdown of the key differences and insights:\n\n    1. **Formula Derivation**:\n       - My solution used the formula for the sum of squares: `S(N) = (N-1) * N * (2N-1) / 6`.\n       - The official solution uses a slightly different formula: `l = (n+1)*(2n+3)*(n+2)/6` after adjusting `n` by subtracting 2. This formula is mathematically equivalent but derived differently.\n\n    2. **Handling the First Term**:\n       - The official solution explicitly checks for `n == 1` and directly returns 0, which is a simple and clear way to handle the base case.\n\n    3. **Efficiency**:\n       - Both solutions are efficient and handle the constraints well, with a time complexity of O(1) per test case due to the direct computation using a formula.\n\n    4. **Code Simplicity**:\n       - The official solution is concise and directly uses integer division by converting the result to an integer, which is a minor difference but worth noting for simplicity.\n\n    Overall, both solutions effectively solve the problem, but the official solution provides an alternative formula that is equally valid. This experience reinforces the importance of understanding different mathematical derivations and how they can lead to equivalent solutions.\n[/Reflection]\n\n"
