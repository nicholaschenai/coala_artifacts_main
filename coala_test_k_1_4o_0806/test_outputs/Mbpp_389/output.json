    "raw_msg": "## Problem Restatement\n\nWe need to write a function that calculates the nth Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but they start with 2 and 1. The sequence is defined as follows:\n- L(0) = 2\n- L(1) = 1\n- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\nTo find the nth Lucas number, we can use an iterative approach:\n1. Start with the first two Lucas numbers: L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1.\n2. For each subsequent number up to n, calculate the next Lucas number by summing the two preceding numbers.\n3. Continue this process until we reach the nth Lucas number.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n```\nfunction find_lucas(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 2\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    previous = 2\n    current = 1\n    \n    for i from 2 to n:\n        next_lucas = previous + current\n        previous = current\n        current = next_lucas\n    \n    return current\n```\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef find_lucas(n: int) -> int:\n    # Base cases for the first two Lucas numbers\n    if n == 0:\n        return 2\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize the first two Lucas numbers\n    previous = 2\n    current = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the nth Lucas number iteratively\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        next_lucas = previous + current\n        previous = current\n        current = next_lucas\n    \n    return current\n```\n\nThis solution iteratively calculates the Lucas numbers up to the nth term, using a loop to update the values of the previous two terms. This approach is efficient and straightforward, with a time complexity of O(n).",
