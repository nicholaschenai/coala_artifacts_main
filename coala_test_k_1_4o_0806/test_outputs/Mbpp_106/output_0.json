    "raw_msg": "1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**\n\n   We need to create a function that takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain all the elements of the original tuple followed by all the elements of the list.\n\n2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**\n\n   To solve this problem, we can convert the list into a tuple and then concatenate it with the given tuple. This will result in a new tuple that contains all the elements of the original tuple followed by the elements of the list.\n\n3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**\n\n   - Convert the list to a tuple.\n   - Concatenate the original tuple with the new tuple created from the list.\n   - Return the resulting tuple.\n\n4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**\n\n```python\ndef add_lists(lst, tpl):\n    # Convert the list to a tuple\n    list_as_tuple = tuple(lst)\n    \n    # Concatenate the original tuple with the tuple created from the list\n    result = tpl + list_as_tuple\n    \n    # Return the resulting tuple\n    return result\n```\n\nThis function `add_lists` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the list to a tuple, concatenates it with the original tuple, and returns the new tuple.",
