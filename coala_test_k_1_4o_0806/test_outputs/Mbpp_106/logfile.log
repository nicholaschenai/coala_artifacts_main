INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/106 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

1. **Restate the problem in plain English:**
   We need to create a function that takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new tuple. This new tuple should contain all the elements of the original tuple followed by all the elements of the list.

2. **Conceptualize a solution in plain English:**
   - First, we need to convert the list into a tuple because tuples are immutable, and we cannot directly append a list to a tuple.
   - Then, we concatenate the original tuple with the newly converted tuple from the list.
   - Finally, return the concatenated tuple.

3. **Write a pseudocode solution:**
   - Define a function `add_lists` that takes two parameters: a list and a tuple.
   - Convert the list to a tuple.
   - Concatenate the original tuple with the converted tuple.
   - Return the concatenated tuple.

4. **Output the final Python 3 solution with your solution steps in comments:**

```python
def add_lists(lst, tpl):
    # Convert the list to a tuple
    list_as_tuple = tuple(lst)
    
    # Concatenate the original tuple with the converted tuple
    result = tpl + list_as_tuple
    
    # Return the concatenated tuple
    return result
```

This function will take a list and a tuple, convert the list to a tuple, concatenate it with the original tuple, and return the resulting tuple.

## Memories

[Reflection]:
    Reflecting on the problem-solving process for this pattern generation task, I encountered a few key insights:

    1. **Pattern Understanding**: The main challenge was correctly understanding the pattern generation logic. The pattern required alternating sequences of numbers, which was not immediately obvious. The official solution effectively captures this by using a list to manage the sequence and adjusting it iteratively.

    2. **Iterative Adjustment**: The official solution uses a list to build the sequence and then iteratively adjusts it by popping the last element and prepending a new number. This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's list operations to manage the sequence dynamically.

    3. **Output Formatting**: Ensuring the correct output format, especially with newlines between test cases, was crucial. The official solution handles this implicitly by printing each test case's result separately, which aligns with the expected output format.

    In future pattern generation problems, it will be beneficial to:
    - Clearly define the pattern logic before coding.
    - Consider using data structures like lists to dynamically adjust sequences.
    - Pay close attention to output formatting requirements to match expected results. 

    This experience highlighted the importance of thoroughly understanding the problem requirements and leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for efficient sequence manipulation.
