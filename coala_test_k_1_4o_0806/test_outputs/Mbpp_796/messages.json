The dictionary will have strings as keys and integers as values.\n\n## Conceptual Solution\n\n1. Extract all the values from the dictionary.\n2. Sum these values.\n3. Return the sum.\n\n## Pseudocode\n\n1. Define a function `return_sum` that takes a dictionary `d` as an argument.\n2. Use the `values()` method of the dictionary to get all the values.\n3. Use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of these values.\n4. Return the result.\n\n## Final Python Solution\n\n```python\ndef return_sum(d: dict) -> int:\n    # Get all the values from the dictionary\n    values = d.values()\n    # Calculate the sum of the values\n    total_sum = sum(values)\n    # Return the sum\n    return total_sum\n```"

The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.\n\n    ### Key Concepts:\n    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.\n    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.\n\n    ### Strategy:\n    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.\n    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.\n    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.\n\n    ### Code Snippet:\n    ```python\n    class Solution:\n        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n            prefix_sums = {0: 1}\n            current_sum = 0\n            count = 0\n        \n            for num in nums:\n                current_sum += num\n                needed_sum = current_sum - k\n                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]\n                if current_sum in prefix_sums:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1\n                else:\n                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1\n        \n            return count\n    ```\n\n    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.\n[/Summary]\n\n"
