INFO - [Task id] Mbpp/796 [generation text] ## Problem Restatement

We need to write a function called `return_sum` that takes a dictionary as input and returns the sum of all its values. The dictionary will have strings as keys and integers as values.

## Conceptual Solution

1. Extract all the values from the dictionary.
2. Sum these values.
3. Return the sum.

## Pseudocode

1. Define a function `return_sum` that takes a dictionary `d` as an argument.
2. Use the `values()` method of the dictionary to get all the values.
3. Use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of these values.
4. Return the result.

## Final Python Solution

```python
def return_sum(d: dict) -> int:
    # Get all the values from the dictionary
    values = d.values()
    # Calculate the sum of the values
    total_sum = sum(values)
    # Return the sum
    return total_sum
```

## Memories

[Summary]:
    In this problem, the goal was to find the number of continuous subarrays within an array of integers that sum up to a given integer `k`. The core concept here is the use of prefix sums and a hashmap to efficiently track and count subarrays that meet the criteria.

    ### Key Concepts:
    - **Prefix Sums**: By maintaining a running sum of elements as we iterate through the array, we can quickly determine if a subarray sums to `k` by checking if a certain prefix sum has been encountered before.
    - **HashMap for Frequency Counting**: The hashmap stores the frequency of each prefix sum encountered, allowing us to determine how many subarrays end at the current index with a sum of `k`.

    ### Strategy:
    - Initialize a hashmap with a default entry for a prefix sum of 0, which helps handle cases where a subarray starts from the beginning of the array.
    - As we iterate through the array, update the running sum and check if the difference between the current sum and `k` exists in the hashmap. If it does, increment the count by the frequency of that difference.
    - Update the hashmap with the current running sum to account for future subarrays.

    ### Code Snippet:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
            prefix_sums = {0: 1}
            current_sum = 0
            count = 0
        
            for num in nums:
                current_sum += num
                needed_sum = current_sum - k
                if needed_sum in prefix_sums:
                    count += prefix_sums[needed_sum]
                if current_sum in prefix_sums:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
                else:
                    prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1
        
            return count
    ```

    This approach efficiently solves the problem in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints. The use of prefix sums and a hashmap is a powerful pattern for solving problems involving subarray sums.
